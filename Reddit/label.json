  "Probably one of the best defenses of the current status quo (which I disagree with) is that there is actually no discrimination going on, only perceived discrimination.  Nothing prevents a gay man from exercising the same right that a straight man has - both can marry a woman.  What the gay lobby is asking is for a creation of a new right, allowing a man to marry a man and a woman to marry a woman.  Not even straight people have those rights.\n\nThe difference is that the gay man is not attracted and has no interest in marrying a woman, but that is a matter of choice.  The logic here is that if we are extending the right to marry to anyone (as described above) then what justification is there to restrict based on other personal choices?  What if three men and two women want to be married as a single unit?\n\nNow, I find it compelling only because of the last argument.  Marriage should be a union between as many willing and consenting adults as they would like.  We have enough partnership law to use for divorce and arrangements, but would allow that to be superseded by pre- or post-nuptial agreements.  And if we are doing this for benefits and not on \"reproduction\" does the ban on incestuous marriage still make sense?  I love my sister more than many other people... if she needed health insurance, why couldn't we arrange a \"marriage\" so she could get it through my work?",

  "That is under the assumption that the single industry still exists. I agree that many cities, states, and even nations can survive on single industries, Hell Michigan in the early 1900's attests to that fact. However, GM is an 18th of what it once was in Michigan, and that is a generous figure. Plants (the ones that are still open) that used to run on 3,000 workers a day are now operating with 50 people. Bottom line is Michigan has to find a new industry but that is going to be hard to do with ghost towns, a broken infrastructure, ever growing crime, a collapsing school system, and an eviscerated tax base. They need a miracle. \n\nAnd like I said I'm not blaming either party. The Dems were in office when the economy collapsed and the Reps are in office now that they are trying to rebuild. As much as I hate Snyder he was given a turd to polish into gold. I don't care the banner of anyone's politics, there is no coming back from economic collapse on that scale, not quickly anyway. \n\nEdit: and for the \"not borrowing constantly bit\" Detroit and Michigan literally had no other option. You can't take a city with 2 million people, dwindle it down to 700,000, and think that those people are going to be able to support the city with 2/3rds of it's tax base missing. Even more if you consider the fact that the only people really left in Detroit are the poor. The tax base is more than likely to be closer to a 10th of what it once was. If Detroit didn't borrow to try and revive the city everyone would have had to just let the city fall into 3rd world conditions. Everyone would have had to have left. There wouldn't have been anyway to fund the police stations, fire stations, schools, trash pick-up, sewage, electricity, water infrastructure, public transportation,etc. etc. The only thing they can do now is destroy half the city, let nature retake it, and start over with what they have left. That is going to take an investment, and right now the state of Michigan isn't able afford the loans or the grants to do so. ",

  "As a strong proponent of the current system, I'll bite.\n\nWe don't need voting system reform because the current system is the best for the needs of the United States. Single-Member District Plurality (also called First Past the Post) gives individual representatives the freedom to represent the interests of their district before the interests of their political parties. What basically happens is that coalitions between ideological factions happen before the elections instead of after them like other systems.\n\nProportional Representation systems (like Germany, Italy, and France) cause the country to be ruled unilaterally by a single ideological group that the majority of the country voted against. It also breeds political radicalism that tends to be contained by restricting freedom of speech. There are more ideological groups holding seats in the legislature, but only one dictating policy.\n\nAlternative voting methods like Instant-Runoff Voting or Cumulative Voting tend to create governments with the negative aspects of both SMDP and PR. They create larger third parties that are able to hold seats but not affect policy while the two main parties turn into ideological monoliths rather than the vague associations they are in SMDP. This causes a stagnant political atmosphere that polarizes the country.\n\nOne thing to always keep in mind is that between 10-20% of the population in most liberal democracies is bigoted xenophobic nationalists. In systems like the US, this demographic either doesn't vote or votes Republican and the party maybe throws out a few comments to pander to the voter base but ultimately doesn't dictate policy based on their ideology. In France, this bloc forms a political party called the National Front that has a significant influence on policy. It also drags the center-right party to adopt more radical stances to take their voters and keep the radical party's power down. In Germany, this group is repressed by restrictions on civil liberties and occasionally riots in the streets. Systems that favor centrism tend to work out better for the people living in them.\n\nThe problem with voting in the US is that people in the current generation never learned how to use the system. Since coalitions are formed prior to the elections, primary elections are extremely important in affecting policy. The Tea Party is an excellent case study in how to actually affect policy in the US. They did everything right, including forwarding candidates within the Republican party, making sure those candidates were elected via primary elections, and making incumbent Republicans pander to their ideology.\n\nI'll admit I'm a little intoxicated right now, so I might not have explained things completely.

If a woman in TN has breast cancer and only makes $13k she cannot get Medicaid and **she loses the state program as well**. Another woman in New York of equal circumstances gets treated (with federal taxes in part paid in TN). The ACA prohibits her state from helping her get treated. The question is if the ACA may constitutionally require the woman in TN to just die? Is this equal access per the 14th Amendment? Tennessee says that the ACA is just too expensive for it to afford.\n\n\"*The director of InterFaith Health Clinic said that even with the health insurance exchanges that are now enrolling and take effect Jan. 1, a \"huge chunk\" of people who seek care at InterFaith will remain uninsured. \nThat's because their income is too high to qualify for TennCare and too low to qualify for the exchanges -- the segment of the population that would have been covered by Medicaid had Tennessee chosen to expand Medicaid*\" http://insurancenewsnet.com/oarticle/2013/10/19/medical-clinics-brace-for-changes-under-aca-%5Bthe-knoxville-news-sentinel-tenn%5D-a-406888.html#.UsiCIrQ6zXQ\n\n*   Indiana says that the ACA would require Indiana to divert money from schools to health care if they accepted it. All of the states will likely have to reduce school funding to pay for ObamaCare if they accept it, so this is a legitimate point. Do we agree that few states have that much cash lying around, that most will need to shift education funds? 63% of their budget goes to education. The ACA would cost Indiana $1.4 billion. **Most (or all) of that $1.4 billion would come from the $18.6 billion school budget.**\n\n\"*Indiana spends about 63 percent of its budget on education. Last year, the General Assembly increased education funding to restore cuts made during the worst of the recession... Currently, one out of six Indiana residents is on Medicaid, or about 1.1 million Hoosiers. Medicaid takes up 14 percent of the state's budget. Under the federal Affordable Care Act (or Obamacare), Indiana can expand Medicaid to cover more uninsured Hoosiers at a projected cost to taxpayers of more than $1.4 billion by 2020.

The real reason they report the news with a heavy bias and are often accused of simply falsifying facts is primarily due to the fact that there is a sizable demographic of Americans who turn on the news not to be informed but rather to hear exactly what they want to hear. Therefore, it's a smart business decision to cater to that audience by giving them only the news that they want to hear in the way that they want to hear it, because that's what keeps them coming back. \n\nThe sad fact of the matter is that good, honest journalism simply isn't profitable anymore, at least in the United States, and you see the effects of that across all of the major TV news outlets. The current trend in TV news is to turn it into an entertainment program for the masses to enjoy and consume rather than an educational program of sorts designed to distribute facts and information.

  "I disagree with the premise (as a former FiDi resident and a lawyer). Occupy moved the ball forwards on a number of issues -- it's not a trivial victory that, in the months after Occupy started, House Republicans actually started to talk about economic equality as something serious. Occupy may not have forced any real change, but they did flag serious issues that are now getting serious consideration, in a more real way than they did before. \n\n(Note that, despite electing a few congressmen and attaining wider visibility, the Tea Party hasn't been any more successful than that.)\n\nThat said, there are a number of things that should have been done differently to maximize impact, but they're all problems inherent in a quasi-anarchic movement.\n \n* Occupy needed a leader who could talk to the press.\n\n* Occupy needed a leader who could define specific goals.\n\n* Occupy needed to advertise those goals.\n\n* Occupy needed a leader who could keep out the riff-raff -- i.e., people who just went to Zuccotti Park to smoke weed, commit crimes, or otherwise be creepy. I walked through/by Zuccotti commonly, and anyone who was there knows where that group was (towards the back, by the WTC). That made the movement all-too-easy to villify. Occupy also lost cohesion once it was infected by communists, Paul supporters, and anti-Semites (see below). \n\n* Occupy needed to excise any outright allegiance with atheism, Marxism, communism, and true socialism (state ownership of the means of production). This is not a society ready to toss out The System. This is a society ready to reform the system. Outright revolution is justly ridiculed. \n\n* Occupy did a good job cleaning up the park, and making the space livable. But they needed to do better. They lost support from the neighbourhood once the near-24-hour-drum-circle started up. Seriously, many of my friends living within a few blocks had to wear earplugs to sleep, for months. That's just one example.\n\n* Occupy needed to not do dumb marches that would inevitably end in arrests. \n\nFrom that, I conclude that quasi-anarchic movements should not be things. A (1) well-organized, (2) clearly-focused, (3) presentable, (4) left-leaning-but-not-Marxist group that (a) had lobbyists, (b) friends in government, (c) clear, legal, and implementable demands was doable and would have gone farther.

  "Force of habit, really.\n\n***New Hampshire*** has had very early primaries for a long time, because during spring primaries the roads would be so muddy that farmers couldn't make it into town to vote.  So New Hampshire decided to hold them before the spring thaw.  I forget when they started (I recall 1912 offhand) but I know there's a set of plaques in Concord that list the recent winners, starting with Estes Kefauver, a senator from Tennessee, in 1952.\n\nIn truth, though, the New Hampshire primary, and primaries in general, had limited impact before 1968.  I know Kennedy dueled Humphrey in a few primaries in 1960, but that was more to show strength than to win delegates.  Most delegates were assigned by party bosses, leading to nominations being decided in the proverbial smoke-filled rooms.  I believe Henry Cabot Lodge won the New Hampshire primary one year without even campaigning, while he was ambassador to Vietnam.\n\nThings started changing in 1968 when LBJ, the sitting president, barely beat anti-war candidate Eugene McCarthy in the New Hampshire primary.  McCarthy's surprising show of strength prompted Bobby Kennedy to join the race about a week later, and LBJ to drop out soon after.  After the 1968 Democratic National Convention was fraught with ugly conflict between party regulars and protesters, a commission headed by Senator George McGovern revised the nomination process to shift power away from party bosses and towards primary voters.\n\nSo it was not a coincidence that the 1972 nomination went to the candidate who best knew the new system, George McGovern.  Along with his campaign manager, Gary Hart (who would almost win the nomination himself twelve years later), McGovern found innovative ways of picking up delegates during the primaries.  One idea was to focus on the ***Iowa*** caucuses, which had been around before but never received any attention.  McGovern correctly realized that if he, as a lesser-known candidate, won the Iowa caucuses, he would receive more attention and hopefully a better share of the vote in later primaries.  The plan worked, and he won the nomination.  Iowa's status as a major step in the nomination process was confirmed four years later, when a governor of Georgia no one had heard of camped out in Iowa, won the caucuses, and became history's greatest monster,^1 Jimmy Carter.\n\nEver since, other states have tried getting in on some of that early-contest action.  Delaware made a strong push in 1996 I think, and Michigan and Florida both tried jumping the line in 2008, but DNC rules punish the delegations of states that go before Iowa or New Hampshire.  New Hampshire even has a state law that the primary has to go seven days before any other primary.  So although other states attempting to cut in front was a quadrennial tradition for decades, Iowa and New Hampshire have remained the first.\n\nSo the trick other states have ended up using is not competing with Iowa or New Hampshire, but coming up with a gimmick of their own.  I honestly don't recall when ***South Carolina*** started using the \"First in the South\" slogan, but I know it was the third contest in 2000, when George W. Bush and John McCain had quite the street fight in South Carolina when it looked like McCain might knock Bush out of the nomination.  (He didn't.)  South Carolina was a major factor in the 2004 Democratic contest as well, and its hold as First in the South seems to have solidified.  (It looks like the Nevada caucuses are solidifying up as \"First in the West\" as well.)\n\nI'm doing this all offhand, so if anyone wants any sources or thinks I may be off on any of the details, please let me know and I'll look into it.\n\n1.  It's a Simpsons joke!  I love Carter.",

  "&gt;  I think it\u2019s funny that the 80/20 rule works for wealth distribution\u2026 and natural phenomena\u2026 (Just read on Wikipedia). \n\nYeah ... zipf's law. And the small-world network people and the chaos people will tell you that 1/f distributions ('scale free') are a sign of self-organization. Order out of chaos. Which means *that* income distribution may well be a natural phenomena in a complex dynamic network system (the economy) as much as a stable ecosystem made of of populations of evolved creatures.\n\n&gt; On the topic of Wall street funding main street, in regards to hedge funds you won\u2019t believe. 100 plus million will be tied up in an investment for years\u2026. and how many people work in the back office? Usually 5-10. Maybe 20 if its billion plus firm \n\nWell, there are certainly outsized portfolios and returns per-person working at the fund. I agree with that. And the LPs are \"locked up\" for a while. I agree. The fund itself may move in and out of different positions more rapidly, though. Each \"hedge fund\" (which has over time become a fairly vague term) has a \"schtick\" or a \"trick\", an investment thesis, via which they generate their \"how we make our returns that beat the market\" story. Whatever. Do they help provide liquidity to the market at large? Maybe. I don't know. Does better market liquidity help main street? Maybe. I don't know. I can't argue for or against the modern form of hedge funds because I really don't know anything about them any more. They've changed too much since I did know something, and I haven't kept up. \n\nMy worry about main-street as intersects 'wall-street' is two-fold: Depository Financial Institutions (Consumer and merchant banks with checking and savings accounts) should not be able to use that DDA aggregate to collateralize market bets. Glass-stegal kind of got rid of that. Under Clinton (yes, with a Republican congress) we got rid of this for some reason. I don't know why we got rid of it, but it doesn't seem to have been positive. So, that's One. Number two is that when banks (these depository account asset banks) *should* be making their money doing \"loans\" to main-street. Yes, in current times they need to be careful (due-diligence). I get that. They aren't VC. But with essentially 0% interest rates, why would they lend *any* money. They essentially don't. Which is a problem for all of us ... because savings and loans is what they are supposed to do!\n\n&gt; It\u2019s true the rich may thrive on American wealth but let\u2019s not get too cozy about it. Our economic situation is not going to improve unless we do something about it.\n\nAgreed. So the question is to define the problem. What is one of the problems? Unemployment. Why? Labor not needed. Why? No (global) demand for American built products and services, at the price America can make/deliver them. Right? \n\nTell evil capitalists to hire more? To do what? There's no demand for American-built products. Why not? Expensive. Raise minimum wage? That makes it worse -- products more expensive. \"The rich should fix it\" -- well, they *do* fix their problem ... by exporting labor requirements to China and robots. Still leaves us with unemployment.\n\nSo, to solve unemployment, we need more demand for products/services. OK, --give-- everyone a job, those people will have demand? Well, sure -- they'll demand cheap products from China. American employer's will go bankrupt (no customers) and we are ... right back here.\n\nThen, what do we do about it? Well, let's break this down: why isn't America competitive with it's ability to build inexpensive consumer products? (Ignoring the fact that we are -- America is the largest manufacturing country in the world; we just don't need that many people to do it...)\n\nHint1: There is an answer to this core problem, if you break it down to its core elements.\n\nHint2: Having the government mandate prosperity has never in the history of the world ever worked.\n\nWe can chat about this later. I like talking to you! :-)\n\n",

  "&gt; avoid the more controversial aspects of Libertarianism such as relaxed regulations... \n\nWhy is \"relaxed regulations\" a controversial aspect?  The only way for such a loose phrase can be is basically begging the question - you assume that the current level of regulation is either ideal or actually too little and that all the current regulations are needed.  Neither are necessarily true.  For a long time I've said that Occupy and the Tea Party are not necessarily at odds - I could easily convince some of my Tea Party friends to support more social service nets if we were to go through government and cut out what it does poorly/isn't really needed.  [Here is the website](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collectionCfr.action?selectedYearFrom=2013&amp;go=Go) that lists the regulations, for 2013 (the last annual update).  Turn of the century the length was something around 130k+ pages.  So thinking that maybe there are a bunch of regulations that could be removed is somehow controversial?  Heck, if only 1% of those regulations were just redundant or had someone reporting to multiple authorities, that would be 1.3k of pages removed.\n\n&gt;...and isolationist foreign policy\n\nI think this is probably where you can get some traction, but at the same time the Democratic party and the far-left continually harm on our military spending.  Is it really that controversial then to reduce our involvement in the world?",
