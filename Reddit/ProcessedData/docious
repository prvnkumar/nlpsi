Firstly it is a proxy war.

The \"rebels\" carrying out the \"dirty work\" on the ground, can then effectively allow the US Airforce to (and possibly covertly) SLAM target these weapon caches.

The [Levada centre](http://www.levada.ru/) is probably your best bet for finding out public opinion.

That is a very big difference, one that would be hard to explain away as pure statistical chance or \u201cbad data.\u201d Looking at the numbers, it would appear that Putin\u2019s decision to categorically reject any attempted Western military involvement in Syria is popular among Russians. \n\n&gt;There is just very little enthusiasm for \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d style military engagements, which is hardly surprising considering the sort of people that are soon going to be running Libya (hint: they\u2019re Islamists!) and Russia\u2019s own severe problems with violent Islamic extremism.\n\n&gt;Many Russians, for better or worse, have a very different understanding of the way the world ought to work and simply don\u2019t agree with the Western consensus. In the United States the discussion isn\u2019t over whether we ought to \u201cdo something\u201d in Syria, it\u2019s a tactical argument over how we should intervene. Should it be sanctions? Arms shipments to the rebels? Targeted airstrikes? A massive anti-government bombing campaign? In Russia, however, most people really don\u2019t see the need to do anything at all and they certainly don\u2019t think that there ought to be a military campaign a la Libya. While some of Putin\u2019s policies are genuinely unpopular and could reasonably be expected to change should the Russian government become more democratic, there is no evidence whatsoever that a more \u201cdemocratic\u201d Russia would be more amenable to Western efforts to overthrow Bashar al Assad. That\u2019s worth remembering the next time that someone says Russia\u2019s current policies towards Syria are purely about Putin need to defend a fellow member of the dictator\u2019s club.\n\n\n**Here's the link to the poll (it's in Russian) - http://www.levada.ru/28-03-2012/rossiya-v-sisteme-mezhdunarodnykh-otnoshenii-gruziya-siriya-irak**", "edited": 1371729135, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1gorax", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_camlmey", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1371725305", "ups": 9, "distinguished": null}], "clicked": false, "title": "What do Russian Citizens think about the Syrian conflict?", "media": null, "base10id": 88495161, "id": "t3_1gorax", "score": 33, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 9, "saved": false, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1gorax/what_do_russian_citizens_think_about_the_syrian/", "name": "t3_1gorax", "created": 1371710057, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1gorax/what_do_russian_citizens_think_about_the_syrian/", "author_flair_text": null, "author": "docious", "created_utc": 1371681257, "distinguished": null, "num_comments": 17, "num_reports": null, "ups": 42}
