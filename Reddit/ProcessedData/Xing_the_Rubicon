Frank J. Wilson investigated Capone's income tax violations, which the government decided was more likely material for a conviction. In 1931 Capone was indicted for income tax evasion and various violations of the Volstead Act (Prohibition) at the Chicago Federal Building in the courtroom of Judge James Herbert Wilkerson. His attorneys made a plea deal, but the presiding judge warned he might not follow the sentencing recommendation from the prosecution. Capone withdrew his plea of guilty.\n\n&gt;His attempt to bribe and intimidate the potential jurors was discovered by Ness's men, The Untouchables. The venire (jury pool) was switched with one from another case, and Capone was stymied. Following a long trial, on October 17 the jury returned a mixed verdict, finding Capone guilty of five counts of tax evasion and failing to file tax returns (the Volstead Act violations were dropped). The judge sentenced him to 11 years imprisonment, at the time the longest tax evasion sentence ever given, along with heavy fines, and liens were filed against his various properties. His appeals of both the conviction and the sentence were denied. One of the Capone properties seized by the federal government was an armored limousine. The limousine was later used to protect President Franklin D. Roosevelt after the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\n&gt;In ... \n`(Truncated at 1500 characters)`\n\n---\n\n[^(about AutoWikibot)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| *^\\/u/xrelaht ^can ^reply ^with ^'delete'. ^Will ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less.*  ^| ^[**Summon**](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1wc2n8", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cf17026", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1390941562", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "xrelaht", "id": "t1_cf16zzg", "parent_id": "t1_cf109mp", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1435514145, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ah, tax violation: [backup charge for over 80 years!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Capone#Conviction_and_imprisonment)", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1wc2n8", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cf16zzg", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1390941557", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Xing_the_Rubicon", "id": "t1_cf109mp", "parent_id": "t1_cf0x1q0", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1432144732, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cf109mp", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1390927948", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}

Frank J. Wilson investigated Capone's income tax violations, which the government decided was more likely material for a conviction. In 1931 Capone was indicted for income tax evasion and various violations of the Volstead Act (Prohibition) at the Chicago Federal Building in the courtroom of Judge James Herbert Wilkerson. His attorneys made a plea deal, but the presiding judge warned he might not follow the sentencing recommendation from the prosecution. Capone withdrew his plea of guilty.\n\n&gt;His attempt to bribe and intimidate the potential jurors was discovered by Ness's men, The Untouchables. The venire (jury pool) was switched with one from another case, and Capone was stymied. Following a long trial, on October 17 the jury returned a mixed verdict, finding Capone guilty of five counts of tax evasion and failing to file tax returns (the Volstead Act violations were dropped). The judge sentenced him to 11 years imprisonment, at the time the longest tax evasion sentence ever given, along with heavy fines, and liens were filed against his various properties. His appeals of both the conviction and the sentence were denied. One of the Capone properties seized by the federal government was an armored limousine. The limousine was later used to protect President Franklin D. Roosevelt after the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\n&gt;In ... \n`(Truncated at 1500 characters)`\n\n---\n\n[^(about AutoWikibot)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| *^\\/u/xrelaht ^can ^reply ^with ^'delete'. ^Will ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less.*  ^| ^[**Summon**](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1wc2n8", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cf17026", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1390941562", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "xrelaht", "id": "t1_cf16zzg", "parent_id": "t1_cf109mp", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1435514145, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ah, tax violation: [backup charge for over 80 years!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Capone#Conviction_and_imprisonment)", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1wc2n8", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cf16zzg", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1390941557", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Xing_the_Rubicon", "id": "t1_cf109mp", "parent_id": "t1_cf0x1q0", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1432144732, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cf109mp", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1390927948", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "jimbles1", "id": "t1_cf0x1q0", "parent_id": "t1_cf0kp4s", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1432143067, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1wc2n8", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cf0x1q0", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1390919881", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;Gay marriage, a civil-rights issue, could be legalized nationally by the federal gov't. \n\nThis depends on what you mean by \"legalized\".

In NYC everything is going to be more expensive: staff salaries, office rent, TV and radio ads, etc. \n\nEven more problematic is the Senate side, where a the number of people/voters represented by a Senator can vary by tens of millions.

I don't understand *why* its even worth measuring.\n\nI mean, you said \"it provides a baseline for comparison across time periods,\" but that doesn't even mean much because of things like inflation, increase/decrease in savings, how much debt people are willing to take, and possibly political policies. I mean, from year to year, it might be useful... but to compare 2000-2010 to 1900-1910 wouldn't make much sense to me either.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ce8o2l2", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1387828028", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_ce8fic8", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428013961, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ce8matb", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1387823897", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_ce88sb1", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428017131, "controversiality": 0, "body": "What does it represent?", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ti6d4", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ce8fic8", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1387802083", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_ce889q7", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428020363, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ti6d4", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ce88sb1", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1387772219", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

But her accomplishments outside of being a partner to Bill (which, based on their marriage is not an insignificant thing) are somewhat modest. She was a corporate lawyer on her own. That's something that was really on her own. She received Board appointments and other work because she was married to the Arkansas Attorney General and Governor. She was First Lady and oversaw a disastrous health care plan. She was elected as a celebrity as New York's Senator where she served competently if not necessarily in a spectacular fashion. Same with her appointment as Secretary of State. Both of these positions more than prepared her for the presidency. Particularly if you look at our current president who had virtually no qualifications and no real experience for the job. And, while he hasn't accomplished much, the country is still doing fairly well. So that's my opinion. I think Hilary made her peace in the sixties when it was still very much a mans world on who could take them further as the point person, her or Bill.

However, the Vermont law has few requirements before the system can take effect. First the system must have a 3-year budget that shows the single payer system will cost less than the current system, -AND- the state must acquire a waiver (permission) from the federal government to use federal dollars for a state-level single-payer system.  \n\nPolitically, the law had to make concessions to major employers in the state, like IBM, who fund their employees healthcare through a national system of their own. Further, it's questionable if Republicans in Washington would allow the waiver to go through without serious opposition. The specter of an incubator single-payer state could pose a threat to their platform and the legacy of their primary agenda from 2009 forward, especially if it was successful, and most certainly if it cost less. \n\nIf successful, other states would likely follow. We could see a gradual adoption of single-payer systems across the United States. If a handful of states demonstrated it worked over a period of time, it may reach the necessary popular support to at least force a federal vote on a national single-payer system. \n\nIn theory, in a single-payer system, it's better to have a larger pool of participants than a smaller one, because this spreads the risk among a larger number of people - which is of course the point of acquiring any form of insurance. Thus, proponents of single-payer systems argue that a national system would be \"better\" than having 50 separate state-level single-payer systems. \n\nKeep in mind, it would likely take 10+ years for enough states to adopt and demonstrate success independently for a vote in Washington on a national system to ever happen. \n\nMany single-payer advocates suggest the federal government could expand Medicare rather simply by changing the law to cover everyone rather than just those over 65 years in age, which in effect would create a national single-payer system.

Germany would also, in theory, still have regional alliances in Europe, and together they would keep Russia at bay. \n\nI'm not sure why you claim Israel would need to use nuclear weapons within 10 years if \"our troops left\" considering that we currently have zero troops in Israel. \n\nAssuming Iran doesn't develop nuclear weapons, their military capabilities would be limited to regional incursions. Saudi Arabia and Turkey would provide regional balance. If needed, either Turkey or Saudi Arabia could put up a good fight against Iran individually. Together, they would have the advantage.

They can barely find their tanks, much less use them to fight in.  While they have good individuals (I have worked with a couple) their force overall is where the sons of the wealthy go to play soldier.  They are not capable of maintaining their own equipment, drive a vehicle until it breaks then call the mechanics to come make it work again, rinse and repeat.\n\nTurkey is not as much of a Persian Gulf state, while they might be capable of intervening, their success in doing so in the Gulf is questionable.  Along the Mediterranean it is very plausible.  Iran doesn't actually have to fight anyone to win here, just make it seem like there are better options than fighting.  This is without mentioning if they would *want* to get involved.  They have lingering issues with Greece and Russia would doubtlesly start meddling.  Iran has been a client state for the Russians for some time and I don't see that changing.\n\nYou underestimate how things work in the region.  The US has kept the various countries from working together for some time, the threat of violence from our military is the big stick.  Troops don't have to be in Israel for this to work and when the Muslim world gets back to cooperation in regards to Israel they will be forced to take whatever measures are necessary to *try* to stay alive.\n\n&gt;Pulling out of Germany wouldn't matter nearly as much.\n\nNever said it would have a huge imapct on Germany, only that it would drop a billion or so out of their economy.  And *you* are completely wrong about how that would all work.  Germany is still viewed with hostile eyes, they would face stiff resistance if they deployed their military in any fashion not deemed strictly defensive.  And this is just within their own borders, then they would have to overcome the resistance from **outside** Germany.\n\n&gt; Other than immediate concerns of South Korea facing invasion from the North\n\nThe ROK is no joke all on their own.  We are the older brother in this relationship, but they are not incompetent.  IMHO, North Korea *might* be more willing to work with a ROK that has no US troops on its soil.  But the NorKs are not exactly in a great position with their military, lots of tubes to shoot artillery from, but their soldiers are as malnoursihed as the rest of their citizens.\n\n&gt; If Japan suddenly needed to provide for 100% of it's own defense, the strain on its economy would be massive. Relative to it's population and its economy, Japan by far spends the least amount of money on its military.\n\nThey also have a large population of young, single men with no prospects of finding women who want anything to do with them, a distinct un/underemployment problem and they would be facing a China without the stumbling block of the US military hanging around.  Again, they would face significant internal issues with any military action not *distinctly* justifiable as well as the entire region being antsy with them gearing up for war.  On top of that, they have to go through whatever their process is for changing their Constitiution to allow for an offensive capability (face it, they would need it sooner rather than later).\n\nWhile Japan would have to create a large debt and reform their culture (at this point pacifism dominates), if they apply their technological edge they could become a very formidable force.  Again.\n\nThe US also has no troops in Taiwan, but our presence in the region is the only thing that has held back China from making any attempt at taking back the RoC.  The Taiwanese military is excellent, one of the best in the world, they would be swamped between the size of the PLA forces and the distianct advances in technology made possible by the espionage programs carried out in the past 20 years.  Essentially, could the Taiwanese military kill enough of the PLA to stop them from trying?", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdo54eq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1385558860", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1rjfqh", "selftext": "You're the one who is way off.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "**Alaska**\n\nMarijuana reformers in Alaska have been hard at work trying to make their state the next to legalize pot. In June, a ballot measure to tax and regulate pot and legalize it for adult recreational use was certified. Organizers must now collect at least 30,169 valid signatures of registered Alaska voters by December 2013, which would ensure that the initiative receives a vote in the primary election on Aug. 19, 2014.\n\nPot has already been decriminalized and legalized for medical use in Alaska. A survey of Alaska voters taken earlier this year by Democratic-leaning Public Policy Polling found that 54 percent supported legalizing marijuana.\n\n**Arizona**\n\nIn June, marijuana legalization proponents began a campaign to gather the 259,213 signatures they'll need in order to get the issue on the 2014 ballot. The language of the proposed measure is rather expansive, and also includes a system of state taxation and regulation.\n\nMarijuana was legalized in the state for medical use in 2010 by ballot initiative. A poll taken earlier this year found that 56 percent of Arizonans supported legalizing some amount of cannabis.\n\n**California**\n\nA statewide initiative to legalize marijuana failed in California in 2010, but reformers are hoping to find success in 2014 and beyond. Earlier this month, organizers filed the California Hemp Act 2014, a measure that would legalize cannabis both in its standard and non-psychoactive forms. Beginning Oct. 1, the campaign will have 150 days to gather 750,000 valid signatures from California voters in order to get the issue on the 2014 ballot.\n\nMarijuana has already been decriminalized and legalized for medical use in California. A poll taken earlier this year found that 54 percent of Californians support legalizing pot.\n\n**Nevada**\n\nMarijuana advocates in Nevada have yet to mount a large-scale effort to get legalization on the ballot in an upcoming election, as most organizers in the state see 2016 as their best chance for a push. The liberal bent of the state makes it a popular target for reformers, however, and it's not yet clear whether Thursday's DOJ decision could increase desire for more immediate action.\n\nNevada has legalized medical marijuana, and earlier this year the state passed a measure establishing a dispensary system to help increase access for sick citizens. According to a recent poll, 56 percent of Nevadans would favor legalizing cannabis for recreational use if the money raised went to fund education.\n\n**Oregon**\n\nMedical marijuana legalization advocates in Oregon have already announced plans to campaign for an initiative to be placed on the ballot in 2014. An earlier legalization effort, which was poorly coordinated and widely mocked inside the state, failed in 2012. Organizers believe there is plenty of room for improvement.\n\nOregon has already decriminalized marijuana and legalized it for medical use. According to a poll taken in May, 57 percent of likely voters in Oregon support a proposal to tax, regulate and legalize marijuana for recreational use.\n\n**Maine**\n\nThe Marijuana Policy Project, a pro-pot advocacy group, has announced Maine as one of its top targets for legalization in upcoming election cycles. An initiative circulating through the state Legislature fell painfully short in a state House vote earlier this year, but MPP has announced plans to help coordinate a grassroots campaign to get a legalization measure on the ballot in 2016.\n\nMarijuana has been decriminalized and approved for medical use in Maine. According to a PPP poll released this week, 48 percent of registered voters in Maine believe pot should be legal for recreational use.\n\n**Massachusetts**\n\nThe deep-blue New England state is being eyed as a prime opportunity for legalization, with marijuana reform advocates pointing to high margins of support for previous pro-pot initiatives. No official campaign for a ballot initiative has been launched yet, though many predict it is only a matter of time.\n\nMassachusetts has decriminalized marijuana and just last November passed a ballot measure legalizing it for medical use. A February PPP poll found that 58 percent of the state's residents would be in favor of legalizing, taxing and regulating cannabis.\n\n**Montana**\n\nMontana has had a checkered history with marijuana laws. Voters passed an initiative legalizing cannabis for medical use in 2004, but opponents have since taken various steps to amend the measure or repeal it all together. Reform advocates remain hopeful that voters will support full legalization. They wasted no time following the 2012 election, filing a ballot question in hopes of putting the issue before voters in 2014.\n\nThere are no recent statewide surveys to gauge current support for pot legalization, though previous polls have showed a majority of Montana voters supporting the decriminalizing of marijuana.\n\n**Rhode Island**\n\nMarijuana advocates have high hopes that Rhode Island will be one of the first in the next round of states to legalize. This could come through a ballot initiative, but Rob Kampia, the executive director of MPP, recently said the issue could be ripe for state lawmakers to take on. While there's not yet a high-profile campaign to get legalization on an upcoming ballot, the state Legislature did consider a bill on the matter last session. While lawmakers debated the legislation and invited witnesses to testify on its merits, they never held a vote.\n\nRhode Island recently decriminalized marijuana and passed legalized medical marijuana around 2007. A PPP poll taken in January found that 52 percent of voters in the state support legalizing pot for recreational use.\n\n**Vermont**\n\nVermont has made strides to scale back marijuana prohibition over the past year, with a successful measure to decriminalize and a separate bill to establish a system of dispensaries for the state's medical cannabis patients. Observers see the state's strong support for the recent reelection of Gov. Peter Shumlin (D), an advocate for marijuana reform, as a sign that voters could get behind a ballot initiative to legalize. There is no large-scale effort toward this end yet, but a legalization bill was introduced in the state Legislature last session. It didn't receive a vote.\n\nPolls have consistently shown Vermonters to be supportive of efforts to scale back prohibition on marijuana.", "id": "t1_cdjjmve", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Xing_the_Rubicon", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1r4jdc", "id": "t1_cdjjn22", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cdjjmve", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428569504, "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdjjn22", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1385027102", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdjkcaz", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "lemontest", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cdjjmve", "score": 25, "retrieved_on": 1428569177, "controversiality": 0, "body": "You should credit [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/30/marijuana-legalization-states_n_3838866.html) for this list.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1r4jdc", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdjkcaz", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1385032110", "ups": 25, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1r4jdc", "selftext": "&gt; Massachusetts\n\nI live here.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1qr0jd", "selftext": "Strictly from a campaign and election strategy point of view, this is probably a poor way to go about things. \n\nWhen running for office, you need to focus on the issues that matter to voters. Voters are people that actually vote in elections. Issues that are most important to voters can differ from the issues that are most important to the general public. \n\nIn the upcoming 2014 elections, turnout will be between 25% and 50% depending on the state or district. A large portion of the population won't vote. You need to figure out who is likely to vote, and tailor your messaging to them. \n\nThe outright legalization of drugs does not have popular support among voters anywhere in the United States. There are just now a few polls that show voters favoring the legalization of marijuana for recreational use, but that's very different from making all drugs legal. If you make your proposal an all-drug-legalization package, you're going to lose significant support. It's better to go about it with an incremental approach - legalized marijuana first, because it's politically viable right now. Maybe somewhere down the road voters will feel the same way about cocaine, LSD, or some other drug, but it's not the way things are currently. \n\nPolling tells us that campaign finance reform is a more notable issue of concern to voters, but there isn't much consensus on how to reform the system. I can tell you with certainty that running on a platform that includes giving raises to elected officials will not be popular. Campaign finance reform can be a part of winning candidates platform, but it probably shouldn't be higher than their 4th or 5th overall issue.\n\nWithout question the most important issue to voters is the economy/employment. It's polled as the #1 issues for going on 7 years now. \n\nEverything you propose should tie back into improving the economy and creating jobs. \n\nYes, legalizing all drugs would create new jobs in the now-legal drug trade, but it's political suicide to say \"we're going to have less police offices\" ... it's even less believable all the cops are going to become grade school teachers.

Let's say our hypothetical McDonalds sells 2,000,000,000 a year netting them a turnover of $1,000,000,000 (on just the burgers, lets assume they only sell burgers!).\n\nIf you're saying Burger King also pays 50 cents a burger in terms of cost to buy and wages, and makes the same profit, let's assume Burger King also sells 2 billion burgers a year and makes 1 billion a year turnover.\n\nNow I'm the government and I have put a 10 cent burger tax on burgers. McDonalds have a choice of either reducing their margin by 10 cents a burger (costing the company $200,000,000) or you can pass on the cost to the consumer (costing them nothing).\n\nLet's assume McDoanlds passes on the cost. Now you as Burger King have two options:\n\n1) Copy McDonalds and pass on the cost (costing you nothing)\n2) Offer a lower price then McDonalds (costing you any where between $20,000,000 and $200,000,000 in your margins)\n\nNow your argument is you pick option 2 and charge $1.01 for a burger and laugh all the way to the bank as your extra customers will pay for the reduced margin. In order for you to do that, you'd have to sell and extra 352,941,177 burgers, or about 17.6% of McDonald's market share.\n\nLet me just say at this point, stealing 17.6% of another company's market share based on a 9 cent difference is pretty difficult.\n\nNow here's the biggest flaw in your logic. You know McDonalds has the same operating costs as you do, so if you DO manage to steal 17.6% of their market share, they can just drop their price to match yours and bring it back. Suddenly you've managed to destroy nearly $400,000,000 worth of value across the entire market.\n\nYou know from the start that you can't sustain your competitive advantage as McDoanlds will just copy you to avoid losing their market share, and then you both lose out.\n\nSo unless you know you can out price McDonalds no matter what, there is no long term benefit to reducing your price. Therefore you'll just increase your cost the same as McDoanlds, and consumers wont have a choice, you'll increase your profits and the government gets more tax money.\n\nThe only time you see companies competing on price is if they can gaurentee that they can out price and subsequently outlast their competition at a rock bottom price. \n\nIt is not in a company's interest to directly compete on price, it never is unless they know they have the lowest costs. Taxes on corporations are nearly always passed onto the consumer, and then eloquently avoided paying through tax loopholes anyway (it's in the news there is a 10p burger tax, so you put prices up by 10p, then use your accounts to only pay 5p of the 10p tax anyway, thus bagging a profit). Why did you think that big companies like Wal-Mart and McDonalds aren't constantly cutting their prices? *New entrants* compete on price because they have nothing to lose by devaluing the market.\n\nThat's not to say they don't have their uses though, in some cases you want them to pass cost onto the consumer in order to discourage consumers from buying the product in the first place (e.g. cigarettes) and other times it's simply the best political course of action to raise more tax money or take a stance on a particular issue. \n\n\n", "id": "t1_cdbouvy", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Kitchner", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cdbfqli", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428705786, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1qc72o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdbouvy", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384172575", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdbcuiy", "score": 5, "retrieved_on": 1428710112, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1qc72o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdbfqli", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384136201", "ups": 5, "distinguished": null}

There are pros and cons of both that approach and Obama's - the pro is that it does not impact baseline, the negative is that it's not in the number we both want to discuss.  Still, you can't point to that as the excuse as then we just shift to the total deficit, both on-and-off budget.  The analysis there is pretty much in line with what I did above.

If you look at [Table 2.1](http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/historicals) you'll see that the corporate income taxes nearly dropped by 65% from 2007 through 2009.  Individual income taxes dropped by 22% ($264 billion) but have since more or less recovered in 2012.  While it was a reason back then, the drop of income tax is no longer a source of the increased deficit.\n\n&gt;The ACA has not added a single net dollar to the deficit.... At this point, repealing the ACA would cost $200-$300 billion, which would of course increase our deficit.\n\nAnd as we get further out into full implementation, the cost of repeal will drop and drop as the current \"savings\" is estimated at [$138 billion](http://www.cbo.gov/publication/21327)... it was originally scored with more years of tax income than program expense.

At this point, repealing the ACA would cost $200-$300 billion, which would of course increase our deficit.\n\nThis is even more dishonest.  The ACA is projected to add 180 billion dollars of expenditure EVERY year it is in operation.  the estimates that it would lower the deficit were based on medicare cuts, a number of tax hikes, and the inclusion of extraneous programs that had nothing to do with the actual bill.  Of those, the medicare cuts almost certainly will not happen, a number of extraneous bits have been removed, and the parts of the bill that have gone into effect are already way over budget.  It is madness to assume that the rest will come in under budget.\n\nEven worse, there is simply nothing in the ACA that controls costs in any meaningful way.  It is a massive spending bill that will do nothing to control the increase of healthcare costs.

It's way too early to predict what messaging and/or attacks will be effective in that contest. \n\nThe 2014 midterms elections are closer, but still over a year away, and again, it's a bit too early to tell which message will be effective in the summer of 2014, when campaigns kick into high gear for the 2014 cycle. \n\nThe Republicans have fundamental advantages headed into 2014. The current House districts favor the GOP. The Democrats would need to net 17 seats to win control of the House. Maybe 30-40 House seats (out of 435) are competitive. Midterm voters tend to be more conservative, and thus lean Republican. For the Democrats to win back control of the House, they would really need to thread the needle. \n\nNow, the current polling shows that the plurality of registered voters believe the GOP is more to blame for the shutdown - by a 10%+ margin. This is a significant margin electorally, but we cannot assume that the same people who blame the GOP 10% more are the same people that will show up to vote in November 2014. In fact, it's unlikely that many of the people who do blame the GOP will actually vote in 2014. When it comes to showing up to vote, liberals/progressives/Democrats are less disciplined. \n\nIn the Senate, the map once again favors the Republicans. The Senate Democrats must defend 21 seats, whereas the GOP only defends 14 seats in 2014. \n\nWest Virginia and South Dakota are very likely to pick-ups for the Senate GOP. Further, the Democrats must defend Senate seats in Arkansas, Louisiana, North Carolina and Alaska, all states the Romney won in 2012. The only real pick-up opportunities for Senate Democrats are in Kentucky and Georgia, also both states Romney won, but the Democrats have strong, well-connected, female candidates running in both of those states, and the early polling shows they will be competitive races. \n\nThe gov't shutdown isn't helping anyone up for reelection in 2014. But if you're a challenger, and you can run as a D.C. \"outisder\" against an incumbent member of Congress, the gov't shutdown is probably helping your campaign right now ... but that doesn't mean it will be helpful 6 months or a year from now.

But partisans will blindly follow the policy preferences of the elites in their party (hence Republican voters who hate Obamacare even though they supported the same policy when Newt Gingrich proposed it in the 90s). When their party \"wins,\" they love it even if it wasn't bipartisan. When their party \"loses,\" they blame the other side for not being bipartisan enough.\n\nSome subset of voters know a lot about one or two policies that matter most to them (\"issue publics\"), and scholarly research has demonstrated that these voters participate disproportionately on those issues and contribute more to aggregate public opinion than anyone else. These are the voters who do have specific policy preferences.\n\nFinally, the least informed voters either don't participate at all or make choices seemingly randomly and therefore have no net effect on the aggregate signal (see *The Macro Polity*). They don't know much about policy outcomes, but they also don't have much effect on overall indicators of public opinion.\n\n&gt; The best indicator the public has that something is \"good policy\" is that both sides have agreed to it and support it.\n\nI strongly disagree. That indicates non-controversial policy, not good policy. Some of the most important policies in history (integrating schools, ending slavery, the New Deal, etc.) were highly controversial and partisan. Likewise, some of the worst policies were bipartisan (I would point to NCLB and the Iraq War in recent years).\n\n&gt; It's a hugely imperfect indicator (one that allows one party to sabotage the other by simply never allowing bipartisan compromise to occur... don't know who that would be) but I think it is one that is definitely relied upon heavily by the public.\n\nIt's not an \"I think\" question -- it's an empirical question, and there's simply not much evidence for it. Voters say they like bipartisanship, but bipartisanship *per se* has little effect on anybody's opinion. It's just that partisan voters follow the elites in their own party, so when both teams of elites are on the same side, both teams of voters are, too.

With a simple FAQ and sample election. Literally, sample elections or even 'do-over' elections from the past with the Approval Voting system. Maybe. A 2000 Do-Over may end up causing more harm than good.\n\nStep 2: Run local ads \"Tired of lesser-of-two-evils\" or \"Want more freedom in your elections?\" depending on the local character.\n\nStep 3a: Phone polls, with approval voting. \"Given the current list of candidates, which ones would you vote for? Select as many as you wish.\" \"Would you like a voting system that allows to vote for every candidate you like?\"\n\nStep 3b: Local ads explaining approval voting, and directing people to the website.\n\nStep 4: Local ads touting approval voting based on 3a and the actual results of elections.    \nDistricts with highly approved winner, highlight that it shows that person's approval.     \nDistricts with 'best available' winner, highlight that it shows there are other competitive candidates not available in the current system.     \nConservative districts, highlight democratic congresspersons that would have lost if the approval voting existed.     \nLiberal districts, same but against conservative congresspersons.      \nIndependent/purple districts, highlight districts with non-major-party players that would have won if not for the current system.\n\nStep 5: Post-election Approval Voting. Send out ballots (clearly marked as not official) as almost a do-over for the recent election. Especially for contentious elections. Tally the numbers. Make everything upfront and honest, especially with the numbers. (20% responded with these results ..., etc).\n\nStep 6: More ads, highlighting everything. The good. The bad. The ugly. Compare and contrast with the current system. Show the faults of the current system. Show the faults of Approval Voting. \"Tell you representative, whether you approve of them or not, what you think.\" Etc.\n\nStep 7: Change everything.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "No one is proposing \"opening the borders to mass immigration.\" \n\nThe current debate is about what to do with the legal immigrants that are already here - many of them have been here for decades. \n\nFurther, increasing (or even decreasing) border security is secondary in the immigration discussion, because more than half of all illegal immigrants in the US can here legally. For example, they have temporary work or travel visas, and then never left when they were supposed to. Additionally, the border is less important now, given that Mexico's economy has greatly improved in the last several decades and we now have net-negative immigration from Mexico - meaning we are deporting Mexicans faster than they are illegally entering the county. \n\n&gt;letting mass immigration will result in more optional segregation and increased racial tensions in the future.\n\nThe trend is the exact opposite. The more exposure people have to other races/cultures the less tension there is. The US is now the most ethnically diverse it has ever been, and there is less racial/ethnic tension than there has been at any point in our history. \n\n\n&gt; I believe that the best immigration policy to where we get educated people with work visas over here. \n\nThe work visa situation is two-tracked. \n\n1) low-skilled seasonal (farm) workers\n2) high-skilled workers\n\nVirtually every business in the county supports increasing the number of both types of visas and expediting the process. (there are many more types of visas, but I'm simplifying)\n\n\n&gt;My second contention is that it reduces the strength of unions, both because of more cheap labor but also because ethnically diverse workforces tend to produce weak unions.\n\nThis is entirely false. \n\n1) Unions support reasonable immigration reform. They know they cannot compete with illegal-immigrate wages, therefore their strategy involves providing work visas and a path to citizenship which would allow immigrants to become union members themselves. \n\n2) You clearly don't know shit about unions. The local union hall is more often than not the most ethnically diverse place in town. They don't care about race/religion/etc ... it's simply about labor -vs- management. Long before schools were integrated in this county, black and white unions members stood side-by-side.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1jzod1", "selftext": "National Party &gt; State Party &gt; Local Party \n\nThe Local party may be a County-level organization or a District-specific organization. \n\nUsing your example, the Indiana Republican Party is the primary political organization of Indiana Republicans.  Mike Pence, the governor of Indiana, is a Republican and he either chooses or strongly influences (rules vary by state) who serves as Chairman for the Republican Party of Indiana. It serves as his political operation - helping to promote his agenda, and ultimately to earn him reelection. The Republican Party of Indiana is also focuses on retaining and gaining legislative seats in the Indiana state House and Indiana state Senate.  If a state has partisan local elections, for example, mayor or sheriff, then the state parties would help with those campaigns as well. \n\nIt varies by state, but typically, each state party has a Chairman who is a figurehead/spokesman, and an Executive Director, who runs the day-to-day operations. There are also state-wide boards which provide oversight to the state party and steer the political agenda. People serving of these boards are typically elected at state party conventions. Again, it depends on the state and the party's own rules, but most of these boards have several dozen members. \n\nState political parties also play a role in US House and US Senate elections, however, the national party committees (RNC, NRSC, NRCC, DNC, DSCC, DCCC) play a more important role in federal elections. \n\nThe main National Party Organizations:\n\nDNC - Democratic National Party \n\nRNC - Republican National Party\n\nDSCC - Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee\n\nNRSC - National Republican Senatorial Committee \n\nDCCC - Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee \n\nNRCC - National Republican Congressional Committee \n\n[There is also the Democratic Governors Association and Republican Governors Association, but they operate as non-profits are are technically not national party committees, although they serve the same essential function]\n\n\nState parties also serve as important fundraising vehicles. For example, Mitch McConnell is running for reelection to the US Senate in Kentucky. You can only give his campaign $5,200... However, you can also give the Republican Party of Kentucky an additional $10,000 and they can in turn use that money to help McConnell. You can also give the NRSC up to $32,400 and they can use that money to help McConnell. You could also give the RNC another $32,400 and they can use that to help McConnell. \n\n\nFederal contribution limits: \n\nCandidate: $5,200\n\nState Party: $10,000\n\nNational Party: $32,400\n\n\nIt's also important to note that state-level parties have some degree autonomy. For example, the Democratic Party of Florida can make its own rules and run it's own operations without the DNC's input - however, it's often helpful to coordinate and cooperate. Other times, it's in the interests of the state-level party to distance themselves from the national party, for example, the Democratic Governor of Kentucky, Steve Beshear, is the leader of the Kentucky Democratic Party, and much of his reelection campaign in 2011 focused on how he disagreed with Obama, who is the leader of the DNC, because Obama is extremely unpopular in Kentucky.", "id": "t1_cbjwl35", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Xing_the_Rubicon", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1jzod1", "id": "t1_cbjye2i", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cbjwl35", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1429894486, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thank you for knowing things about parties!

What matters more than your positions is the sense that people are familiar with you, or more specifically, familiar with your name.  I assume you're relatively unknown in the district. You need to put your name in front of the people who vote in the primary elections. \n\nYou need to access the party's voter file. (They will give access to this database for all Democrats that pay the user fee). You need to find primary voters - preferably people that have voted in 2 of the last 3 primaries, or perhaps 3 out of the last 5 primaries. \n\nIf someone has never voted in a primary election (especially mid-term primaries), you should ignore them, because they aren't going to vote anyhow. \n\nYou need to be talking to people who always or almost always vote in primaries. \n\n5 of 5 primary voters should be the first people you target;\n4 of 5 primary voters second;\n3 of 5 primary voters third;\n\nand so on... \n\nYou need to formulate a plan to contact as many good primary voters as possible, and ask them for their vote. \n\nYou should be sending mail, making phone calls, and knocking on doors. \n\nYou need to track who has committed to supporting you (these are called \"1s\")\n\nYou need to track who is undecided (2)\n\nYou need to track who is supporting your opponents (3)\n\nYou should spend several months doing this. \n\nWhen people commit to voting for you, you should mark them down as a \"1\", and then circle back with them later and ask them if they would volunteer, donate, or maybe just host a yard sign. \n\nWhen people are undecided, you need to mail them more information about yourself and attempted to persuade them. \n\nWhen someone tells you they are supporting your opponent, you should thank them for their time and then ignore them - don't waste your time trying to persuade them. \n\nIt sounds like you aware what GOTV is, so you may know that 3 days before the election you need to call as many 1's as possible and remind them to vote for you.

It's way too complicated to explain to someone in the 20-30 seconds you have to persuade them. Imagine standing on a stranger's poach, you just interrupted them from their TV show, and now you're going to explain to them an entirely foreign concept that's based on a European model... you're going to lose the voter's interest quickly.\n\nI can't. No. Really, I can't.  Yes, it's a complicated issue.  But it's also the only reason I'm running and the only issue, really, that matters.  If I can get this passed, I'll never have to run for anything ever again because I know that I'll have a say in government as a voter. \n\nAlso, the model I'm suggesting is not European.  It's Australian, which I think may be a bit more palpable. \n\n&gt; Primary voters will almost certainly understand gerrymandering, and I would suggest you support a non-partisan citizen's redistricting committee.\n\nGerrymandering is only one - and the most obvious - of the problems with Single Member District (the current system.) \n\nRedistricting (partisan or not) *will not solve the problems inherent to the election system* so I do not support it.  Bipartisan redistricting would be a farce; it would be fair to the Republicans and Democrats, but not to the people of Texas who deserve the ability to have a real say in their government.   \n\nLook, I get it.  It's a complicated issue.  But I've spent the last ten years coming to the conclusion that the electoral system is the **primary cause** of most of the frustrations that people have in American politics.  Asking me to back off of this issue may be the \"pragmatic\" thing to do, and it may help get me elected.  But then I'd be just another Democrat, just another guy winning for the sake of winning. \n\nAll I know is that when I go to vote, it doesn't make any difference in the eventual policies that are enacted.  That's why I don't vote, that's why my friends don't vote. \n\nThat's all I want - is some sort of say in who represents me and how my government functions, which I don't have under the current system.

Indeed, in a direct comparison the US army is still more powerful than Chinas. But I think it is just not possible anymore for them to do whatever they want. The reason is - this \"they are the good guys\" bonus, originating in the US costly and heroic interventions end of WWII (and the fact that they were on the winner side), has been lost over the decades and now completely turned into the opposite. The mentioned invasions are not seen as success stories at all, they are seen as military disasters that destabilized countries and killed millions of civilians (if you dont know that - this is NOT cool). Just an overview:\n\n- Vietnam war - what was it good for? The world only remembers the US threw lots of napalm on small children\n- Afghanistan war - took ages, didnt reach its official goal to smash international terrorism, instead fueled it. World remembers - lots of war crimes, civilians get shot by drones\n- Iraq war - one of the biggest disasters in newer history. The country is in worse condition than before. Official goal isnt taken serious by anyone, instead the credibility of the US government and the reputation of the US are heavily damaged. World remembers - endless series of suicide bombings, war crimes, massacres.\n\nWhat these \"wars\" have in common is - they were not wars (except the first 3 weeks of Irak war). The enemy was no standing, trained army. You cant sell vietnam farmers some guns, then shoot them from safe helicopters and claim you had the right to go to the other side of the world and kill them because of that. I hope I dont have to mention all the proxy wars and the shady stuff the CIA did (e.g. installation of Saddam Hussein), now common knowledge.\nMaybe you do not take this image the USA has now very serious, but it will have detrimential long term effects. Education - when you have a look at the leading researchers, professors and postdocs in the US, you will see there is a majority of higher educated Europeans and Asians. Due to a rather inefficient school system, the USA depends heavily on an \"intelligence transfer\" from said continents. What if this transfer finally comes to an halt? Intelligent people can go where they want in the end. Economy - the backbone of nearly everything, here it is very important that the USD is trusted by the world in order to stay lead currency. After several crises originating in the US, the picture here also changed in the last years. Europe withdraws its gold reserves, while China gets rid of US bonds. Military - you can guess what happens to a large army, subjected to repeated budget cuts, when you look at the situation in post-sowjet countries. So to conclude, do you really think the US can get away with another war? Its not a matter of having enough guns, its a matter of financing it (doubtfully given at the current point), the likelihood to win it (we saw that the last conflicts against 2nd world-countries were not won anymore but failed), and the justifiability towards the rest of the world (absolutely not given anymore). I dont think anybody in power is interested in seeing this.

This always begins with stuff like hard work, economic rise, skilled diplomacy (~ USA long before WWI). A stable economy + open society attracted young, enthusiastic people and later leading scientists. Its difficult to exactly tell what caused what, so lets put it short - the USA created an upwards spiral.\n\nWhen one of these key features - open society, economic stability, image of the state to the outside and to the inside etc. - breaks away, then everything I just explained can reverse and a country falls behind other, stronger ones again, or in a worst case ends up in a downwards spiral.

Indeed, in a direct comparison the US army is still more powerful than Chinas. But I think it is just not possible anymore for them to do whatever they want. The reason is - this \"they are the good guys\" bonus, originating in the US costly and heroic interventions end of WWII (and the fact that they were on the winner side), has been lost over the decades and now completely turned into the opposite. The mentioned invasions are not seen as success stories at all, they are seen as military disasters that destabilized countries and killed millions of civilians (if you dont know that - this is NOT cool). Just an overview:\n\n- Vietnam war - what was it good for? The world only remembers the US threw lots of napalm on small children\n- Afghanistan war - took ages, didnt reach its official goal to smash international terrorism, instead fueled it. World remembers - lots of war crimes, civilians get shot by drones\n- Iraq war - one of the biggest disasters in newer history. The country is in worse condition than before. Official goal isnt taken serious by anyone, instead the credibility of the US government and the reputation of the US are heavily damaged. World remembers - endless series of suicide bombings, war crimes, massacres.\n\nWhat these \"wars\" have in common is - they were not wars (except the first 3 weeks of Irak war). The enemy was no standing, trained army. You cant sell vietnam farmers some guns, then shoot them from safe helicopters and claim you had the right to go to the other side of the world and kill them because of that. I hope I dont have to mention all the proxy wars and the shady stuff the CIA did (e.g. installation of Saddam Hussein), now common knowledge.\nMaybe you do not take this image the USA has now very serious, but it will have detrimential long term effects. Education - when you have a look at the leading researchers, professors and postdocs in the US, you will see there is a majority of higher educated Europeans and Asians. Due to a rather inefficient school system, the USA depends heavily on an \"intelligence transfer\" from said continents. What if this transfer finally comes to an halt? Intelligent people can go where they want in the end. Economy - the backbone of nearly everything, here it is very important that the USD is trusted by the world in order to stay lead currency. After several crises originating in the US, the picture here also changed in the last years. Europe withdraws its gold reserves, while China gets rid of US bonds. Military - you can guess what happens to a large army, subjected to repeated budget cuts, when you look at the situation in post-sowjet countries. So to conclude, do you really think the US can get away with another war? Its not a matter of having enough guns, its a matter of financing it (doubtfully given at the current point), the likelihood to win it (we saw that the last conflicts against 2nd world-countries were not won anymore but failed), and the justifiability towards the rest of the world (absolutely not given anymore). I dont think anybody in power is interested in seeing this. And concerning civil war - China is not close to one, there are only few internal tensions - while the situation in the US might be different - very imbalanced, asocial society structure, weapons freely available, racism, lots of religions.

Make no mistake, it is not in anyone's interest to have to deal with a country that is so destabilized and it's institutions so tattered that it requires a large degree of \"nation building\" to mend or repair the damage done. In the case of Syria, the United States and the West want a robust, capable Syria that first and foremost does not act as a conduit for Iran to funnel weapons/resources into Lebanon and Hezbollah, thus threatening Israel, a close ally. Secondly it is preferable that the installed government is strong and centralized enough to prevent such extremism from festering inside it's own borders. It is much better, and easier, to have a country that is fully functional and capable *and* accommodating to your interests than having to deal with a country that is full of extremists or a hostile regime. A country that functions well is a country that makes a good partner/asset. Now, if you can't get a partner country, or your partner country is in danger of being overthrown, how far are you willing to go to incur the negative effects of destabilization? By this, I mean how long do you want to keep funding the rebels and or the Syrian government while the country implodes in order to get an outcome that you desire? The Russian government has gone \"all in\" on the side of Assad, and middle-eastern powers such as Turkey and Saudi-Arabia are heavily funding the rebels. The West almost certainly also plays a part in things like intelligence and possibly limited training, but right now it seems the bulk of the rebels' support is coming from the anti-Iran bloc (Turkey, Saudi-Arabia, United Arab Emirates). \n\nThe U.S. wanted to get involved immediately in the beginning of the Syrian uprising, when the Assad government began killing protesters/demonstrators. A no-fly zone was offered up at the U.N. security council, which was vetoed by Russia (with China following their lead) for reasons I went through in my other post. This would have fit in with the Libya example. Get in quick with a light footprint, change regimes and hopefully replace with someone/something more in line with your own goals. Quick, easy, done. The veto turned this plan on it's head, and there has been little agreement as to what U.S. policy should be since then. It is now moving in the direction of arming the rebels, but the most capable and efficient rebels, Al-Nusra, are al-qaeda affiliates. So we run into a problem there too.

Also, much of what you have said is irrelevant to the conversation at hand, which is whether or not the US has good intentions when intervening. However, let's examine each of your claims.\n\nFirst, Africa. Far from being a \"tribal sewer,\" Africa was home to many great empires and civilizations before the interference of Western powers. \nFrom /u/danger0david who posted this answer in an /r/AskHistorians thread\n\n&gt;There were a few precolonial kingdoms in the Sahel that were pretty significant. The Kingdom of Ghana lasted from roughly 750-1076 AD, and although ethnically the kingdom was mostly the Soninke people, to some extent its culture was influenced by the Berbers. Next up is the Kingdom of Mali, which may be the most important of the precolonial kingdoms. It lasted from roughly 1230-1600, though the height of its power was in the 14th and 15th centuries. Comprised mostly of the Mandinka people, the Malian kingdom was larger than much of Europe. It was a commanding trade presence, and cities like Djenne and Timbuktu were hubs for Muslim scholarship.\nThe common factor for all these kingdoms is that they linked the gold trade of West Africa to the salt trade of Arab North Africa, and each was materially prosperous to differing degrees. There's a famous story (which may or may not be apocryphal) about Mansa Musa, ruler of Mali, who went on the Hajj and brought with him so much treasure that he single-handedly caused the value of gold to drop for a few years in Mediterranean Africa.\n\nHowever, European involvement served largely to rob Africa of many natural resources such as gold, diamonds, rubber, palm oil, HUMANS, etc. and Western powers *created* the racial tensions that plague Africa to this day, the most famous example being the Hutsi's and the Tutsi's in Rwanada who were a part of the same tribe before one was delegated as more important than the other in order to help the Western powers keep control, which was then the cause of the Rwandan genocide. The Western powers purposefully shaped a whole continent to be dependent on them and when they all pulled out acted surprised that everything fell to shit.\n\nAs far as the Middle East goes, what about Mesopotamia, the Persian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, the Egyptians and the list goes on. Guess who invented algebra? Guess who is largely responsible for the preservation of many Greek classics by translating them into Arabic? Guess where the cultural hub of the world was while Europe was going through the dark ages, where scientific advances were being made constantly? That's right, this pile of rock and sand and camels we call the Middle East, which was later ravaged by European powers during, before, and after the Cold War. Iran was a beautiful place. US intervention led to the revolution in 1979 which had led to an autocratic theocracy. Afghanistan was a beautiful place. Now, after British invasions, Russian invasions, and now US invasions, it is a war torn country in shambles. The Middle East was one of the most powerful regions in the world and only started declining in the 20th century, but apparently your history lessons did not go that far back.\n\nNow, what is the cause of Islamist violence? In Iraq, where most of this violence takes place, it was started by the removal of Sadaam Hussein, who although brutal was able to keep religious tensions in check. Except, it seems someone went and killed him and now the whole country is in turmoil. I wonder who is to blame. Another point of religious violence is Pakistan. I wonder who has been destabilizing this country for the past ten years by using drone strikes which have been undermining the Pakistani government's sovereignty and creating tensions amng all of the various tribes. Oh right, its the US. Of all the wars in the Middle East of the past 100 years, there is only 1 I can think of where the US was not directly involved, and even then they supplied **chemical weapons** to one side which were then used in the genocide of the Kurds.\n\nThe view point that the \"US didn't set the tables for any of this\" is largely ignorant to world history and shows a complete lack of understanding of the developments that have taken place in the world especially in the last two centuries. I strongly recommend you learn something about the history of these regions before designating them \"sewers\" or \"piles of sand\" because you are coming off as naive to the actual state of the world. The question is, where were the good intentions in any of this? I only see an imperialist nation seizing power where it can", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9hksxu", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366265055", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c9hk5ci", "parent_id": "t1_c9hjxmx", "score": -2, "retrieved_on": 1431516791, "controversiality": 0, "body": "if what you say is true, then why, pray tell, does pretty much every nation in trouble beg the US to intervene?  Why is it that Africa was a tribal sewer before Western involvement (the US wasn't really that big a factor there) and returned promptly to being an tribal sewer after the colonial powers left?  \n\nVietnam?  Vietnam was completely winnable and would have been far better off had the US won.  Why didn't we?  Because of the craven perfidy of LBJ and McNamary, among the two most evil leaders in US history.\n\nThe Middle East?  It was rocks, sand, and camels until the Western powers showed up.   Absent Western involvement it would still be so.   The entire Arab Penninsula produces almost nothing, creates almost nothing, and leaves almost nothing of value behind.  If you take oil out of the Arabic/Persian GDP, the entire region has a GDP the size of a small Scandinavian state like Denmark.  And the ONLY reason they have marketable oil is because of the West.  \n\nAnd then there is the murder and mayhem report.  Since 1948 well under 100,000 people have died in the various Israeli-Islamist conflicts.  That's all in, civilians and combatants.  In that same period of time, over 3 *million* Islamist around the world have killed ... each other.\n\nThe point is that the US didn't set the table for any of this.  It played the geopolitical cards it  was handed.  Sometimes not to well or too smartly but I mainain - mostly - with good intent.\n\nPersonally, I'd love to do the experiment of seeing the US entirely withdraw from the world stage, sell everyone ammo and watch the show.

My argument has been that US global positioning is a product of *pure* self interest, destabilizing countries, invading them, replacing governments, and painting some countries as evil to the international community whenever it serves them to.\n\nAs to whether or not the world owes freedom to the US, I think that is a bold claim. Is Iran better off after the US got involved to \"free\" them? How about Vietnam? Or Africa? Is the current situation in the Middle East not *caused* by the US, or at least a direct response to it?

It's pretty much true that most of the world that is free owes it generally to the Anglosphere and specifically to the US.

Many would claim that our presence in the Middle East is merely an elaborate scheme to gain more oil or at least to benefit certain US based oil companies such as Haliburton, [which is lent credence by the fact that oil exports from Iraq sharply increased after the US invasion] (http://www.indexmundi.com/energy.aspx?country=iq&amp;product=oil&amp;graph=production).\n\nThe argument that the US's intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan created a demand for democracy in the Middle East is shaky at best. First because it is yet to be seen the final outcome of the movements, as all 3 countries you listed are still in turmoil and have not been able to elect a stable government which they like. Secondly, many would argue that the impetus for these movements was *not* seeing the US's efforts in neighboring countries (which essentially established puppet regimes which is not what the protest movements seek) but rather a vast improvement in modes of communication which allowed for widespread rebellion in one country, which then became the catalyst for the rest of the Arab Spring.\n\nI would also disagree with your \"Axis of Evil\" argument. The quest for nukes is not necessarily a bad thing, its only a bad thing when it is done by the people that the US doesn't like. The US did not complain about Israel, India, or Pakistan gaining nuclear capabilities, and we did not invade any of these countries when they violated the NPT in order to gain these nuclear weapons, yet the US is staunchly against Iran and North Korea gaining these same capabilities, only because these countries defy US regional interests. The invasion of Iraq was based on a lie, something which no one denies, the only point of contention is whether or not it was known it was a lie before the invasion took place, which from my understanding is unclear. \n\nThe US seems to cherry pick which dictatorships are and are not acceptable based on whether or not they go along with the US, going so far as to overthrow certain governments, often democratically elected, and replace them with dictators or puppet regimes which then represent US interests (for example, Iran, Argentina, Chile, Vietnam etc.) This seems to support the argument that the US does **not** intervene based on spreading democracy or helping the oppressed, but rather to serve its own interests which often ends up involving the need for natural resources, which was reddititis' point", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9hjh54", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366260273", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "There is no evidence that Iran has made the decision to develop nuclear weapons.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1cji9i", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1cji9i", "selftext": "\"Kroenig argues that there is an urgent need to attack Iran's nuclear infrastructure soon, since Tehran could \"produce its first nuclear weapon within six months of deciding to do so.\" Yet that last phrase is crucial. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has documented Iranian efforts to achieve the capacity to develop nuclear weapons at some point, but there is no hard evidence that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has yet made the final decision to develop them. In arguing for a six-month horizon, Kroenig also misleadingly conflates hypothetical timelines to produce weapons-grade uranium with the time actually required to construct a bomb. According to 2010 Senate testimony by James Cartwright, then vice chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, and recent statements by the former heads of Israel's national intelligence and defense intelligence agencies, even if Iran could produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a bomb in six months, it would take it at least a year to produce a testable nuclear device and considerably longer to make a deliverable weapon. And David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security (and the source of Kroenig's six-month estimate), recently told Agence France-Presse that there is a \"low probability\" that the Iranians would actually develop a bomb over the next year even if they had the capability to do so. Because there is no evidence that Iran has built additional covert enrichment plants since the Natanz and Qom sites were outed in 2002 and 2009, respectively, any near-term move by Tehran to produce weapons-grade uranium would have to rely on its declared facilities. The IAEA would thus detect such activity with sufficient time for the international community to mount a forceful response. As a result, the Iranians are unlikely to commit to building nuclear weapons until they can do so much more quickly or out of sight, which could be years off.\" [Source](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137031/colin-h-kahl/not-time-to-attack-iran)", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9iv8a3", "parent_id": "t1_c9iq7sd", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431494177, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9iv8a3", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366425675", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c9iq7sd", "parent_id": "t1_c9ipydv", "score": -1, "retrieved_on": 1431496539, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Fingers in ears?", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9iq7sd", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366409957", "distinguished": null, "ups": -1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9ipydv", "parent_id": "t1_c9hiawu", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431496734, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1cji9i", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9ipydv", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366409201", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c9hiawu", "parent_id": "t1_c9hi4ow", "score": -1, "retrieved_on": 1431517661, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; he US's global presence is due to the need for rare earth minerals, oil, or other natural resources \n\nWell, then the government is doing a crap job, because these things are going up in price, not down.\n\n&gt; However, I'll leave it up to you to decide which explanation you find more convincing. \n\nI am a long time libertarian that was uncomfortable with Bush and cannot stand Obama.

Security teams will have advanced the trip and will have likely spent a week or more ahead of time in Hawaii securing the location; sweeping it for threats and then locking it down. You'll have executive staff members all advance the trip as well, and set up make-shift offices. All these people are going to be going on secure flights to and from, and they'll require secure locations once on sight. \n\nIt's not like the Obamas are going on vacation and easting lobster stuffed with caviar and wiping their mouths with diamonds. \n\nThe $1.4 billion number is false, and so is the claim that George W. Bush spent 1,000 days on vacation. Last year when Obama was in India, Fox News claimed that Obama's trip was costing $100,000,000 per day - which is ridiculous, and they later had to walk back the claim.
