{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1pfab9", "selftext": "Part of the argument is that the airwaves were public property, and could be given to the radio and TV broadcasters with certain restrictions. One of them is that the FCC could regulate profanity before 10pm with bleeps. \n\nOne reason this doesn't challenge the First Amendment is that use of the airwaves is regulated by a simple private contract that broadcasters have agreed to. This explains why cable channels don't have to bleep (although many do).\n\nThe other reason is that obscenity is not considered free speech. This is true in many countries, [including the US](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_obscenity_law). The Supreme Court has developed a framework to see if something is obscene or not, called the [Miller test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_Test). It must be offensive to the average person, it must be sexual in nature, and most importantly, it must *lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.* All three must be fulfilled for something to be called obscene. While obscenity is banned in any broadcast, including cable, not a whole lot of content falls under that category. Pornography, for instance, is famously regarded as not obscene in California.\n\nIf you're asking how it helps or damages, well, that's a very long discussion. The bleeping does very little damage, and I guess it can be convenient for parents to know that their children won't hear swearing on TV before a certain time. There are really no other benefits that I can think of.\n\nHowever, from a freedom of speech point of view, censorship can create something called a *chilling effect*. Imagine that everything you say at all times will be recorded and later played back to your mother. Would you say the same things to your friends at a bar or your wife at home if this were true? I doubt it.\n\nThat is what a *chilling effect* is. Censorship doesn't have to stop something from being broadcast to work. It can simply stop the content from being created in the first place because the creator is afraid of the consequences. That's a huge negative, depending on the severity of the censorship. I can't imagine the bleep contributing to a chilling effect of any importance, but harsher regulation of what is or isn't art certainly would.\n\n**TL;DR:** Things aren't bleeped because of direct censorship. As long as it's not broadcast over public airwaves, swearing is perfectly legal at any time on TV. Obscenity, which has a very narrow standard, is *not* allowed on broadcast anywhere, but few things are seen as obscene, even though there's no strict definition. A wider definition of obscenity might cause censorship through a *chilling effect*, which means that people don't create or speak because they are afraid of reprisals.", "id": "t1_cd1rzvm", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "ctolsen", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cd1u075", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Nickitydd", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1pfab9", "id": "t1_cd1w5hn", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "thedurka", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cd1u075", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428944811, "controversiality": 0, "body": "If you're interested in obscenity law in particular, you may enjoy both George Carlin's routine \"Seven Dirty Words You Can't Say On Television\" and the supreme court case that followed it's broadcast on a radio station, FCC Vs Pacifica Foundation.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd1w5hn", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1383019027", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cd1rzvm", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428945883, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Very informative!

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Corporate personhood is an oft misunderstood concept. Corporations aren't people. But they are, with some exceptions, treated as a gathering of people, pooling their resources and acting like one. As with a natural person, corporations can sue and be sued, enter into legally binding contracts, and in some cases even be convicted of crimes.\n\nAll this happens on behalf of those who have entered the corporation, and in essence, the personhood of a corporation is simply an extension of the individuals who take part in it, like /u/PoliSciUgGuy mentions. That could be interpreted as an opportunity to pool freedom of speech (which I think is reasonable \u2013 the issues in the US are of a cultural nature rather than legal). Fourth Amendment protections extend to the corporation too \u2013 evidence cannot be seized from a corporation simply because it's not personal property. \n\nThen we have *limited liability*. This means that the people who enter into a corporation are limited in loss of life and property to a certain extent, but it's not absolute. Limited liability means shareholders have no liability other than the money they invested. A bank can't get to the shareholders to collect debt. This drastically lowers the risk of investment.\n\nA corporation could not, however, be a pool of votes, other than the fact that the shareholders are of course free to discuss and agree upon what to vote in an election. Creating a vote for a corporation would not make it a pooling of resources, but a free-for-all *augmentation* of it[1]. And while you could imagine a corporation running for Congress, it would be an impossible construct as the corporation is responsible to shareholders, while elected officials are responsible to voters.\n\nCould all voters in a district get together, create a \"corporation\", vote on its policies and send that corporation to Congress with a representative of the company to meet in the House? Well, yes \u2013 the district is the corporation, the vote is called an election, and the executor a Congressperson. In some sense, voters enjoy limited liability from their representative \u2013 they vote for the guy and enjoy the fruits of their actions, but will not be legally responsible for their errors.\n\nHowever, not all rights are limited in a corporation. For a public company, a common shareholder wouldn't really have any liability other than the invested money (there would be no [mens rea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mens_rea)) for crimes, but the shield is weaker for directors, and they are often shareholders too. Directors are responsible for the corporation's good business practice, such as filing with authorities and keeping proper books, and can be criminally liable for the actions of the corporation, often through criminal negligence. Becoming a director is essentially saying \"You pay me, and I'll assume some of your liability.\"\n\nIf corporations were real people, bankruptcy would be murder. It's obviously not. \n\n1: In the City of London, companies actually [vote in local elections](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ROpIKZe-c), based on their number of employees.

The reason is because it's not a big part of the political culture and parties are mostly financed by the government and the party's holdings. Any donation, private or corporate, over NOK 20k (USD ~$3500) is public, the rest is private information. \n\nThe biggest receiver of private money, the Labour Party, received NOK 120 million from the government (national and local aggregated) in the last election year, 2011. Just over NOK 10 million was received from private donors, mostly unions. A little less was received from corporations and private individuals by the Conservative Party.\n\nI think it works very well. I get the impression that people buy into the politics that exist, and if you want to influence it, you need to do more than just pay up. Of course money will get you in the door but that doesn't equal corruption or influence. There are some concerns with Labour's strong ties to unions, which have deep structural roots in the party, but while I do agree there are issues (such as the only tangible tax cut given at the beginning of the current government was increasing a deduction for union membership) it's not like anyone should think that a Labour party wouldn't hand influence to unions.\n\nWe get the same conspiracy theories about politicians and positions as anyone else, but if our politicians are hungry for anything, it's power, not money. It's not a very good way to make a living, I'd say \u2013 very hard work for little pay. While I think private individuals should open their wallets a bit more under the tenets of \"put your money where your mouth is\", I'm quite happy with the state of money in politics in Norway.

These have responsibilities like primary health care, nursing homes, fire departments, some social security, kindergartens, and so on. I'll just say it this way: if you're a drug addict, or a person with a stigmatised disease, and you live in a small county, you're gonna have a bad time.

I really don't understand is why Democrats absolutely wanted to solve healthcare on a federal level. I think the states would be the best place for it, as concerns are different, and you get more competition between systems \u2013 Europe has everything from state-run-and-shut-out-private-suppliers single payer healthcare to basically government vouchers, and all of them generally provide quality care.

I'm not British, and although i live in London, I never grew up with Thatcher either as a leader or as a memory. I have some comments though.\n\nMy opinion is that she did not have a choice, but she could have done it differently. She was tougher than necessary, and towards the end I could honestly say I think she lost it a bit. It would be impossible to say if the things that brought her down would be good for the economy or tax morale or whatever, but I (look at my flair) can't ever understand why she didn't consider the political fallout of the poll tax, for instance.\n\nEconomically, she did manage to curtail inflation. That was the big one and nothing mattered more. It obviously follows [world trends](http://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/explore?ds=z8ehg1neoorltg_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=cpi_t1&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:OECD:NMEC&amp;idim=country:GBR:USA:FRA:DEU&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;ind=false), but if you compare pre-Thatcher with the early 90s, you'll see there's a larger difference. Growth was also generally lower than in comparable countries before she came along. Those two data points aren't really enough to paint the entire picture, but from what I've picked up through the years she did good on the economy. She increased interest rates and gave housing and rental some much needed deregulation, and the unions in the UK *did* have way too much power at the time. (But I'm not sure I'd want her there any longer than she was in office.)\n\nI get that people are angry though, but I don't get the immense hatred. People are saying lots of things in support of the miners she took jobs from, but when she took power, British Coal was losing half a billion pounds a year. Miners with *incredibly* strong unions were not the only lower class people in the country by far, but the rest of them had to foot the bill to keep them in their jobs. Is that fair?\n\nIf you want more on Thatcher, I thought The Economist had some excellent articles on her when she died.
