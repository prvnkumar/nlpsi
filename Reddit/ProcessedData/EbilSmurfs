It's no longer \"Company A got a bunch of money and asked for a job against company B and C\" as it currently happens. The move would instead set us back a bit and be \"Person A is in charge of finding companies for this and he only found Company A\". \n\nRemember that Lobbying is \"To see influence with a politician on an issue\". It's not necessarily a bad thing, I would hope politicians are lobbied by both sides of an issue they know nothing about. I think what you should really be discussing is if you think companies should make a profit on everything or we should just agree that there are some things that we would rather have the State take a loss on instead of operate at full capacity. Prisons are a great example where not having a full jail means it is more expensive per prisoner, but the societal benefit of not jailing people for minor offenses can out weigh the loss from not optimizing the prison.

Sounds like you are forcing people into a position that hurts their overall well being and then complain when they tell you they need help. \n\n &gt; Why? It would be far too easily to manipulate the system. If you were a married couple with children, this would become your \"unemployment insurance\", first of all. Fired from work?

This way they are only earning 17k for 12 years and 12k the rest. \n\n&gt; Those parents are not going to be developing the skills they will need to re-enter the workplace\n\nThis is a risk you take when you have kids and spend your time with them in an economy such as the US's.

However I am not, so I will just decline on saying anything other than \"This already happens, however now the parents would not have as hard of a life while they were raising their kids, so it is possible they took extra CC classes to stay up to date once their children were 15 or something.\n\n&gt; You're talking about child benefit payments.\n\nI am operating under the assumption that OP is discussing a form of this approach and does not know about it.

For example, we are getting to the point where we get maybe 5-10 watts of energy for every watt we use to get oil. Coal is more than twice that. If we were to start worrying about how much energy something uses we would change what is considered good for the economy. It also has the benefit of more clearly showing the effects of regulation. If adding a mercury scrubber to a coal plant reduces energy provide by half, it is probably better to use a cleaner form of energy. Since almost everything in the first world is heavily tied into energy, it is easy to carry over how each item costs. \n\nI can imagine that it would also increase investments into better energy production while decreasing the effect of Wallstreet and it's use of heavy gambling to make large amounts of money. Instead the best way to make money would be to create more energy efficient things. \n\nThis is a real simple view of an energy based economy, and I am not the person to give you a real in-depth pro/con argument. I also linked the Wiki because of the sources, the page itself is lacking badly.

There is no reason here why it's more important to use energy as a base rather than coal specifically, or corn or anything. \n\nAlso, energy is fairly arbitrary. Does the wealth of things now depend on how much energy can be made with them? How is that determined? \n\nThird, we do. Capitalism presupposes we care about how we use capital including energy producing commodities. To argue we don't literally destroys all foundations of capitalism. Unless you argue that the reason we don't care comes from some non free market influence, but if that's the case changing the monetary base wouldn't affect it.\n\n&gt;Since almost everything in the first world is heavily tied into energy, it is easy to carry over how each item costs.\n\nFirst, that's not true at all. How much energy did it take to get my t-shirt here to me? There are literally hundred page studies that have tried to answer that. It's not \"easy\" to see. If it was, again capitalism would be a useless. One of the fundamental arguments for capitalism is that we can't know prices. That's what the free market does. Society as a whole will always beat a few experts in determining prices. \n\nSecond, everything is tied to fiat cost. It's easier to see how costly something is relative to its inputs rather than to a third item. Think of how bartering evolved. Person A has cows. Person B has pigs. Person C has dogs. Person D has cats. Person A wants cats. Person D doesn't want cows but will take 2 pigs or 3 dogs. Now which is cheaper? I don't know. If there was a single currency, we could compare. Otherwise I would have to go to both places, haggle. And when there are not 4 items but thousands or millions, that all can be traded for anything it becomes really complicated. A single currency solves that. A theoretical idea of energy being related to all those? I don't know, how much energy does it take to raise a cow?\n\nNow I'll bring up a simple general argument for fiat currency. Its price can be made stable. A goal of currency is not to encourage investment in a certain area but to stabilize trade. Think about it. If on day one I find out dogs are cheaper and day two pigs are cheaper and it fluctuates, I'm not sure where to go. Now this trade can be made fast. But when I'm dealing with month long investments and trying to see if the net present value of it will be positive I want to have a relatively stable currency to deal with. Sure there are derivative markets to hedge my risk in many cases, but these markets are often illiquid and as a result I will pay a hefty fee to secure my profit. That's not an efficient marketplace.\n\n&gt;can imagine that it would also increase investments into better energy production\n\nNow I start to question what is this energy you speak of. If it's electricity or some relatively similar derivative, won't this mean we will just store excess of it? Also, while this is good, is it net good? Could that money have been spent better? You are literally artificially inflating the value of one part of the market, which is horrible since you now push resources into a place they are not being allocated the best.\n\n\"Instead the best way to make money would be to create more energy efficient things.\"\n\nThis has some really horrible implications.\n1. Let's say we can make energy a lot more efficiently. That causes a lot of price instability of everything AND guarantees hyperinflation.\n2. If this doesn't happen, we are now all scared. In fact this will greatly INCREASE the power of Wall Street (which I don't find terrible, but I'm sure you do) because of the excess use of the future and forwards markets. \n\n\"it's use of heavy gambling to make large amounts of money\"\n\nThis is just idle speculation, without understanding what actually happened at all. There is 0 reason to suspect this would happen, I would in fact argue the exact opposite would happen as you increase every company's risk.\n\nIn summation:\n1. Your argument presupposes capitalism is not a relatively good system of economics.\n2. Your system is arbitrarily defined.\n3. Your system would send us backwards hundreds if not thousands of years in economic advancement.\n\nPlease define what a dollar backed by energy is like. For example, a dollar backed by gold would mean every dollar I have is equal to some amount of gold. What exactly is energy in this case, how do I get it and are we really going to make the government store vast reserves of it?\n\nAlso a transitory period would be awful.\n\nIf you want to continue this conversation I would be more than happy to, if not have a good day.

In 2011, concealed carry permit holders were only convicted of [.2%](http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/RSD/CHL/Reports/ConvictionRatesReport2011.pdf) of the crimes.

Are you really the one to make the judgement call if the girl slipped on the top of the stairs, or if she jumped? Anti-Choice people like to pretend they have moral high ground, but few people want abortions to happen at all. Really what most anti-choice people do (from what I can tell), is decide that only certain types of abortions are OK, and babies only exist when they want them too. The Bible is a shitty source, as it clearly states in Genesis that life comes from breathing, you know, when God \"Breathed life into Adam and Eve\". Once you move off of that one literally, you have decided that everything in the Bible is figurative and it is no longer a source to be quoting from. \n\nI'm tired of my step-father using this argument against me, it is however why I know so much about that. In order to be logically consistent with \"a fetus is a child\" you have to accept that the abortion rate is then naturally at 70%, and if it's OK to kill 70%, then who do you punish there? If you don't punish anyone for 70%, then you are picking and choosing how to apply the law, and that's a different argument.

Unfortunately, however, confusion reigns regarding its advantages and disadvantages. IRV is very good at preventing minor parties from interfering with the two-party system, but it is arguably no better than our current plurality system at expanding the two-party system and giving other parties a chance to actually win elections. Furthermore, if a third party ever does become strong enough under IRV to seriously threaten the two major parties, they could hurt their own cause and wreak havoc with our entire political system, just as they could under our current plurality system.\nIRV can prevent the spoiler effect, in which a minor party splits the vote with a major party and tilts the election toward the other major party, hurting its own cause. IRV therefore seems to allow supporters of minor parties to cast protest votes without \"wasting\" their votes. This advantage is illusory, however, because it applies only as long as those minor parties are sure to lose. As soon as one of those minor parties threatens to become a major party and actually win, its supporters vote for them at the risk of hurting their own cause, just as in the current plurality system. Under IRV, votes for minor parties are therefore symbolic at best, or dangerous at worst. An example will illustrate why.\nSuppose my true preference is for the Libertarian first and the Republican second. Suppose further that the Libertarians are the strongest \"minor\" party. At some round of the IRV counting process, all the candidates will be eliminated except the Republican, the Democrat, and the Libertarian. If the Libertarian then has the fewest first-choice votes, he or she will be eliminated and my vote will transfer to the Republican, just as I wanted. But what if the Republican is eliminated before the Libertarian? Unless all the Republican votes transfer to the Libertarian, which is extremely unlikely, the Democrat might then beat the Libertarian. If so, I will have helped the Democrat win by not strategically ranking the Republican first.

Take a look at [American Samoa's unemployment rate](http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?c=aq&amp;v=74) and compare it to the time when Congress increased the minimum wage and the response (press releases) by the tuna firms.  \n\nCurrently the market rate for labor is around $5/hour but minimum wage is at $7.15, an increase will only increase the surplus of labor in the U.S. (surplus of labor = unemployment).  Ask anyone who runs a business, ask him what he would do if he had a surplus of product; would he raise his price of that product or reduce it...

But anyway - let's have some fun!  \n\n&gt;deaths related to work gone done (OSHA)\n\nActually - if you look at the number of deaths each year since 1900 to present, OSHA made no statistical difference... OSHA didn't save anyone, deaths are fewer because of improvements in technology and the increase in the cost of labor which ships the more dangerous jobs overseas.  OSHA is a waste of money.  \n\n&gt;Food is higher quality than it used to be (FDA),\n\nThe FDA actually kills tens of thousands of people every year by dragging its feet in approving certain drugs.  Furthermore, market signals do more to improve the quality of food than the FDA ever has.  The FDA doesn't do much to improve the quality of food at all... if you buy food from a place and it sucks, you go on facebook and say so; you go to the BBB and complain, you tell your friends and family about that food provider and none of you go back to that place or you protest out front of that store/restaurant - that firm goes out of business and the next firm knows better.  \n\n&gt;We have gone into fucking space (NASA)\n\nYes, NASA is publicly funded, but look at Virgin Galactic.  \n\n&gt;The Free Market failed miserably to solve any of these things on their own\n\nAgain, you wrongly assume that we have ever had a free market in this country... As soon as the Constitution was signed the government started interfering with the markets... we've never had a free market so everything you base upon that flawed premise is invalid.  \n\n&gt;You're having a laugh now.\n\nNo, I'm not.  Grab any intro to economics book and it will prove to you that minimum wage must necessarily increase unemployment.  If the market price is the same as the minimum wage (Australia) then it wont; but that rarely happens.  Take a look at [American Samoa's unemployment rate](http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?c=aq&amp;v=74) and compare it to the time when Congress increased the minimum wage and the response (press releases) by the tuna firms.  \n\nCurrently the market rate for labor is around $5/hour but minimum wage is at $7.15, an increase will only increase the surplus of labor in the U.S. (surplus of labor = unemployment).  Ask anyone who runs a business, ask him what he would do if he had a surplus of product; would he raise his price of that product or reduce it... Labor market works just the same.  \n\nPlease feel free to get an intro to econ text book, it appears it will greatly help you.  \n\nAnd ease off of the ad homs, you're just demonstrating your lack of ability to have a reasoned debate.

They have perhaps the largest form of government possible: dictatorial warlords.  It is closer to a feudal government.  \n\nBut anyway - let us try to get a couple important distinctions down first.  There is a difference between the government and the economy.  When I say that I want a free market - I am not talking about an anarchy - please keep that distinction in mind.   \n\nSo whenever we need to talk about a complete society, there are at least 2 (and possibly a third for social interface) terms to consider: The form of economy and the form of government (to be further clear, you can talk about authoritarian, totalitarian, or some other interface between the government and social interactions).  \n\nSo for me, I want the smallest government possible and no government involvement in the economy.  That means I am a minarchist and a capitalist respectively.  \n\n&gt;The Free Market is responsible for things like the Ohio river being set ablaze before the EPA came around.\n\nActually, this was because of government favoritism.  Keep in mind that the free market was also responsible for cars which eliminated perhaps the most extremely high polluting form of transportation ever: Horses.  Imagine 10 million horses in the New York City area producing tons of manure.  The free market replaced that horrendous level of pollution.  \n\n&gt;Anarchism is what happens when you take the Government away\n\n[Really?](http://allthingsd.com/files/2012/07/You-Dont-Say.jpg)\n\nBut not everyone who recognizes the historical truth that our government has grown well beyond its original design is an anarchist.  Thus this is nothing but a strawman argument.  \n\n&gt;and if you honestly think the richest could keep the vast amount of wealth they have accrued without a government to secure it for them you are insane.\n\nCool ad hom, bro.  If you think that the government hasn't been instrumental in creating the current wealth disparity, then you haven't studied American history.  A recent example: the PPACA was written by insurance companies and insurance companies are going to make a lot of money off of it.  \n\nAlso, programs such as the minimum wage has reduced the number of jobs available which has augmented the wealth disparity more than any other program.  \n\n&gt;It's naive and short sighted to pretend no government intervention at all is a good thing.\n\nAnd I never suggested as such.

This would mean he was following the will of the people in that area.\n\nIt's a federal issue, and an international issue. The majority of the country was *for* it. So was Canada. He based his objections on unfounded environmental concerns in the Ogallala Aquifer, which we currently frack in without issue.\n\nYour defense is logically fallacious in a federal system. We didn't care what the locals thought about de-segregation, poll taxes, or gun laws either. International business deals are the EXCLUSIVE domain of the federal government as outlined in the US Constitution's Article II section 3. He horribly bungled this one and created a market distortion.\n\n&gt; even the new Healthcare Act is a net positive for small businesses.\n\nyou just went full retard. Deliberately adding new fees and filing requirements in no way helps small businesses. Neither does raising marginal tax rates.\n\n&gt; Never heard about the Boeing issue, but a cursory glance says that the NLRB is calling him out as the first and only real pro-worker thing I've even heard of him doing.\n\nBoeing chose to build a plant in S.Carolina to oversee the production of the new 787. Its order books are full for the next two years and it needs to catch up. When the details were released, the union in Washington went crazy and called it union-busting. Boeing wasn't even trying to outsource jobs, it simply wanted to create new ones in an area of the country where they could get a positive return. The lower cost-of-living in SC means that Boeing can afford to pay less even *before* union demands are taken into account. Of course, he scuttled it.\n\n&gt; Everything FactCheck.org has to show about it says he has reduced their financial burden. Would be nice if you could actually cite something.\n\n[Because FactCheck can be trusted....the lies they've accused Romney of have panned out to be true.](http://www.ijreview.com/2013/01/31131-politifacts-lie-of-the-year-about-romney-is-proven-true/)", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c89oy32", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1360066130", "ups": -1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c89n12c", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431197476, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c89ot5j", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1360064973", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c896w4f", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431196650, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; Obama is HARDLY a Leftist.
