I mean, they're obviously still around, but they've lost their leverage. The Republican Party was bullied into towing the Tea Party line and they lost.  You can especially see this with Boehner and his recent willingness to compromise with Democrats. Tea Party Republicans like Ted Cruz threatened to strip him of his Speaker position, so he gave in to them on the shutdown. But Republicans \"lost\", and Boehner is no willing to take the political blows he took over the shutdown. Republicans managed to bounce back quickly because of the healthcare.gov scandals, but the Tea Party still lost its credibility.\n\nI think a lot of Republicans are realizing that if they continue to pander to the Tea Party they may not fair well in the next election. Particularly, I don't think they want the 2016 Republican primary to end up an absolute joke like the 2012 primary. That means distancing themselves from people like Bachmann and Perry and embracing moderate Republican politicians like Chris Christie (assuming he makes it through the investigations he's under). \n\nIn my opinion, if the Republican Party wants to survive, it needs to turn away from the no compromise attitude of the Tea Party, as well as move towards the center on social issues like gay marriage and immigration. That's a move that also won't sit well with the Tea Party or the Republican voter base, but it's almost necessary at this point in my opinion.\n\nThis next midterm election and the next general election will very likely be important determiners of the longevity of the Tea Party.", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "ttoasty", "id": "t1_cfdm2kf", "parent_id": "t3_1xpf92", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1432367576, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cfdm2kf", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1392230116", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}

There's also quite a bit in the same wikipedia article that indicates Gaddafi was oppressive.  He banned political parties, set up surveillance committees that used 10-20% of the population to root out political dissent, the exec positions in the GPC were chosen by the revolutionary leadership, the revolutionary leadership had absolute veto despite the Constitutional boundaries, the military was under direct control of the presidency with no defense ministry, private press was censored, and Gaddafi regularly silenced and put down political dissenters and opposition.\n\n\nI really, really, really don't see how you think videos of Gaddafi's speeches or explanations of the Green Book prove **anything** regarding how good of a leader he was, other than he knew how to propagandize.\n\n\n[here's](http://feb17.info/news/myths-of-the-gaddafi-regime-explained/) a link that debunks most of the bullshit listed in your \"list of good things\".

China has heavily invested in US debt and rakes in trillions a year in USD due to the trade imbalance.

Instead, it proposes a type of direct democracy overseen by the General People's Committee which allow direct political participation for all adult citizens.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Green_Book_(Libya))\n\nIf you look into wiki of the [Politics of Gaddafi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Libya_under_Muammar_Gaddafi) itself, you will see a lot of good he has done, like:\n&gt;During his rule, Gaddafi took increasing control of the government, but he also attempted to achieve greater popular participation in local government. In 1973, he announced the start of a \"cultural revolution\" in schools, businesses, industries, and public institutions to oversee administration of those organizations in the public interest. The March 1977 establishment of \"people's power\" \u2014with mandatory popular participation in the selection of representatives to the GPC\u2014 was the culmination of this process.\n\nI just gave you wiki since its general ideas about it. Now let's look into actual things happening in Libya and from Gaddafi himself.\n\n[Here is one video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7rfEhtspC8) you should watch to understand what is going on. \n\nYou could also watch plenty of speeches given by Gaddafi that completely supports his ideas present in the Green Book. Especially listen to the one he gave in Tripoli or this [one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKMyY2V0J0Y). \n\nI could give you a mountain of proofs but its all there on youtube as videos, and things like this [list of good things he did to the people of Libya](http://expertscolumn.com/content/list-good-things-muammar-gaddafi-done-people-libya). \n\nSo yeah we just still painted him as terrible leader, when he was far from it. Of course he isn't exactly a saint either but he was definitely not a tyrant. That was just propaganda that we all just took in as the truth. \n\nSo now the question is... why did they target Gaddafi? Why did they want to get rid of him? [My guess is that it has to do with his golden currency](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLJu0X14vmg) which was a direct threat to the US petrodollar. \n\nAlso this is lot like the case with Saddam too but that was more justifiable because he wasn't a good person but then again, considering how problematic the politics there has become, he was probably a great leader for them.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1c5nto", "selftext": "Well, that's a billion dollar question.  There's no correct or easy answer.\n\nThere's many different ways to approach it.  One way is to ship shitloads of food grown in developed nations to countries where food supplies are short.  This is what the U.S. currently does.  The US government buys up extra grain to artificially inflate grain prices here at home (part of their subsidies), then pays to ship it to another country.  Farmers benefit, shipping companies benefit, and (very arguably) the receiving countries benefit.\n\nThe problem with this model is that it wastes money to ship grain halfway across the world, doesn't increase the capabilities of farmers in the receiving countries and harms local economies in those countries.  Often times, the grain doesn't even make it into the country before rotting, due to corrupt government officials and politics.\n\nBecause of this, the Obama administration is looking to move away from this model in favor of buying the food aid within the countries it donates too, much to the outrage of companies profiting off the current model.\n\nThis strategy has problems, too, though.  Buying the food in country will drive up food costs for those not receiving donated food.  There's also all sorts of infrastructure problems that can muck up this model, such as the difficulty of getting that much food to a market where it can be distributed (many times, this is a large contributor to food shortages in the first place).  It's overall a step in the right direction, though, because it boosts rather than harms the agricultural sectors of these countries, puts money directly into the hands of farmers, has a higher efficacy for the money spent, and decreases the amount of involvement the governments have in the whole process.\n\n\nOf course, giving food to these countries isn't the only way of going about it all, it's just the easiest.  The other way is to develop the agricultural capabilities of the country, as well as the infrastructure needed to get the food to markets or ports.  This is a lot more difficult and a **lot** more political.  Everyone has an opinion on economic development and how it should be done.  The past 60 years is littered with examples of how *not* to go about development, with only a few positive examples that basically got lucky (South Korea, being a good example of the latter).\n\n\nEven with the ideological battles aside, the actual ground work is just as difficult.  You may think the best route is to do what America and Europe does: big ass farms loosely or wholly controlled by a single entity (individual, company, coop, etc.) using the latest and greatest in farming equipment.  There's loads of examples of that failing in the past, typically leaving countries broke.  Maybe the answer is to continue with the traditional farming culture already present in most of these countries and just support and boost it when you can.  This will inevitably result in less output, though very likely enough output.  The problem is, it only takes one year of drought or poor weather to cause food shortages and panic.  One year of drought, and the farmer doesn't have the crops to feed his family *and* sell for supplemental money.  The farmers are forced to sell their farms or even lose them to banks.  Like I said, most methods that have been tried thus far have failed.\n\n\nThis isn't even touching on the political side of things.  There's a strong, if not prevailing, belief in the development/humanitarian/human rights fields that famine is not caused by actual food shortages but by politics.  There's a lot of evidence to support this idea, too.  Developing nations often lack the institutions, educated policymakers and bureaucrats, economic freedom, etc., to allow for a quick government reaction to food shortages.  Throw in corrupt officials and incompetent/uncaring authoritarian leaders, and you end up with a famine as a result of even minor food shortages.  You'd be surprised how much could be done towards ending global hunger just by straightening out governments.  There's a lot of simplification there, though, because often times efforts to spur development and growth cause these shortages and inhibitors of government reaction to begin with.\n\n\nFinally comes the question, is it even our place to try to solve these problems.  Modern day white man's burden, though it's not called that any more.  We've replaced the term with others, such as \"Universal Human Rights.\"  This idea that everyone has certain inalienable rights, such as a right to food, and that it is the obligation of humanity (read: developed, capable nations) to see that everyone has unfettered access to these rights.  Often times, though, this means that **we** decide the problems of others, **we** decide how to fix it, **we** do all the work, and **they** suffer when it inevitably fails.  It's a tragedy that plays out again and again and again, and has been since the end of WWII.  There's many who feel that all our prying into developing nations impedes their development.  Moyo, an economist and writer on the topic of African development aid that everyone loves to hate, feels very strongly this way and has a following ranging from economists to development experts to Oprah herself.  It's overall a tough question with a lot of moral and ethical implications.  Are we helping these countries and people on their quest for self-determination, are we deciding their path for them, or, possibly even worse, are we impeding their progress forward?\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nI could go on, but this is already pretty long.  Please keep in mind that this is a pretty shallow overview of all of the topics covered here.
