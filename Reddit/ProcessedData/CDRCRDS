Of course, their opinions are unfounded, both in terms of research and logic, but it might be worth looking at why they even think of such things regularly. There are multiple motivations for this train of thought but, there are a few that are common:\n\n* Many conspiracists are poorly educated and thus have a poor understanding how international policy works. They see the UN and the EU and assume these are attempts to take over their countries rather than help them improve.\n* Conspiracists have a high tendency to believe more conspiracist beliefs than just the first one that draws them into this ideology, and they snowball from there (the more they believe, the more new ones they accept). This is because they are searching desperately for evidence for what they believe, and since they can't find legit evidence, they simply use other conspiracist beliefs in place of it (which satisfies their want for personal justification, but fails to justify their beliefs on an academically-sound level). Thus, because other conspiracists believe a one world government is a problem, they go along with that train of thought.\n* Many conspiracists are racists. The KKK, neo-nazis, and other hate groups use conspiracism (*Protocols of the Elders of Zion*, Holocaust denial, etc) as a justification for racism. Others are not openly racist, but use conspiracism as a cover for their beliefs. A one world government is likely to not be controlled by them (as they don't control the UN, EU, or any other body they think will bring it about), so they fear that other races will have just as much if not more power than them.\n\nNow this does not necessarily explain why one world government would be bad, but it does explain why it is considered bad by those who most often express a negative opinion of it.", "id": "t1_cd636wn", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "miguk", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Interesting.

Theories such as Realism/Neorealism, Neoliberal institutionalism/liberalism, the English school all use a framework of international anarchy as our global political climate. Realism/Neorealism is one of the most popular way of thought right now, even though there are very many other that you could argue for as well.  \n\nUsing realism, we can analyze what a state is and wants.  Realism basically says that a state works off of power politics and absolute gains.  It also bases itself around balancing of power.  With these ideas, individual states would be extremely unwilling to give up their individual power and leverage to any other form of government.  With realism, it focuses on survival of the power of the state, a world government threatens the power the states has.\n\nWith a more detailed approach, we can look at the English School.  In an anarchic international setting, like the one that currently exists, there is no organizing government shaping or pressuring how states act with one another.  The issue would not be why it would be considered a bad thing, it's more of a question of how do you expect that to ever happen.  The closest thing to a \"World government\" would be what the English School of IR theory describes as the world society, which is one of the three perspectives of the English School, and it currently doesn't exist.  The other two perspectives being international system (which is the anarchical framework I was describing before, think realism) and the international society (which is a more constructivist view with cooperation through international organizations that set global social norms and laws).  The international system is the closest thing we have to a global government that exists, because many countries look to the UN for core values, norms, and international law.  Unfortunately it's still completely up to the state whether they want to play in the this international society, and can fall back under the international system of anarchy when it's convenient for the state.\n\nThat's where the world society comes into play.  The world society sets up a framework for more individual perspective  that can work by feedback from between the state and the international level.  This would be the the way you could possibly set up a universal government, but it hasn't happened yet, nor may it ever happen.  For the most part, the world society doesn't exist, only in a theoretical form does it take for and shape.  \n\nMy conclusion is that main international relation theory, which most nations follow, doesn't really allow it in any way.  Some people postulate that it might work if our world were ever placed against an unified threat against the entire world, which is extremely unlikely at the moment, and probably will never happen.  It's not necessarily a bad idea, it just is really impossible for it to happen.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ptz7k", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd6cot9", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1383548731", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ptz7k", "id": "t1_cd6ejbh", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ptz7k", "id": "t1_cd6g4g7", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Maticus", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cd6ejbh", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1428796327, "controversiality": 0, "body": "My IQ level dropped as a result of reading this.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd6g4g7", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1383571408", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t3_1ptz7k", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1428797066, "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd6ejbh", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1383561096", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ptz7k", "id": "t1_cd6iyoj", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Justinw303", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1ptz7k", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428795000, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Because government planning and intervention is already terrible enough.

I've been as many canadians have been voting on the charactee of personality as much as for ideology.\nFederal Elections:\nOnce for Liberals once for greens\nProvincially once for NDP Once for Conservative\nMunicipal\nTwice for a populous as a rejection to the hamd picked estanlishment candidates.\n\nRight now I peecieve the state of afdairs is best described as tentative. Things are good economically for Canada. Although major issues are occuring provincially. ONTARIO. A once rich manufacturing hib has shed its workforce and replaced it with low wage service jobs. It pays better to be an entrepeneur bit that's a 60hr a week job unless you inherit your assets.\nThe conservatives have been hurt by an ethics scandal that is in all actuallity indicative of the problem with our Senate. Our senate has served as a way to pay patronage to friends and party hacks. Harper the cyrrent Conservative prime minister promised to reform it so there is an election instead of an appointment made by the PM. Unfortunately once he got power he just stacked the senate with his appointments to undermine the liberals years of stacking the senate with their represantatives and forgot that altogether.\n3 of the people he chose were audited and shown to have spent a quedtionabke amount of tax payer money for flights hotels and dinners. The worst one Pamela Wallin doesn't even think she did anything wrong because when you're a senator in Canada you do treat yourself to tax payer money. What she doesn't realize however Is that for a long time now Canadians demand a fiscally conservative approach to government.  To avoid any further scandal he ordered the three perpetrators of waste to pay back about 500 000 dollars combined. They have done so but claim they did no wrong and are harming the party due to the perception that they are insolent and self entitled white rich wasps, evwn though one of them is part aboriginal.\n\nJustin trudeau has the attention of generation X. They want to do right by their parents and support Trudeau's son merely out of nostalgia. TRUDEAU the father had vision and defined the baby boomer generation. Whether people liked him or hated him the consensus was that he did what was best for the country all of the time. His son is just as debonaire however he is mired by the way the Liberal party has run itself into national insignificance. While the era of Chretien was a great and popular time for the liberals this decade has been wasted on a lack of leadership. Influential players are back stabbed and their centrist approach is undermined by the paternal way the Conservative party has used Harpers soft spoken father knows best demeaner. Liberal scandals have also made canadians consider the NDP or social democrats. Especially in Quebec where the seperatist party is finally seen as a party that can't deliver since their seperatist cause also means they won't run candidates in other parts of canada. The social democrats share some platforms with them and have siphoned support away from both the bloc and the liberals. The late Jack Layton also in his bid for the prime ministership led the Social democrats to become the official opposition. His legacy is one that proves Canadians want a sincere vision that includes the environment and the maintnance of its insitutions like healthcare. Unlike Justin Trudeau who is in bed with Big Oil and can't sincerely differentiate a platform that Is different than Stephen Harpers thw social democrats have succeeded in doing so.\n\nIf Justin can't be taken seriously when campaigning really ramps up and the Harper Conservatives can't shake anymore scandals then the NDP (Social democrats) are poised to win a minority government and win the prime ministership for the first time ever.\n\nThere have been NDP governments in the peovinces before. However some have been good and some have been bad. The one In Ontario left a legacy that wasted a generation of jobs and gave the impression that they are not concerned with accounting.\n\nThe Current NDP leader Mulcair is paternal but at least seems to understand that although its good to talk about environmentalism and the plight of those who have needs, it is also important to have an economic plan and considering Jack Laytons legacy Mulcair has not tried to emulate him. Instead he is less flamboyent and more steadfast. A real contrast to Trudeau. But at least Canadians seem to believe green jobs and protecting natural resources is in the long term interest for Canadians and higher paying jobs are in trying to build a specialized workforce that can work in the jobs that refine resources and build infrastructure. \n\nHarper Conservatives and Liberals still want to run Canada like Its 1985. But neo Liberalism is dead.\n\nSocial democrats have an environmental vision and want to give more money to the provinces. They also say they not only want to reform the senate but they want to abolish it. The latter Is unclear to me.\n\n\nSo that's it. You have the key names in here so you can read up on them using the google.\n\nPersonally I'm too young to care about Trudeauism. I liked Chretien who was the protoge of PierreTrudeau. But he had his own identity and surgical political savvy. He kept his party in check like a totalitarian dictator but expressed himself with candor to the canadian people. He would defeat his enemies through kindness. It was very machavelian and this shrewdness was important once the war drums were beating for an incursion in Iraq from George W. In the U.S\nJustin Trudeau shouldn't be under estimated however his commitment to politics doesn't come across like its about doing right by Canadians but rather because his celebrity could save the Liberals from the political wilderness. However I don't think he can accomplish this with centrism or being in bed with big oil. People will just trust Harper because he's at least shown that depspite the way he panders to his base, socially, things like gay marriage, abortion, marijuana smoking and injection sites are accepted as having a place in Canada. Liberals ca no longer use the aspect of repealing social progress to hurt the Conservatives politically. Their claims haven't come true. The only thing that remains toa attack Harper is that he loves digging for oil and selling off land to foreign companies. This does create jobs but in contrast Canada doesnt reap the benefits like refining oil might. Digging for resources doesn't get you as much money and it can have devastating impacts on the environment.\n\nTl:dr a diatribe outlining the state of Canadian affairs.

To be honest though, you will see references to Friedman and Chile everywhere when reading about neoliberalism.  They certainly appear in David Harvey's book.\n\nAs for what cassander said: it's a valid criticism of the book.  Naomi Klein tries to fit everything into an over-arching meta-narrative which causes her to lose sight of some of the facts, either through exaggeration or oversimplification to fit her theory.  I wouldn't say that you shouldn't read the book as a result, just that you should read it critically.  It does have some very good information, just so long as you can separate it from the conspiracy theories.  ([Here is a useful review of it](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/21/AR2007112101919.html)).\n\nIf you are going to read only one book from the opposition to neoliberalism, the David Harvey book is probably more useful; it is more factually sound.  A Brief History of Neoliberalism is a really good book.  However, if you could read both, I found Naomi Klein's book equally useful in terms of setting out the dimensions of the debate.

Police must be undermined and challenged to embarrass their leadership, to cause resignations. The leadership, the brass of the police are in all likelihood not part of the %99. Especially if you are top brass in a large city like Toronto, or Chicago. The brass at the police level have a vested interest to collude with politicians that sell out the interest of the public at large to the banks that concentrate wealth among themselves. In North America banks buy politicians and the police brass are merely politicians themselves.\nIn Mexico drug lords have to buy off police chiefs to assert their power. They target leaders who command the loyalty of their sub ordinates. The same thing happens here except as I said the violence which the police represents is monopolized through the economic power that our Governments command. They tolerate an extended level of crime that is limited to race, economic class and gender. There are a lot more poor ass pot heads in jail over rich ones. Poor people pay up the ass in interest and fees while wealthy individuals avoid transaction costs. But I digress.\n\nMy idea is to reinstititute the aspect of decentralized civil upheavel directed at the polices leadership. This means disseminating information about wealth and income within the ranks of the top brass. People must be prepared to resist the might of front line riot police over sitting in one contained area. This means Occupy needs to gain control of Government needs non violently but quickly. Not marches but actual over running of ministry offices. City hall and police stations. Casualties will be sustained but the leadership will be embarrassed. It will garner the attention from the oppressives and the media. They will call out against occupy for being aggressive but then non academic leadership within the ranks can with conviction declare that occupy is only asserting their interests in a non violent manner to reveal that politicians are the same at any level. Occupy can only establish credibility and legitamacy by revealing its oppressors for what they really are. Banks should have been occupied not parks. Thats already paid for by the publics money. Banks being occupied would have sent the message that the bailouts were the peoples money and the banks are being sustained by public money. The %99 leadership was too idealistic and didnt recognize that non violent civil disobediance can only be succesful if it embarrases its opponents.

While I remain of the view that the action you describe would have been disastrous for Occupy, it's interesting to hear the other side. \n\nThe reason incidentally I think it would have been disastrous is a read-across from their occupation of St Pauls Cathedral in London, which locally did them no favours as that was technically private property (even though the bishop of St Paul's let them stay) and there's a long history of suspicion of this who occupy someone else's private property among the general public in the UK (my assertion). There would have been a great deal of sympathy in the UK at least with the landlords of any mall or law firm that called in the police or a private security firm to kick the protesters out. The parallels with the quasi-anarchist May Day protests in London that for many years entailed an annual smashing up of the financial district in London would have been too close to ignore, and those are firmly entrenched in the British public's mind as a bunch of jobless losers smashing things up because they have no support of the general public (not saying that's a true description, just the perception).\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_15tzmv", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7q7c3d", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357199169", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c7pxe84", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1430837012, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7pyd6c", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357167285", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}

It is the representation of absolute power. Police must be undermined and challenged to embarrass their leadership, to cause resignations. The leadership, the brass of the police are in all likelihood not part of the %99. Especially if you are top brass in a large city like Toronto, or Chicago. The brass at the police level have a vested interest to collude with politicians that sell out the interest of the public at large to the banks that concentrate wealth among themselves. In North America banks buy politicians and the police brass are merely politicians themselves.\nIn Mexico drug lords have to buy off police chiefs to assert their power. They target leaders who command the loyalty of their sub ordinates. The same thing happens here except as I said the violence which the police represents is monopolized through the economic power that our Governments command. They tolerate an extended level of crime that is limited to race, economic class and gender. There are a lot more poor ass pot heads in jail over rich ones. Poor people pay up the ass in interest and fees while wealthy individuals avoid transaction costs. But I digress.\n\nMy idea is to reinstititute the aspect of decentralized civil upheavel directed at the polices leadership. This means disseminating information about wealth and income within the ranks of the top brass. People must be prepared to resist the might of front line riot police over sitting in one contained area. This means Occupy needs to gain control of Government needs non violently but quickly. Not marches but actual over running of ministry offices. City hall and police stations. Casualties will be sustained but the leadership will be embarrassed. It will garner the attention from the oppressives and the media. They will call out against occupy for being aggressive but then non academic leadership within the ranks can with conviction declare that occupy is only asserting their interests in a non violent manner to reveal that politicians are the same at any level. Occupy can only establish credibility and legitamacy by revealing its oppressors for what they really are. Banks should have been occupied not parks. Thats already paid for by the publics money. Banks being occupied would have sent the message that the bailouts were the peoples money and the banks are being sustained by public money. The %99 leadership was too idealistic and didnt recognize that non violent civil disobediance can only be succesful if it embarrases its opponents.
