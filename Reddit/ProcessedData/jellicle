Considering both of those are now limited to 20% of premiums via the PPACA (if the insurance company pays out less than 80% of medical claims, they had to refund it).  Here's a [summary](http://www.naic.org/state_report_cards/report_card_us.pdf) that down on the last page has the amount of premiums collected in the US by type.  Total premiums were ~$547 billion, so the savings would be $110 billion annually, assuming that no insurance company had more than 80% claims payout and there are no additional costs to maintaining the single-payer system.  Considering there's roughly [317 million Americans](http://www.census.gov/popclock/) that's a savings of $350 per person.  You'd also get some marginal savings elsewhere by ending the VA/TriCare/Medicaid and other state programs, but I would assume savings there would be offset by increased admin costs for Medicare.  But for the sake of argument, lets say its another $50 billion or roughly another $150 per person.  Even at $160 billion (heck, lets say $40 billion more for a nice round $200 billion), that's really not much considering US healthcare spending in upwards of [$2.6 trillion](https://www.medmutual.com/~/media/Files/Miscellaneous%20MedMutualcom%20PDFs/U%20S%20%20Healthcare%20Costs%20Report_rvsd%20092413.ashx).

If we have, we've got even greater expenses.  I would say that the other option is to cut reimbursements, but that'd be a death knell to the provider-side of the industry, as we hear that every time the [DocFix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_Sustainable_Growth_Rate) renewal comes up.

Yes, this might result in cheaper care for when that condition is detected as in its \"bad\" stage compared to its \"you're a goner\" stage, but you're also now going to be paying for those who would have gone undetected, where before they would have just died (worst case).  In the short-run, you'll see higher costs as everyone gets tested.  In the middle run is when you expect to see savings.

The huge difference is mostly to do with economy of scale and difference of bargaining power of a giant entity like the German state on the one hand, versus small to sort-of-large insurance companies in the US on the other. Governments can [artificially] increase the competitiveness of these sorts of industries.

Most care in most places with universal care is provided \"privately\" - the doctor is working for a private corporation or herself, not for the government.  Any qualified doctor can put out a shingle and open up a practice, etc. etc.\n\nBut there are some restrictions.  For instance, in Ontario, you can't charge more than the provincial health insurer would reimburse for any service that is covered.  So let's suppose putting on a bandaid gets reimbursed $1.  No doctor is permitted to charge more than that for putting on a bandaid.  (In practice, no doctor charges LESS than that, so all prices are identical...).  Any doc you see will get reimbursed $1 for that.  This eliminates any incentive to have special private healthcare plans for the rich.  They aren't specifically forbidden, but the doctors can't make any more money at them, so they're effectively discouraged.\n\nWithout that prohibition, you'd end up with the situation like in the U.S., where 50% of doctors are treating 5% of the population and 50% of the doctors are treating the other 95% of the population.  This assures worse healthcare for that 95% of the population (and better, but very expensive healthcare, for that rich 5%).  Canada has made the policy choice to provide good healthcare for everyone instead of just the richest 5%.\n\n[For services that aren't covered by the provincial healthcare plan, perhaps something like elective plastic surgery (facelifts), doctors are permitted to charge any amount they wish.]\n\nHope this clarifies.\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1umpl0", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "OHIP updates the amounts they pay for various procedures every year.

It chose not to, so citizens who'd lose coverage through CoverTN can now buy coverage from Healthcare.gov instead.\n\nSome citizens will lose benefits because they would be covered by the Medicaid expansion, which Tennessee is rejecting.\n\nEveryone else is unaffected. Everyone else gets better plans at better rates.\n\nThe only people who are affected are the people who would qualify for expanded Medicaid but won't get it because Tennessee won't take the money.\n\n&gt; I may misunderstand though, and it seems unlikely that you really support what it seems that you do. \n\nThank you.

If you're making $15k, you are not middle class.\n2. People were saying for years that housing looked like a bubble.  Even if you bought a house on a 30-year note, the only reason that payment wouldn't be what you can't handle is either you overbought or you had a change in employment.  Either of those would still be valid whether the bottom fell out or not.  Unless you mean borrowing on equity to finance living... which is an altogether other stupid idea.\n3.

The trick is knowing how money works and realizing what \"luxuries\" you're considering necessities.\n\nI completely agree with you when it comes to the middle class. I was mostly trying to explain why we keep hearing about so many people doing so poorly for income reasons. Many of them are just over spending like the $250k household and misinterpreting it but there are also many people trying to scrape by on $15k/year minimum wage jobs that were once exclusive to 2nd income workers(stay at home moms with day jobs), college students, and teenagers. Now there are families who have 2 workers making that much and we are hearing a lot from them and the people who notice the problem. People are seeing that problem and then noticing that other people are having a hard time getting by like the overspenders in the middle class and they are combining them assuming income is the only problem. \n\nWe need to look at it as 2 major problems. The lower class got stuck in the sand and didn't get income increases like the middle and upper classes did during the economic boom. We also have a large number of people who overcommitted themselves spending wise and bought houses and cars they could only afford if everything went perfect with no reasonable safety net of their own. Now I'm not suggesting that the government jump in and bail them out and I'm not suggesting forced raises is the answer for the other problem but we do need to look at the problem as 2 separate real issues with how things currently are.

It's almost as if one's political beliefs determined the argument, and not any actual economics.\n\nYou're confusing the situations.\n\nOne of the basic economic laws is the law of supply.  If the price of something increases, all things being equal, more of it will be produced and supplied.  We see this often on the consumption side of things, most often in the agricultural industry.  If the price of soybeans surge for some reason, more farmers will plant soybeans.  But the labor market is almost backwards than the consumption market - the supplier of labor are workers and the \"price\" is wages/salary.\n\nLook at it this way - say the wage for all teachers went from the $60k to $180k.  Current teachers would not work for less and no one else would fill those positions for less (for whatever reason, unions, employee preferences, etc).  You would expect a lot more people to apply to become teachers (the amount would be determined by elasticity).  People might like being an accountant making $75k, but if they could go and *teach* accounting, they'd make over double what they did before.  The same goes with CEO pay - the more money you offer, the more attractive your company is to recruiting a CEO.  (This is also closer to a monoposy market where there are few seller and lots of buyers, especially at the highest levels of business, which also bends some of the traditional rules.)\n\nNow when we pair this with the law of demand (as the price of a thing raises, less will be demanded).  While the salary for that teacher is $180k, but a lot fewer teachers would be employed - remember, all other things being equal.  Teachers that remain would be making 3x as much, but there would be 1/3 fewer teachers.  (In reality it wouldn't be so cut and dried as there are other demands that we're not factoring in, such as class size restrictions or preferences, etc).\n\nNow how does this play into the minimum wage?  Everyone is being forced up to $7.25 if their normal wages were lower.  That means Mr 18 who has no experience and no skills is going to be happy he got $7.25 instead of the $4 he would have bargained on his own.  Mr 30 is going to be happy he gets $7.25 instead of the $7 he would have earned.  There's the law of supply.  But now look at it from the employer - the law of demand - who would you rather hire if you can't hire both, based on what they can command absent minimum wage?  You're going to take Mr 30 as he has more skills.  That means Mr 18 is not going to have a job - or at least until his competition thins.  Eventually he'll be only competing against Mr 16 and Ms 17 in his market and he'll be the smart choice. \n\nMr 30 is better off compared to what he would have been before ($0.25 an hour), but Mr 18 is much worse off ($-4/hr).  But say the employer could afford $11 an hour in wages.  He could have hired both people and while Mr. 30 would have been worst off (-$0.25/hr) Mr 18 is much better off ($4/hr).  When looked in total, *everyone* is better off without the minimum wage (or at least set at $5.50 in this case).  An Individuals might be worse off, but the whole is better off.\n\nAnd that's the trick - balancing individuals versus the whole.  Sure, those fast food workers who keep their jobs at $15 an hour would be much better off.  But it is foolish to think that there would not be huge reductions in staff if that happened.  What about those people who are harmed?  The entire minimum wage argument turns the traditional Republican/Democrat talking points on its head.

What the minimum wage does, in this case, is prevent price competition at the low-end of the labor market.  And yes, that will have an impact on youth unemployment.  For example, in the [UK the youth unemployment rate (age 16-24) was 21.4%](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=6&amp;ved=0CFIQFjAF&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.parliament.uk%2Fbriefing-papers%2Fsn05871.pdf&amp;ei=3LEUUpm3IqeS2AWroIDYBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFHB8YCUji6z3sc1lXfn4hOTJwnDA&amp;sig2=G58LQYXpgOKjv6HS-6FYrw&amp;bvm=bv.50952593,d.b2I).  Germany's the bright spot for youth, compared to [France and Italy](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jul/01/europe-steps-tackle-youth-unemployment), but [they also have a very different model (one I think we should adopt)](http://www.npr.org/2012/04/04/149927290/the-secret-to-germanys-low-youth-unemployment)", "id": "t1_cbs8fzz", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "AuditorTux", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "And yet Canada's youth unemployment rate is 14% while its minimum wage is 50% higher than in the U.S.\n\nYou know your argument is exactly opposite to the standard one: pay people more and they'll have more incentive to seek work.\n\nWhy is it that we have to pay poor people LESS in order for them to seek work, but we have to pay rich people MORE to incentivize them?

It's almost as if one's political beliefs determined the argument, and not any actual economics.\n\nYou're confusing the situations.\n\nOne of the basic economic laws is the law of supply.  If the price of something increases, all things being equal, more of it will be produced and supplied.  We see this often on the consumption side of things, most often in the agricultural industry.  If the price of soybeans surge for some reason, more farmers will plant soybeans.  But the labor market is almost backwards than the consumption market - the supplier of labor are workers and the \"price\" is wages/salary.\n\nLook at it this way - say the wage for all teachers went from the $60k to $180k.  Current teachers would not work for less and no one else would fill those positions for less (for whatever reason, unions, employee preferences, etc).  You would expect a lot more people to apply to become teachers (the amount would be determined by elasticity).  People might like being an accountant making $75k, but if they could go and *teach* accounting, they'd make over double what they did before.  The same goes with CEO pay - the more money you offer, the more attractive your company is to recruiting a CEO.  (This is also closer to a monoposy market where there are few seller and lots of buyers, especially at the highest levels of business, which also bends some of the traditional rules.)\n\nNow when we pair this with the law of demand (as the price of a thing raises, less will be demanded).  While the salary for that teacher is $180k, but a lot fewer teachers would be employed - remember, all other things being equal.  Teachers that remain would be making 3x as much, but there would be 1/3 fewer teachers.  (In reality it wouldn't be so cut and dried as there are other demands that we're not factoring in, such as class size restrictions or preferences, etc).\n\nNow how does this play into the minimum wage?  Everyone is being forced up to $7.25 if their normal wages were lower.  That means Mr 18 who has no experience and no skills is going to be happy he got $7.25 instead of the $4 he would have bargained on his own.  Mr 30 is going to be happy he gets $7.25 instead of the $7 he would have earned.  There's the law of supply.  But now look at it from the employer - the law of demand - who would you rather hire if you can't hire both, based on what they can command absent minimum wage?  You're going to take Mr 30 as he has more skills.  That means Mr 18 is not going to have a job - or at least until his competition thins.  Eventually he'll be only competing against Mr 16 and Ms 17 in his market and he'll be the smart choice. \n\nMr 30 is better off compared to what he would have been before ($0.25 an hour), but Mr 18 is much worse off ($-4/hr).  But say the employer could afford $11 an hour in wages.  He could have hired both people and while Mr. 30 would have been worst off (-$0.25/hr) Mr 18 is much better off ($4/hr).  When looked in total, *everyone* is better off without the minimum wage (or at least set at $5.50 in this case).  An Individuals might be worse off, but the whole is better off.\n\nAnd that's the trick - balancing individuals versus the whole.  Sure, those fast food workers who keep their jobs at $15 an hour would be much better off.  But it is foolish to think that there would not be huge reductions in staff if that happened.  What about those people who are harmed?  The entire minimum wage argument turns the traditional Republican/Democrat talking points on its head.  Republicans end up defending the whole, Democrats the individual.", "id": "t1_cbs99i3", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "AuditorTux", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cbs8oa7", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1429752630, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "green", "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1kr25c", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cbs99i3", "author_flair_text": "[CPA][Libertarian]", "created_utc": "1377091760", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cbs8fzz", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429752905, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1kr25c", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cbs8oa7", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1377089428", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cbrxpfg", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429753012, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "green", "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1kr25c", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cbs8fzz", "author_flair_text": "[CPA][Libertarian]", "created_utc": "1377088390", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cbrrkue", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429758168, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cbrxpfg", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1377043875", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

This drives up returns for the money they have lent out to others.  The \"gold standard\" is effectively synonymous with this.  Today we call it \"tightening at the Fed\", when the Fed raises interest rates and reduces the amount of money circulating.\n\nThe poor/middle class/debtor class should always be (but often isn't, because they don't understand) in favor of loose money.  This benefits people who have borrowed money and who have little money owned - which is most people.  This used to be called things like \"free silver\", but today is generally called \"loosening at the Fed\", or lowering the Fed interest rate.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_silver\n\nThe battle between these two factions has been going on forever.  \"Tight money\" benefits the rich but tends to screw up the whole economy, because the poor don't have enough cash on hand to buy anything.  Loose money benefits the poor and reduces the gap between rich and poor.  Generally most world economies oscillate between \"too tight\" and \"just about right\".  \"Too loose\" is rarely seen in practice since, after all, the rich are generally running things.\n\nWe see this in practice today with the policy of \"austerity\" being conducted in many first-world nations today.

Then there is another, smaller party that gets 16% of the vote. In this case, the smaller party then is the decisive element for one side or the other to get control -- giving it, it would seem, undue influence.\n\nHowever, in countries that do have proportional representation that allows for multiple parties to spring up, there are usually multiple minority parties, decreasing the chance that any one minority party would actually have decisive power in this way.\n\nLet me give you an example. In Sweden, there are two large blocs of parties. Each is, in fact, led by a party that in the last election garned almost exactly 30% of the vote each: the Social Democrats on the left, and the Moderates on the right. There are six other parties that are over the threshold for representation (5%), who got between 5.6% and 7.3% in the last election. Five of the parties are in coalition with one or the other of the larger parties, while one is \"independent\" (although in reality being kept at arm's length because it's very controversial). \n\nThe result of a political landscape like this is not that one of the minority parties gets undue power -- if one tries to force a larger party into certain actions, they can turn towards the other parties.

I'm not for Voter ID without these means to mitigate these issues.\n\n&gt;The difference of course, is that the voter fraud they are trying to prohibit was never a problem in the first place.\n\nCan you provide evidence that people have never tried to vote under someone's name?  It nearly happened to [Eric Holder](http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/04/09/okeefes-video-on-eric-holders-ballot-still-not/185858), although O'Keefe stopped the attempt so he wouldn't actually break the law (since he was filming it).\n\nFurther from that link, it states that voter fraud occurs in 0.00004% of the time.  But while that sounds small, mulitiply that by 100 million and that's 4,000 instances every national election.  The other estimate from Washington was it was 0.0009.  That's 90,000 illegal votes.\n\nSeems to me that if you can manage to get IDs out to those who don't have them - which they need to fully participate in the modern world to begin with - having a control against fraud is a no-brainer.", "id": "t1_capy50m", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "AuditorTux", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1h1ej6", "id": "t1_capymw5", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "cattailboner", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1h1ej6", "selftext": "&gt;I'm saying it's not a systemic problem.

Can we use that for other legal issues - what about financial fraud?  I mean, its only 0.0009%...  Either you put controls in place to prevent fraud or you do not.  As an auditor and CPA, I tend to favor putting controls in place (which is why the TSA drives me nuts because they went the other extreme).\n\n&gt;Is this some make-believe voter ID law you're talking about? In the real world, the voter ID laws do not set up any apparatus to seek out and give IDs to poor people.\n\nMany Voter ID laws give away free, qualifying IDs.  Not sure how much more you can do... but if a law doesn't include that, I'd be opposed to it.\n\n&gt;Anyways, why don't you question the increasing need to provide ID for nearly everything? Your label says libertarian, but in what sense is a requisite citizen ID part of a smaller government?\n\nOne of the key parts of most beliefs is that you don't want to allow someone to harm another, whether libertarian or communist.  If my bank didn't require an ID, someone could walk in and clean out my account.  I'm not just going to rely on the social contract to prevent that.  Now the bank can provide their own issued IDs (some do) or we could consolidate and have the government issue an ID that could take their place.  I'm not one of the crazy anarchists that want to the government to do absolutely nothing.  But what it does do should be done well and efficiently.  This is one of those cases you can make the argument (economies of scale).\n\n&gt;Again, it seems like you are just making shit up as you go. That would be nice, to allow any form of ID on the form count as valid ID (although you should note that one of the forms of ID is a voter registration card, which makes this proposal moot), but most voter ID laws have very narrow definitions of what constitutes valid voter ID.\n\nPick a state's IDs allowed - your choice - and we'll compare it to the I-9's allowable forms of ID.\n\n&gt;Again, I thought we were talking about the actual voter ID laws, not AuditorTux's ideas of perfect voter ID laws.\n\nAnd on your case you're perfect voter ID law is none whatosever.  If we could craft a law that does not discriminate (offers free IDs) and offers a control, why not?

Anyway, yes, statistically speaking that is acceptable, and I don't think that's a controversial statement in the slightest. And it's one thing to try to completely eradicate cheating, but these laws have other consequences. There are all sorts of articles, feel free to google it, that try to figure out how many legal citizens these laws might prevent from voting. They run the gamut, but I [think this article from ProPublica](http://www.propublica.org/article/everything-youve-ever-wanted-to-know-about-voter-id-laws) is pretty good:\n\n&gt; How many voters might be turned away or dissuaded by the laws, and could they really affect the election?\n\n&gt;It's not clear.\n\n&gt;According to the Brennan Center, about 11 percent of U.S. citizens, or roughly 21 million citizens, don't have government-issued photo ID. This figure doesn't represent all voters likely to vote, just those eligible to vote.\n\n&gt;In late September, an analysis by Reuters and research firm Ipsos of data culled from 20,000 voter interviews found that those lacking proper ID were less likely to vote anyway, \u201cregardless of state law changes.\u201d\n\n&gt;Among those who said they were \u201ccertain to vote,\u201d only 1 percent said they did not have proper ID while another 1 percent said they were uncertain whether they had the proper ID.\n\n&gt;The analysis also found that those who lack valid photo ID tended to be young people, those without college educations, Hispanics and the poor.\n\n&gt;State figures also can be hard to nail down. In Pennsylvania, nearly 760,000 registered voters, or 9.2 percent of the state's 8.2 million voter base, don't own state-issued ID cards, according to an analysis of state records by the Philadelphia Inquirer. State officials, on the other hand, place this number at between 80,000 and 90,000.\n\n&gt;In Indiana and Georgia, states with the earliest versions of photo ID laws, about 1,300 provisional votes were discarded in the 2008 general election, later analysis has revealed.\n\n&gt;As for the potential effect on the election, one analysis by Nate Silver at the New York Times' FiveThirtyEight blog estimates they could decrease voter turnout anywhere between 0.8 and 2.4 percent. It doesn't sound like a very wide margin, but it all depends on the electoral landscape.\n\n&gt;\"We don't know exactly how much these news laws will affect turnout or skew turnout in favor of Republicans,\" said Hasen, author of the recently released The Voting Wars: From Florida 2000 to the Next Election Meltdown. \"But there's no question that in a very close election, they could be enough to make a difference in the outcome.\" \n\nNeedless to say, there really is no consensus, but by whatever measurement, I think at the very least, the net result of these voter ID laws is probably a wash; even the smaller estimates are around that same 90,000 figure you give.\n\n[Here's a segment from Democracy Now!](http://www.democracynow.org/2008/1/10/supreme_court_considers_voter_id_law) from 2008 that says basically the same stuff that I've already said.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1h1ej6", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_caq8h65", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1372206026", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_capymw5", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430687920, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "green", "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_capytcr", "author_flair_text": "[CPA][Libertarian]", "created_utc": "1372180507", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_capy50m", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1430688004, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm saying it's not a systemic problem.

Can we use that for other legal issues - what about financial fraud?  I mean, its only 0.0009%...  Either you put controls in place to prevent fraud or you do not.  As an auditor and CPA, I tend to favor putting controls in place (which is why the TSA drives me nuts because they went the other extreme).\n\n&gt;Is this some make-believe voter ID law you're talking about? In the real world, the voter ID laws do not set up any apparatus to seek out and give IDs to poor people.\n\nMany Voter ID laws give away free, qualifying IDs.  Not sure how much more you can do... but if a law doesn't include that, I'd be opposed to it.\n\n&gt;Anyways, why don't you question the increasing need to provide ID for nearly everything? Your label says libertarian, but in what sense is a requisite citizen ID part of a smaller government?\n\nOne of the key parts of most beliefs is that you don't want to allow someone to harm another, whether libertarian or communist.  If my bank didn't require an ID, someone could walk in and clean out my account.  I'm not just going to rely on the social contract to prevent that.  Now the bank can provide their own issued IDs (some do) or we could consolidate and have the government issue an ID that could take their place.  I'm not one of the crazy anarchists that want to the government to do absolutely nothing.  But what it does do should be done well and efficiently.  This is one of those cases you can make the argument (economies of scale).\n\n&gt;Again, it seems like you are just making shit up as you go. That would be nice, to allow any form of ID on the form count as valid ID (although you should note that one of the forms of ID is a voter registration card, which makes this proposal moot), but most voter ID laws have very narrow definitions of what constitutes valid voter ID.\n\nPick a state's IDs allowed - your choice - and we'll compare it to the I-9's allowable forms of ID.\n\n&gt;Again, I thought we were talking about the actual voter ID laws, not AuditorTux's ideas of perfect voter ID laws.\n\nAnd on your case you're perfect voter ID law is none whatosever.

Anyway, yes, statistically speaking that is acceptable, and I don't think that's a controversial statement in the slightest. And it's one thing to try to completely eradicate cheating, but these laws have other consequences. There are all sorts of articles, feel free to google it, that try to figure out how many legal citizens these laws might prevent from voting. They run the gamut, but I [think this article from ProPublica](http://www.propublica.org/article/everything-youve-ever-wanted-to-know-about-voter-id-laws) is pretty good:\n\n&gt; How many voters might be turned away or dissuaded by the laws, and could they really affect the election?\n\n&gt;It's not clear.\n\n&gt;According to the Brennan Center, about 11 percent of U.S. citizens, or roughly 21 million citizens, don't have government-issued photo ID. This figure doesn't represent all voters likely to vote, just those eligible to vote.\n\n&gt;In late September, an analysis by Reuters and research firm Ipsos of data culled from 20,000 voter interviews found that those lacking proper ID were less likely to vote anyway, \u201cregardless of state law changes.\u201d\n\n&gt;Among those who said they were \u201ccertain to vote,\u201d only 1 percent said they did not have proper ID while another 1 percent said they were uncertain whether they had the proper ID.\n\n&gt;The analysis also found that those who lack valid photo ID tended to be young people, those without college educations, Hispanics and the poor.\n\n&gt;State figures also can be hard to nail down. In Pennsylvania, nearly 760,000 registered voters, or 9.2 percent of the state's 8.2 million voter base, don't own state-issued ID cards, according to an analysis of state records by the Philadelphia Inquirer. State officials, on the other hand, place this number at between 80,000 and 90,000.\n\n&gt;In Indiana and Georgia, states with the earliest versions of photo ID laws, about 1,300 provisional votes were discarded in the 2008 general election, later analysis has revealed.\n\n&gt;As for the potential effect on the election, one analysis by Nate Silver at the New York Times' FiveThirtyEight blog estimates they could decrease voter turnout anywhere between 0.8 and 2.4 percent. It doesn't sound like a very wide margin, but it all depends on the electoral landscape.\n\n&gt;\"We don't know exactly how much these news laws will affect turnout or skew turnout in favor of Republicans,\" said Hasen, author of the recently released The Voting Wars: From Florida 2000 to the Next Election Meltdown. \"But there's no question that in a very close election, they could be enough to make a difference in the outcome.\" \n\nNeedless to say, there really is no consensus, but by whatever measurement, I think at the very least, the net result of these voter ID laws is probably a wash; even the smaller estimates are around that same 90,000 figure you give.\n\n[Here's a segment from Democracy Now!](http://www.democracynow.org/2008/1/10/supreme_court_considers_voter_id_law) from 2008 that says basically the same stuff that I've already said.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1h1ej6", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_caq8h65", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1372206026", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_capymw5", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430687920, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "green", "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_capytcr", "author_flair_text": "[CPA][Libertarian]", "created_utc": "1372180507", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_capy50m", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1430688004, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm saying it's not a systemic problem.

Your label says libertarian, but in what sense is a requisite citizen ID part of a smaller government?\n\n&gt;So why not have Voter ID allowances draw from the I-9 (with the exception of Green Cards and other forms that show legal residence but not citizenship)?\n\nAgain, it seems like you are just making shit up as you go. That would be nice, to allow any form of ID on the form count as valid ID (although you should note that one of the forms of ID is a voter registration card, which makes this proposal moot), but most voter ID laws have very narrow definitions of what constitutes valid voter ID.\n\n&gt;Seems to me that if you can manage to get IDs out to those who don't have them - which they need to fully participate in the modern world to begin with - having a control against fraud is a no-brainer.\n\nAgain, I thought we were talking about the *actual* voter ID laws, not AuditorTux's ideas of perfect voter ID laws.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_capymw5", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1372180049", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_capxkwm", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1430688311, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "green", "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_capy50m", "author_flair_text": "[CPA][Libertarian]", "created_utc": "1372178747", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; I'll concede that, but only if that's true, which I admit I'm highly skeptical about, unless of course you show me evidence.\n\nI think he's correct that, at least in some states, you can get an ID only card at no charge from the state.
