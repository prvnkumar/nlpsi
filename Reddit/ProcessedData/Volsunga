It originally meant something closer to what we call Libertarian today (except for the whole isolationism thing). Basically Reagan was criticizing Carter's economic foreign policy (negotiating free trade agreements) and called it \"liberal\" as if it were a dirty word (he was trying to appeal to protectionists that were afraid of jobs being outsourced). Like Bugs Bunny calling Elmer Fudd \"Nimrod\" , nobody understood the reference and just thought \"liberal\" was another word for \"left wing\". It made a weird sort of sense due to common use of the word \"liberal\" meaning \"too much\", and the Left liked spending money. The media started using it in the new sense as a buzzword and before anyone noticed it was being used wrongly, it became an everyday word.\n\nMost on the educated left prefers the label of \"progressive\", which is actually an opposition to \"conservative\". Even this isn't exactly right due to a significant portion of the history of the American right being progressive. American conservatives joining the Republicans starts with Nixon, but the identity of \"conservative\" is much older.\n\nPolitical factions in the US are a bit more complicated than they first appear.

The persecution of gays will be limited to beatings on the street and suppression of their ability to speak out. \n\nAs for \"evil Russia trying to take over the world again\", Putin's regime is behaving like the start of an authoritarian state that will last a while. They probably won't go full totalitarian, but will likely end up being \"big Belarus\". Despite a culture of irredentism in Russia that wants Soviet land back, offensive wars to take that land are unlikely due to both NATO protection of many former Soviet States and living in a post-nuclear age where nuclear States cannot risk war with other nuclear States for fear of mutually assured destruction. Russia may try to diplomatically annex Belarus (if Lukashenko dies before Putin) and *maybe* Ukraine (which will be met with an armed rebellion), but that's about as far as Russian expansion could go without meeting resistance from the West (even Ukraine would be extremely difficult). These are already unlikely though. \n\nSo, really not much to worry about. There won't be a world war over the issue. While things may suck for a while for gay Russians, it won't be too different from 30 years ago in the West. Basically it will lead to a lot of Russians staying in the closet or being homosexual without being gay. With the strength of Western cultural pressure, this will probably be temporary.

Plus, China is by far Pakistan's largest weapons supplier, and the two countries share close military contacts. The US does give military aid, but China *arms them*, including selling them military aircraft (including the [Chengdu J-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu_J-10)), tanks, heavy armaments, ballistic missile technology, space tech, and plays a large role in their nuclear program. Pakistan is called 'China's Israel' as a reference to the US/Israeli relationship.\n\nAnyway, Pakistan's closest alliance is probably with Saudi Arabia, with whom they have a declared 'special relationship' along the lines of the US/UK. The GCC is Pakistan's second-largest trading partner, there are around a million Pakistanis living in Saudi Arabia, and for decades now there has been extremely close cooperation in many other areas. Saudi Arabia financed the Pakistani nuclear program, and they share a large military/technology exchange program with scientists, planners, training, and weapons, and Pakistan even supplies the Saudis with medium-range nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, and they have been helping the Saudis with their nuclear program.\n\nPlus, considering that China is now the single-largest purchaser of Saudi oil, and has massive trade and infrastructure projects underway in the Arabian peninsula (and the Saudis have a national network of gas stations and refineries in China), it is safe to assume that the balance of Pakistan's interests is with their Sino/Saudi partnerships, they might be wiling to take the odd few billions of US handouts and military aid, but it is no where near as important to them as either their Chinese or Saudi relationships. \n\n\n&gt;China rapidly develops it's Navy and uses it to both secure South Pacific trade routes and project its power worldwide.\n\nChina is already perfectly capable of securing it's trade routes to the Americas, and there is no reason to assume that just because the US closed it's overseas bases that it would no longer protect it's incoming trade. It's a pretty straight, uninterrupted run from the Sea of Japan to Vancouver/Seattle and the US would obviously keep it's Hawaiian bases open. To get to the East Coast of either of the America's they just head straight down the coast to their new $40 billion canal they are building through Nicaragua. Plus, China now has some pretty serious satellite and surveillance tech, and keeping a route open across the Pacific is fully within their grasp. \n\nAlso, the EU is China's largest trading partner, and they have a fairly new freight train line to Germany, and there are three more under construction, and so they can continue their largest trading relationship without any new naval developments. \n\n&gt;which opens up new pirate-free trade routes between Eurasia and North America.\n\nYou really think that is US overseas bases were shut down that the British/Scandinavian/Netherlands to Newfoundland trade corridor would become infested with pirates?

People who are in power just use standard military or police action. In Iraq, the southern part of the country is Shi'a Iranians while the western part of the country is Sunni Arabs. The Shi'a Iranian population outnumbers the Sunni Arabs. The Hussein Baathist government was Sunni Arab and often persecuted the Shi'a Iranians. In the chaos after the American invasion, the Shi'a Iranians moved en masse to Baghdad to have more influence in the new government. In doing so, they pushed out the city's majority Sunni Arab population through violent means and restricted them to a small walled off \"Sunni district\" on the west side of the city. Now the Shi'a Iranians control most of the government and discrimination against Sunni Arabs is not uncommon in the city. Since the Sunni Arab minority has very little legal means of recourse, some extremist groups employ terrorist tactics to try to regain the power and safety they had under the Baathist government. It has more to do with nationality than religious faction (although religious faction is part of those national identities).\n\nThis comparison isn't completely accurate, but it should explain it pretty simply. You don't hear of Israeli terrorists attacking the Palestinian population because the state of Israel has the monopoly on legitimate use of force, so civilians don't feel like they need to take matters into their own hands fighting against Palestinians. Meanwhile Palestinians use terrorist tactics against the Israelis.

Neither are necessarily true.

Rank the following from most important to least important: Personal Security, Economic Freedom, Individual Liberty, Social Equality, Moral Justice.\n2. Which group do you primarily identify with (or which do you think would provide the most information about yourself to a stranger on the internet)? Family, Country, Race/Ethnicity, State/Regional Culture, Religion, Political Ideology\n3. Who do you see as the greatest obstacle to fulfilling your preferred policies (choose up to three)? Economic/Corporate Elites, Political Elites, Academic Elites, Organized Labor, News Media, Other Voters, Foreign Influence, Moral Failure, The Youth, The Elderly\n\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\nGot your answers down?\n\nGood.\n\nNow let's analyze them.\n\n-----\nThe first question is a bit of a trick question, as all those phrases are almost meaningless positive euphemisms that mean very different things to different people. However, the associations people make between these phrases can reveal what kind of rhetoric they respond to. For example, if you rate \"social equality\" and \"economic freedom\" highly, it usually means you respond to socialist or other left rhetoric, while if you rate \"individual liberty\" with \"economic freedom\" near the top, you are more likely a Libertarian. Likewise, rating \"moral justice\" and \"Personal security\" highly makes you Conservative, while \"Moral Justice\" and \"social equality\" makes you Progressive. A lot can be gleaned from this word association game, but it isn't definitive by itself.\n\n-----\nThe second question is a measure how evolved your sense of nationalism is. Very few people would choose family. If you identify with your family before anything else, you're probably either an old aristocratic family (not too common in the US) or a survivalist. Identity by country, in the US at least, is a form of civic nationalism and a good baseline that doesn't swing wildly to any particular faction. Regional identity is a sign of Conservatism, but not a strong one. It shows that you primarily judge people as being \"like you\" by the dialect they speak and the sports teams they cheer for. Racial identity isn't so much a sign of political identity as it is of poverty. However, different racial identities swing to different parties, Blacks, Arabs, and South Asians tend to join with democrats while Caucasians, East Asians, and Hispanics tend to join with Republicans. Religion is a definite sign of Conservatism, however certain religions (namely Islam) side with Democrats due to a perceived conflict with established Christian Republicans. Identifying with a political ideology is a sign of radicalism, it doesn't give you a vector on the spectrum, but it significantly increases the magnitude.\n\n-----\nThe third question measures elitism versus populism as well as demographic biases. It's basically directly asking \"Which side are you on\", but provides more detail for analysis. If your answer included any of the \"elites\" or \"the elderly\", you're a populist. If you answered \"Other voters\", \"news media\", or \"the youth\", you're an elitist. Conservative answers include \"political elites\", \"Academic elites\", \"moral failure\" and \"the youth\". Libertarian answers include \"Political elites\", \"organized labor\", \"foreign influence\", and \"news media\". Progressive answers include \"Economic/corporate elites\", \"political elites\" and \"the elderly\". Socialist answers are the same as \"progressive\" except they include \"other voters\". Of course, there's several other smaller factions, that I haven't taken the time to list out, but it should be easy for those who answer in those factions to figure out where they lie in relation to others.", "id": "t1_cdck915", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Volsunga", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1qg2jd", "id": "t1_cdcqc3k", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "cruzzer22", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cdck915", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428687888, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I really like the thought of this showing the leanings which  probably has a  higher chance if being right.  for example it would  claim i am a Libertarian survivalist which is  a definition i have never  thought of.  which is a great example of how hard this is to do.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdcqc3k", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384284828", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdd4msm", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Odpipe", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cdck915", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428681069, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I like the idea but I am curious, what did you base this on?

The populist movement in the late 19th century US included a populist ideology that favored farmers and later factory workers and scapegoated educational institutions, banks, the railroad system and urban life in general. It was notable for how widespread and influential it was (compared to populist movements in Europe, where nationalism was more popular).

Creating a party on the platform of voting reform makes no sense because the only way you could possibly get any influence is if voting reform has already been done. \n\nBut if you're asking how political parties decide their platform based on primaries, they do it by party conventions that consolidate the trends towards certain policies into a united set of ideas. Platform is not dictated by party leaders like it is in party list systems, it's strategically gamed by leaders in a way they think will get them the most votes. \n\nEdit: nevermind, I misunderstood your question. What you're describing is an authoritarian state with a sham election. Well to do that, you first get your party elected with a vast majority (65-70%), then use your power to criminalize some of the more controversial aspects of your opponents, which shatters their coalition.

The problem is you'd have a one party state, like China.

Regardless, I have not noticed a single definition for republic in any of those four sources that was mutually exclusive with democracy. And since we're talking about meanings employed by the average American, I'm avoiding any legal/political dictionaries.\n\nIf you want to, you can exclude the Google Dictionary results because they appear to be tied to Oxford Dictionaries (although I still think accessibility is key to common usage). You might also want to point out that we should be looking to what people actually use in real life rather than dictionaries, but there are two major problems with that:\n\n* If we look to what people use in real life without the aid of dictionaries, you've either got to find a really nice study (I can't find anything on SSRN, JSTOR, or Project MUSE at the moment but maybe I'm entering the wrong search terms; I don't have access to Lexis so maybe you could check that- I'm also a bit database-challenged so maybe I'm looking in the wrong places) or rely on anecdotal evidence. If you want to rely on anecdotal evidence, here's my submission: I've only seen that definition of republic used by two wanna-be pedants so far, though I'll concede I haven't been alive for very long.\n\n* Dictionaries are meant to reflect word usage by the speakers they're attempting to represent. I think a broad cross-section of dictionaries is the best way to represent real-world usage.\n\n\n\n## EDIT: Just saw your other comment.\n\n&gt; In common parlance a republic is a state that does not practice direct democracy but rather has a government indirectly controlled by the people. This understanding of the term was originally developed by James Madison, and notably employed in Federalist Paper No. 10. This meaning was widely adopted early in the history of the United States, including in Noah Webster's dictionary of 1828. It was a novel meaning to the term; representative democracy was not an idea mentioned by Machiavelli and did not exist in the classical republics.\n\nEven this definition couldn't be used to argue that the two are mutually exclusive, seeing as it only mentions a republic as being distinct from a **direct** democracy. Furthermore, the last sentence identifies \"representative democracy\" as a subset or synonym of \"republic,\" so there's no reason to assume that a republic automatically means \"not a democracy.\"\n\nUltimately, you can't just say Boehner's power is justified simply because the US \"isn't a direct democracy\" either, because that doesn't automatically justify every purported check against tyranny of the majority or even demonstrate that the powers accorded to Boehner represent a check against majority rule.", "edited": 1382319304, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ccvxbi7", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1382309887", "ups": 6, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_ccvwv5x", "score": -3, "retrieved_on": 1429047900, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ougkb", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ccvwyo2", "author_flair_text": "[Political Consultant/BA Pol Sci][Center-Left]", "created_utc": "1382308928", "ups": -3, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_ccvwoas", "score": 6, "retrieved_on": 1429047946, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Volsunga explained that a country can be both a democracy and a republic, so your explanation, though repeated by a lot of people, is wrong or at least grossly misleading.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ougkb", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ccvwv5x", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1382308659", "ups": 6, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_ccvwhe6", "score": -5, "retrieved_on": 1429048035, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I just want to help answer the OP.

A [Republic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic) is just a government in which the state is public property. To put it in simple terms, it's anything that's *not* an absolute monarchy. This includes most dictatorships, Communist states such as China and the USSR, as well as liberal democracies.\n\nThe correct term for classifying the US is [Western Liberal Democracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_democracy), or if you want to be really specific and pedantic, Federal Anglo-Saxon model Presidential Liberal Democracy. What this means is that the country is run by representatives elected by the general public with a set of guaranteed civil and economic freedoms. There's a few more technical implications in the long and pedantic version. Also, in this context, \"liberal\" has nothing to do with the political left, it just means \"free\" with an implication of \"capitalist\".\n\nSo the US *is* a Republic, but that's not very descriptive since *everyone* is a republic except the Holy See, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan. It's far more useful to use the term \"Liberal Democracy\" to describe the US because it actually explains some of the functions that are actually different from other states.\n\nWhere did you come across the terminology that \"democracy\" only means \"direct democracy\" and \"republic\" means \"representative democracy\"?

They live in [a large area](http://i.imgur.com/0C0Vc8r.jpg) that take up parts of Syria, Iraq, and Turkey, and Iran. Since the breakup of the Ottoman Empire after the first World War, they have wanted to create their own nation-state. The national borders that were drawn by Western powers divided their homeland. Throughout the Twentieth century, there has been a constant push for independence of Kurdish regions from the current states.\n\nSome big issues with the Kurds are that the biggest group fighting for Kurdish independence is the PKK, which is notorious for using terrorist tactics, especially against Turkey. Sadaam Hussein responded to Kurdish nationalism with a genocidal campaign that included the use of chemical weapons on civilian populations. The Kurdish factions were allies of the United States in beginning of the 2003 Iraq War. Currently in the Syrian Civil War, the Kurdish faction is taking advantage of the chaos to secure sovereignty over territory they believe is theirs.\n\nSo why haven't their calls for statehood been answered? Well, creating a new nation-state can cause a lot of problems, and the land that the Kurds claim is some of the most resource-rich land in the Middle East. Kurdish independence would be a blow to the economies of Iraq and Turkey. There is also the huge problem of Balkanization. When an ethnic nation becomes sovereign over a territory, ethnic cleansing soon follows and minority populations are persecuted and driven from the country.

The President can accomplish this while still maintaining the legitimacy of popular election.\n\n&gt;That's a pretty low bar\n\nThis paragraph is talking exclusively about presidential elections. In Legislative elections, the candidate that best represents the interests of the constituency is elected. Now, the constituency only counts as people who vote, and *especially* people who vote in primaries because that's where the real competition for ideas is. Since you don't vote, your ideas don't matter and thus will not become policy. You can make your ideas matter by taking part in primaries. The real question is why more people don't take part in primaries. The answer to that is that incumbent seats are endangered by any change to the primary voting population (why throw in a wildcard when the group that actually cares about primaries voted you in last election), so primaries are nowhere near as well advertised. Voting against incumbents in Primary elections is a far more effective strategy to protest the status quo than sitting out of elections.\n\n&gt;Aren't laws being passed at a historically low rate?\n\n[No.](http://i.imgur.com/paVIfTT.jpg) There doesn't seem to be a real trend of number of bills passing except that 2009 was a historic low since pre-Civil War (2010-2012 have been about average for the past century).

I'm sure somebody can benefit from the civics lesson anyway. From a moral standpoint when we consider signature strikes or Gitmo the POTUS is primary because, as you point out, he gives the actual orders.

Political power and votes are exactly the same thing.\n\nI already do realize this, but Grover Norquist and Cecile Richards are my examples because they clearly are not the sort of people you describe. Rather, they are the people who have been presented as such on the basis of their ability to raise funds rather than to rally voters. Political power is in the votes, I agree, but the precursor is no longer good ideas or qualifications but strong enough funding. (Without the money you aren't viable.) \n\nHere's one that's pretty glaring and petty:\n\n&gt;Then I don't think you understand the concept of a \"law\". It's a law in the scientific sense, not the legal sense. It's descriptive, not prescriptive. It describes the chain of causality between plurality voting and two-party systems.\n\nNo, as I already said, I'm familiar with Duverger's law. I don't think you're grasping the concept of *surrender.* We should not consider Duverger's law a reason to turn away from third parties, to forget about federal election reform, or to otherwise ignore the unhealthy state of the two major parties, one of which is stagnate and needs more primary challengers (the democrats) and the other of which is imploding from too much infighting (the republicans.)\n\nHere's the next one:\n\n&gt;Just because you wrote a letter to your representative and it didn't change his mind doesn't mean the thousands of letters written to the same guy that oppose your viewpoint weren't effective.\n\nI'm not arguing that *my* interests aren't being served. I'm arguing that the people aren't being served. As in their well-being, education and livelihood.\n\n&gt;You have to realize the immense scale of people governments deal with, also that humans are inherently really shitty at contemplating immense scales.\n\nI'm aware of this dynamic. Still, the government isn't representative or acting in the interest of the people in their districts when they, for example, fail to pass a budget or pass unfunded mandates to essential agencies like, let's say, the post office. Rhetorical and semantic acrobatics can dress that up, but the problem will remain.\n\nAs an aside: I would hardly say that identifying a problem and advocating reasoned discussion of the same is cynical. Dismal approval ratings for congress are holding and (despite your argument to the contrary which seems to leave out that this congress presently serving is on track to be the least productive in US history and \"can't even pass a fucking farm bill\") low levels of legislative productivity provide the foundation for my concern. So no, my position is neither cynical nor unfounded.\n\nAnother one: you wrote of the multi-party system\n\n&gt;(Even if you go against the interests of your constituents, as long as you hold the party line, you can be moved up the lists so your seat is guaranteed even if the party does poorly in your district).\n\nTo which I wrote\n\n&gt;We've gotten around that drawback by drawing more safe seats.\n\nAnd you then replied\n\n&gt;Gerrymandering can't protect you from primaries.\n\nWell that isn't what I said at all is it? The question isn't whether or not gerrymandering can protect you from a primary challenge, it's whether it can insulate you from having to respond to the needs of the people in your district. If gerrymandering didn't insulate elected officials from pressure to run a more representative office then why would anybody bother with it? The express purpose is to dilute the voting power of a particular bloc...\n\nThat covers most of it. I hope you'll have a chance to respond to my actual position rather than the one you ended up arguing with, but nevertheless I appreciate you taking the time to write me your lengthy and detailed response.\n\nThe only thing I wanted to leave to the end was this\n\n&gt;I apologize if this any of this sounded condescending, but you seem to have made up your mind as to what you think actually happens when in reality those ideas are a cynical fantasy.\n\nI would love to discover, to my surprise, that government was operating ideally, that everything was perfect. After all, how representative government is will be a matter of degrees and not a binary. You're right that I've already made up my mind: I'm for a maximally representative government. It is not a fantasy for me to say that I have enough information to conclude that government could be and ought to be more representative, even if I'm not familiar with every detail of the machinations (which isn't practical for anybody.)\n\n&gt;The \"reality on the ground\" is that the system is, for the most part, not the problem. The problem is that many opinionated people aren't educated in basic civics and thus get frustrated when their ideas aren't listened to (because they're using the system wrong).\n\nWell based on this we can confirm that your previously quoted apology was intended to be backhanded, but let's set that aside. You're telling me that the system isn't the problem, but what REALLY frustrates you is the opinionated people who didn't receive adequate civics education and are now complaining about how the system that gave them that education doesn't respond to their needs and they don't understand how to use it? That sounds like you're making my case for a more responsive government...\n\nEdit: I forgot to ask.\n\nLet's grant you that government IS representative and that this is satisfactory. Aren't voters then morally obliged to withhold their vote from candidates that would engage in immoral behavior (e.g. double taps)?\n\nAnnnd I missed one\n\n&gt;Voting against incumbents in Primary elections is a far more effective strategy to protest the status quo than sitting out of elections.\n\nAs though I were suggesting one should not vote in primaries?

Ethnic and gender representation is a bit of a red herring because America is a civic nation rather than an ethnic one, so you don't need a Latino in office to represent Latino interests, a black representative is just as capable of representing Latino interests. The fact that it's disproportionately white men in office has more to do with historical trends of institutionalized racism and sexism that persist in offices that prefer a lot of experience (women and minorities haven't had equal opportunities for long enough to have a proportional amount of old people with enough political experience to be elected to federal office). These old white men are just as vulnerable to being coerced by minority votes as old black, Hispanic, or Asian men or women. \n\nAs for the proportion of Representatives to population, there's no evidence that the size of a political body has any bearing on how representatives vote. The only thing more representatives causes is higher overhead costs in running the government. \n\nI already covered why plurality voting and the resulting two party system puts more policy making power in the hands of constituents. In Germany, those six parties have hard party lines that are controlled by party elites and won't change to fit the will of the constituents. Then they form post-election coalitions that end up only serving the interests of the plurality party (which is given complete control as long as the coalition survives), so 60-70% of the population is unrepresented by those controlling policy. Two party systems, on the other hand only alienate people who vote for their seat's non-incumbent every time (about 35%), everyone else has a chance to use the threat of their vote to enforce their will on their representative, even if (especially if) they voted against him.

The US system is extremely representative, especially when compared to many other liberal democracies.\n\n&gt;Are bills that enact widely supported policy provisions being passed?\n\nYes, but by definition, \"widely supported\" means \"a majority\". With protections in place for minority opinions, this can take a while between a policy idea's inception and it actually getting enough support to pass with most ideas failing to gain enough popular support. If you support an unpopular idea and surround yourself with others who share your opinion, it can create an illusion that your idea has popular support when it does not and thus it appears that the system is against you.\n\n&gt;Are groups being represented equally?\n\nThis depends what you mean by \"groups\" and \"equally\". The American system is built so individuals are represented equally. Groups such as political parties, interest groups, and corporations are only as powerful as the amount of votes they control (the people who support the ideas they forward). This means that the AARP, which represents the interests and opinions of the elderly, has more power than, say, the local Homeowner's Association. In the case of corporations, the ability to pay for advertising for a campaign controls a lot of votes (in theory at least), but is nowhere near as strong as interest group control over popular opinion. It's a popular idea that money = power, but it's only as effective as the size of the unaffiliated public (that doesn't already tie its interests to another group) that bases its votes on advertising.\n\nAs for political parties, the voting system, known as Single-Member District Plurality (or called by the dysphemism \"First Past the Post\" that betrays a horrible misunderstanding of statistics) forces there to be two parties in power due to Duverger's Law. For those familiar with the multi-party systems inherent in other kinds of voting systems, this can seem like an extreme limiting of choice. However, in practice it doesn't turn out like that. In two-party systems, many different factions come together to form coalitions *before* elections occur (rather than afterwards, like in multi-party systems). Primary elections are the most important process in determining government policy. The winner-take-all nature of elections also means that a representative is accountable to his constituents and needs to keep in contact and cater to their interests if they want to stay in office. This means that voters have power all the time instead of just during election season (evidence for this happening can be seen in approval ratings for people's own representatives, which are usually quite high despite the low approval of congress in general). Multi-party systems make their representatives accountable to their party leadership alone (Even if you go against the interests of your constituents, as long as you hold the party line, you can be moved up the lists so your seat is guaranteed even if the party does poorly in your district).\n\nNow, as to your other post on CMV, you seem to be confused about the purposes of the Legislature and the Presidency. The legislature is what controls most policy. The President has a lot of power, but for most purposes is just a figurehead. When you vote for a president, you're not voting for a dictator, you're voting for someone who you can trust to make good decisions at their own discretion even if the public is against them. The president is a check against both the \"tyranny of the majority\" and bureaucratic insulation from society. They might present partisan ideas in their campaigns to convince people that they are the kind of person they can trust to make good decisions (because if they believe what I do, they must be smart, right?), but nothing is intended as binding. The reality is, most people competent enough to do politics are capable of this job, so the \"lesser of two evils\" style voting is effective in putting the better candidate in the position. One could argue that Proportional Representation would be good for presidential elections while maintaining Single-Member District Plurality for the Legislature because it give a wider pool of applicants without damaging the public's ability to impact policy (the president won't listen to you, personally, no matter what because that's not his job).\n\nI'm not sure all this is answering what you're asking.

Cecile Richards? The American system is built so that individuals are represented *on the basis of their political power.* That means voting blocs that can mobilize and effectively execute strategies. The principle of one person one vote doesn't get you to equal representation.\n\n&gt;As for political parties, the voting system, known as Single-Member District Plurality (or called by the dysphemism \"First Past the Post\" that betrays a horrible misunderstanding of statistics) forces there to be two parties in power due to Duverger's Law.\n\nI'm familiar to Duverger's Law and I don't think that we have to throw our hands up and surrender to it. Having said that I don't think that the two-party duopoly has to fall into the ocean for the problems with the electoral system to be resolved or for the government to be representative. We can live with Duverger's law and still deliver a great deal of choice.\n\n&gt;However, in practice it doesn't turn out like that.

Now, despite the fact that we don't have a multi-party system, our reps can freely go against the interests of their constituents.\n\nOn the whole, I feel familiar with this argument, although I commend you for being particularly articulate in delivering it.

The President can accomplish this while still maintaining the legitimacy of popular election.\n\n&gt;That's a pretty low bar\n\nThis paragraph is talking exclusively about presidential elections. In Legislative elections, the candidate that best represents the interests of the constituency is elected. Now, the constituency only counts as people who vote, and *especially* people who vote in primaries because that's where the real competition for ideas is. Since you don't vote, your ideas don't matter and thus will not become policy. You can make your ideas matter by taking part in primaries. The real question is why more people don't take part in primaries. The answer to that is that incumbent seats are endangered by any change to the primary voting population (why throw in a wildcard when the group that actually cares about primaries voted you in last election), so primaries are nowhere near as well advertised. Voting against incumbents in Primary elections is a far more effective strategy to protest the status quo than sitting out of elections.\n\n&gt;Aren't laws being passed at a historically low rate?\n\n[No.](http://i.imgur.com/paVIfTT.jpg) There doesn't seem to be a real trend of number of bills passing except that 2009 was a historic low since pre-Civil War (2010-2012 have been about average for the past century).

This is exactly how it works in practice. Your cynicism is unfounded. Just because you wrote a letter to your representative and it didn't change his mind doesn't mean the thousands of letters written to the same guy that oppose your viewpoint weren't effective.

I'm sure somebody can benefit from the civics lesson anyway. From a moral standpoint when we consider signature strikes or Gitmo the POTUS is primary because, as you point out, he gives the actual orders.

Political power and votes are exactly the same thing.\n\nI already do realize this, but Grover Norquist and Cecile Richards are my examples because they clearly are not the sort of people you describe. Rather, they are the people who have been presented as such on the basis of their ability to raise funds rather than to rally voters. Political power is in the votes, I agree, but the precursor is no longer good ideas or qualifications but strong enough funding. (Without the money you aren't viable.) \n\nHere's one that's pretty glaring and petty:\n\n&gt;Then I don't think you understand the concept of a \"law\". It's a law in the scientific sense, not the legal sense. It's descriptive, not prescriptive. It describes the chain of causality between plurality voting and two-party systems.\n\nNo, as I already said, I'm familiar with Duverger's law. I don't think you're grasping the concept of *surrender.* We should not consider Duverger's law a reason to turn away from third parties, to forget about federal election reform, or to otherwise ignore the unhealthy state of the two major parties, one of which is stagnate and needs more primary challengers (the democrats) and the other of which is imploding from too much infighting (the republicans.)\n\nHere's the next one:\n\n&gt;Just because you wrote a letter to your representative and it didn't change his mind doesn't mean the thousands of letters written to the same guy that oppose your viewpoint weren't effective.\n\nI'm not arguing that *my* interests aren't being served. I'm arguing that the people aren't being served. As in their well-being, education and livelihood.\n\n&gt;You have to realize the immense scale of people governments deal with, also that humans are inherently really shitty at contemplating immense scales.\n\nI'm aware of this dynamic. Still, the government isn't representative or acting in the interest of the people in their districts when they, for example, fail to pass a budget or pass unfunded mandates to essential agencies like, let's say, the post office. Rhetorical and semantic acrobatics can dress that up, but the problem will remain.\n\nAs an aside: I would hardly say that identifying a problem and advocating reasoned discussion of the same is cynical. Dismal approval ratings for congress are holding and (despite your argument to the contrary which seems to leave out that this congress presently serving is on track to be the least productive in US history and \"can't even pass a fucking farm bill\") low levels of legislative productivity provide the foundation for my concern. So no, my position is neither cynical nor unfounded.\n\nAnother one: you wrote of the multi-party system\n\n&gt;(Even if you go against the interests of your constituents, as long as you hold the party line, you can be moved up the lists so your seat is guaranteed even if the party does poorly in your district).\n\nTo which I wrote\n\n&gt;We've gotten around that drawback by drawing more safe seats.\n\nAnd you then replied\n\n&gt;Gerrymandering can't protect you from primaries.\n\nWell that isn't what I said at all is it? The question isn't whether or not gerrymandering can protect you from a primary challenge, it's whether it can insulate you from having to respond to the needs of the people in your district. If gerrymandering didn't insulate elected officials from pressure to run a more representative office then why would anybody bother with it? The express purpose is to dilute the voting power of a particular bloc...\n\nThat covers most of it. I hope you'll have a chance to respond to my actual position rather than the one you ended up arguing with, but nevertheless I appreciate you taking the time to write me your lengthy and detailed response.\n\nThe only thing I wanted to leave to the end was this\n\n&gt;I apologize if this any of this sounded condescending, but you seem to have made up your mind as to what you think actually happens when in reality those ideas are a cynical fantasy.\n\nI would love to discover, to my surprise, that government was operating ideally, that everything was perfect. After all, how representative government is will be a matter of degrees and not a binary. You're right that I've already made up my mind: I'm for a maximally representative government. It is not a fantasy for me to say that I have enough information to conclude that government could be and ought to be more representative, even if I'm not familiar with every detail of the machinations (which isn't practical for anybody.)\n\n&gt;The \"reality on the ground\" is that the system is, for the most part, not the problem. The problem is that many opinionated people aren't educated in basic civics and thus get frustrated when their ideas aren't listened to (because they're using the system wrong).\n\nWell based on this we can confirm that your previously quoted apology was intended to be backhanded, but let's set that aside. You're telling me that the system isn't the problem, but what REALLY frustrates you is the opinionated people who didn't receive adequate civics education and are now complaining about how the system that gave them that education doesn't respond to their needs and they don't understand how to use it? That sounds like you're making my case for a more responsive government...\n\nEdit: I forgot to ask.\n\nLet's grant you that government IS representative and that this is satisfactory.

The US system is extremely representative, especially when compared to many other liberal democracies.\n\nAre you sure about that? In what way is it more representative?\n\nIn terms of like-to-like representation the US system is pretty terrible, whilst the 113th Congress looks to be more diverse, none previously have been. Blacks get the best representation, and that's down to gerrymandering rather than true representation, and even then it's only in the House where they have about 10.1% of the House seats, and are 12.6% of the population, and a single one in the Senate.\n\nOther minorities do much worse, Hispanics make up 16.4% of the population, but have only 30 in the House, a proportion of only 6.8%, and in the Senate, just 3.\n\nIt's not just minorities, there are only 98 women in the whole of Congress, 78 in the House and just 20 in the Senate. \n\nNow compare this to other Western liberal democracies, namely European countries, Sweden is one of the best in this category, a gender split of 55% / 45%. The [International Human Development Indicator](http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/indicators/83506.html) places the US at 100th place (the default setting is on overall HDI) below countries like Venezuela, Indonesia and even the UAE. And definitely below other liberal democracies.\n\nOn racial representation, it's more difficult in Europe, simply because you have a lot more homogeneous countries with usually over 85% of a single majority.\n\nAnother way I can see representation is through views being represented, and first-past-the-post fails in that. PR gives the voter much more choice, in the German system, you have 6 parties. Those 6 parties aren't the total in Parliament, they are the total in government. Surely that's much more representative than possibly having 49% of your district / state / country ignored? Even in the only FPTP left in Europe, that being the UK, we have multiple parties. With 2 major, Conservative and Labour, one semi major being Lib Dems, and then a smattering of smaller parties the UK looks to be still more representative.\n\nFinally, you have actual representation, how many people do you need to represent. The US is by far the worst in this category, though I could suppose that's due to it's size. However 535 federal representatives is still a fairly small government, the UK has only 66 million people, and has 625 MP's, plus 750 or so Lords (Who might be unelected, but are still representatives).\n\n**TL;DR The US federal system is one of the least representative liberal democracies, and is actually less representative than many non-liberal democracies in some respects.**", "id": "t1_cb53673", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "naryn", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "It's more representative because it put constituents in power rather than party elites. Ethnic and gender representation is a bit of a red herring because America is a civic nation rather than an ethnic one, so you don't need a Latino in office to represent Latino interests, a black representative is just as capable of representing Latino interests. The fact that it's disproportionately white men in office has more to do with historical trends of institutionalized racism and sexism that persist in offices that prefer a lot of experience (women and minorities haven't had equal opportunities for long enough to have a proportional amount of old people with enough political experience to be elected to federal office). These old white men are just as vulnerable to being coerced by minority votes as old black, Hispanic, or Asian men or women. \n\nAs for the proportion of Representatives to population, there's no evidence that the size of a political body has any bearing on how representatives vote. The only thing more representatives causes is higher overhead costs in running the government. \n\nI already covered why plurality voting and the resulting two party system puts more policy making power in the hands of constituents. In Germany, those six parties have hard party lines that are controlled by party elites and won't change to fit the will of the constituents. Then they form post-election coalitions that end up only serving the interests of the plurality party (which is given complete control as long as the coalition survives), so 60-70% of the population is unrepresented by those controlling policy. Two party systems, on the other hand only alienate people who vote for their seat's non-incumbent every time (about 35%), everyone else has a chance to use the threat of their vote to enforce their will on their representative, even if (especially if) they voted against him. In practice this gives you complete ideological freedom instead of having to choose between 4-10 strict and unbending platforms that only care about forwarding their ideology rather than building trusting relationships with constituents in order to buy their votes.\n\nAs you point out, there's a lot of ways to define how \"representative\" a government is.

In a presidential race doesn't the swing-district voter have more power in this sense? Or the primary voter? What if your state doesn't have open primaries? In a congressional race like Warren/Brown were major donors and Joe Voter on the same playing field? A 'generic' US voter considered in that context means little in terms of the representative quality of government.", "id": "t1_cb54bb4", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "No, voters in swing states may get pandered to a lot more, but their votes have equal power. Not that it matters, trying to elect a single leader using any and every possible definition of \"fair\" soon ends up being a convoluted mess (look up the election process for the Doge of medieval Venice).\n\nPrimary voters absolutely have more power, and anyone can be a primary voter just like anyone can be a general voter. If your state doesn't have open primaries, then register with a party (just like registering to vote), it's not like it's binding for the general election if nobody you like gets nominated. \n\nMoney is power only by proxy in politics. Money buys advertising which raises awareness of a candidate and therefore possible votes. The average voter still holds the power in the end and can choose not to be swayed by the advertisements paid for by rich donors. Put simply, the power of donors is only in their ability to get votes. If Donor A buys a commercial that convinces 22 people to vote for Candidate B, those 22 people have the same power as another random selection of 22 voters in the district. Donor A is only influential because people follow his ideas and therefore candidate B.

If your state doesn't have open primaries, then register with a party (just like registering to vote), it's not like it's binding for the general election if nobody you like gets nominated. \n\nSo register for a party even if you wouldn't vote for their candidates, so that you can vote in their primaries? What if you're a 20 year member of the opposition party? Not everybody should have to call themselves a R or D in order to fully exercise their franchise and open primaries can give the people that freedom.\n\n&gt;Money is power only by proxy in politics.\n\nNo money is viability in politics: without the money you're sunk and nobody will support you because they know you're going to lose. Even if they know you can garner popular support (hence money is MORE valuable than votes because you won't make it to the general without money.)\n\n&gt;Donor A is only influential because people follow his ideas and therefore candidate B.\n\nNo 'Donor A' is pretty clearly influential because of their money.

That meets your criteria of power-as-policy-determination.\n\n&gt;Not that it matters, trying to elect a single leader using any and every possible definition of \"fair\" soon ends up being a convoluted mess\n\nThis is what I was talking about when I said that we shouldn't surrender to Duverger's Law. Because elections cannot be universally fair there's no sense in having them be fair at all? This is quite cynical. Not that it matters, you already acknowledge that they get pandered to 'a lot more.' By your definition *that is political power* so you've already acknowledged that the voter doesn't have equal power.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "There was no secret conspiracies revealed by the cables. Everything \"interesting\" that was released is stuff you'd learn in undergraduate Political Science. That doesn't mean that the release was harmless, though. One example is a few memos between China and the US that show that China doesn't support North Korea as much as they say publicly. While it's true that everyone with an education already knows this, the release of the cables amounts to a public declaration of no confidence in the North Korean regime by China. This has a destabilizing effect on the region due to the Kim regime's dependence on Chinese deterrence as a large portion of their foreign policy. It makes them less predictable and more likely to do something irrational if they believe that they are alone against the world.\n\nIt also destroys confidence in American diplomats, because a breach in security means that people don't have the luxury of speaking candidly anymore for risk of angering other parties should it get out. As much as conspiracy theorists like Julian Assange might think this is a good thing (his ideology is that everything spoken in secret is necessarily detrimental to society), it really hurts people's ability to negotiate and therefore makes conflict more likely.\n\nThe public doesn't need to know that the ambassador to Canada thinks a local soap opera has anti-American undertones or that the ambassador to Cambodia isn't a fan of the local cuisine. These kinds of things make up the majority of the cables. These personal anecdotes can be useful to analysts and can harm the individual diplomat's relations with people within the country if they get out (some people are really proud of their food). Diplomats need to feel comfortable sharing their insights without fear of risking their job for saying something that could be interpreted as politically incorrect.\n\nTransparency can be important, but international diplomacy is not a good place to start forcing it. The release of these documents was largely destructive to the foreign policy of the United States and several other countries. This is not because it revealed something embarrassing or evil that was happening, but because it hindered communication with the global hegemon.\n\nIf you want to understand how diplomacy and intelligence actually work (not like the movies), [Mark Lowenthal](http://www.amazon.com/Intelligence-Secrets-Policy-Mark-Lowenthal/dp/1608716759) is a great source and basically required reading for anyone going into that field.", "id": "t1_cac55uy", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Volsunga", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1fnkf4", "selftext": "IIRC, another example of a potential harm was that it was revealed more explicitly that Saudi Arabia was very concerned about Iran's nuclear weapons program and hinted at starting their own if things got too hot.

But when said out loud it can cause problems in relations.\n\nAnother problem, and it became part of the meta-debate about publishing WikiLeaks stuff in general, is that there were names of translators and sources in places like Afghanistan and Iraq.

Seriously, I gave NSDAP answers and it called me a \"Democratic National Liberal\". Look at the \"stats\" page. If almost all the top ideological categories are politically left, there's something fundamentally wrong with the test. Looking at the sources, it's based on a browser game, so no wonder it's so horrible.\n\nHere's some advice: don't look to politically identify yourself unless you really know what you're studying. It should be primarily an academic exercise, not a way to define yourself. Almost every one of these kinds of tests (especially online) have an agenda and are trying to convince you to identify with ideologies they agree with and shy away from opposing ideologies. They do this by classifying you based on some of your beliefs that are more popular that align with the group and once you believe in the label you've been given, you associate with the rest of that label's ideology. Usually it's not that cynical and the test creators are just not educated enough to eliminate their own biases. The worst offender of this is the Nolan Chart, designed to make people classify themselves as Libertarian.\n\nGo ahead and pursue a political science degree if it interests you. The government and academic work in political science is largely non-politicized, so it really doesn't matter what you believe as long as you can put those beliefs aside to analyze situations objectively. If you want to go for elected office, take Poli Sci in undergrad and then go to law school.

Single-Member District Plurality (also called First Past the Post) gives individual representatives the freedom to represent the interests of their district before the interests of their political parties. What basically happens is that coalitions between ideological factions happen before the elections instead of after them like other systems.\n\nProportional Representation systems (like Germany, Italy, and France) cause the country to be ruled unilaterally by a single ideological group that the majority of the country voted against. It also breeds political radicalism that tends to be contained by restricting freedom of speech. There are more ideological groups holding seats in the legislature, but only one dictating policy.\n\nAlternative voting methods like Instant-Runoff Voting or Cumulative Voting tend to create governments with the negative aspects of both SMDP and PR. They create larger third parties that are able to hold seats but not affect policy while the two main parties turn into ideological monoliths rather than the vague associations they are in SMDP. This causes a stagnant political atmosphere that polarizes the country.\n\nOne thing to always keep in mind is that between 10-20% of the population in most liberal democracies is bigoted xenophobic nationalists. In systems like the US, this demographic either doesn't vote or votes Republican and the party maybe throws out a few comments to pander to the voter base but ultimately doesn't dictate policy based on their ideology. In France, this bloc forms a political party called the National Front that has a significant influence on policy. It also drags the center-right party to adopt more radical stances to take their voters and keep the radical party's power down. In Germany, this group is repressed by restrictions on civil liberties and occasionally riots in the streets. Systems that favor centrism tend to work out better for the people living in them.\n\nThe problem with voting in the US is that people in the current generation never learned how to use the system. Since coalitions are formed prior to the elections, primary elections are extremely important in affecting policy. The Tea Party is an excellent case study in how to actually affect policy in the US. They did everything right, including forwarding candidates within the Republican party, making sure those candidates were elected via primary elections, and making incumbent Republicans pander to their ideology.\n\nI'll admit I'm a little intoxicated right now, so I might not have explained things completely.

I'm going to expand on Volsunga's speculation. There's some evidence to suggest that N. Korea has a system of tunnels underneath the DMZ. Of course, we're not talking about tunnels large enough to convey a sizable invasion force. There's also the fact that the two countries share a sizable coastline. S. Korea (+ the US) has a very good navy, but things would certainly be able to slip through. Then, add in cannon fodder soldiers who would be willing to cut a path across the DMZ even if it meant killing themselves. N. Korea has been staring at the DMZ for decades now, and no defense (including that minefield) is impassable or insurmountable. \n\nI'm not sure how large the force would be, but N. Korea certainly has the capability to take a large (or important: children, political leaders) number of S. Koreans hostage. Take this and add in media coverage and you have a good bargaining chip. Also, consider that even if we don't want to give an invasion force credence, you don't need more than a special forces unit to set up a nuke or dirty bomb in Seoul. Even if it's just a bluff, that's a serious bluff to call in the heart of one of the most populated cities.\n\nFurther, if I was N. Korea, I would just blame it all on a rogue general. In an extraordinary act of shame, Kim admits (perhaps privately) that a rogue general is responsible for these crimes. \n\nSo, no, I don't think that's necessarily total war. It's a very risky gamble, but it might be worth it. Who knows how much Kim's power is threatened right now? Who knows if there is an actual rogue general somewhere? Who knows how bellicose (if not insane) Kim is? If we're willing to speculate that N. Korea attacks, and doesn't go for total victory, but also doesn't just do something useless like torpedo a US ship, then it would probably look something like this. \n\n*2. I think your Iraq/Afghanistan references have merit, but you misapply them. Or, at least they aren't so clear that another strategic mind (e.g. Kim and his Generals) can't see them another way. I think those examples show that the US (esp. under Obama) would be very hesitant to commit the US to something of that magnitude. From the beginning of the invasion, the US would already be on its heels in terms of being willing to depose Kim, rather than just pull a Kuwait. They would want the job to be done mostly by S. Korea, and maybe try to rope China in. S. Korea is rhetorically committed to a reunified peninsula, but S. Korea isn't pragmatically any more committed to the project than the US is. There would be strong reasons to believe that given the right scapegoats and concessions, Kim could survive to fight another day.

I think it is safe to assume that there are still some tunnels which have not been found. \n\nAs for the length of the war, lets look at your comparison to Iraq. The actual invasion of Iraq, from the opening shots to the fall of Baghdad lasted 21 days. A large amount of that time was spent in the logistics of transporting troops over vast distances with relative few roads. Iraq as an area of 169,235 sq mi, while North Korea is just 46,528 sq mi. \n\nThe Iraqi army consisted of 375,000 Iraqi troops and 2,200 tanks before the war began. The North Korean army is FAR larger, with somewhere around 1.1 million active service members and very nearly 30% of the entire population can be mobilized for reserve duty. However, the logistics of maintaining an offensive force of that size through intense bombing are staggering, especially considering that they would have to cross the DMZ somehow. Tunnels might be able to get troops through in the initial stages of the war, but once they are discovered, they would be quickly collapsed by bombing. A war with hundreds of thousands of soldiers behind enemy lines with only artillery support (while it lasts) and what they can scavenge in hostile territory is going to be a short war. \n\nSpeaking of artilery, I think the most under represented threat in the North Korean arsenal is their chemical and biological weapon stock pile. During talks in 2005, North Korea stated that their military doctrine included firing 1 chemical artillery round for every 2 conventional rounds. It is also likely that North Korea has weaponized anthrax, bubonic plague, and possibly small pox in its arsenal. Any land invasion of North Korea is going to be incredibly costly in terms of lives, on both sides.\n\nThe actual occupation of North Korea may be less problematic than you believe. Remember that the North Korean people live in a VERY centralized society. Most of their day to day lives are controlled by the state. A collapse of the central government would throw the majority of the country into disorder, which while in the short term is difficult to deal with, in the long term is suitable ground for reunification. The average North Korean lives in near complete poverty, so raising their standard of living after reunification benefits greatly from the law of diminishing returns. Providing basic healthcare, food, and eventually electricity is far more than the majority of these people have under the current regime. I'm not going to say we will be greeted as liberators, because we all know how that turned out, but I certainly don't think we are facing another Afganistan. \n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9df0ro", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1365726329", "distinguished": null, "ups": 7}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Killericon", "id": "t1_c9db4wh", "parent_id": "t1_c9d70ab", "score": 18, "retrieved_on": 1431590328, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;followed by a mad rush of soldiers to take hostages of the survivors and try to use those hostages to negotiate favorable terms of cease-fire\n\nI just don't know if the traditional land force of the North Koreans could do a \"mad rush\" across the 4 heavily mined kilometers of the DMZ and then across 35 kilometers of likely heavily bombarded(US air strikes, South Korean artillery, you name it) to Seoul.

Fascism doesn't fit nicely on the dipolar political spectrum and has always been a catalyst for debate on where to actually place it. There are several different ways that political scientists categorize it. The standard justification for placing it on the far right that is taught in schools is that it is associated with traditionalist and cultural values like Conservativism. It also tends to favor some of the established aristocracy. This doesn't completely fit though, because Fascism also uses a command economy and nationalizes private businesses that contribute to the military-industrial complex. It also is highly populist, which pushes it towards the center.\n\nThere are a couple alternate models that attempt to solve these problems. There's the Nolan model which uses two axes to describe right/left and authoritarian/libertarian. This model is not very popular among political scientists because it's pretty much a Libertarian propaganda tool.\n\nAnother model uses similar reasoning to the libertarian model but keeps it on a single axis. This bring fascism near the center of the spectrum. It also gives the caveat that fascism is \"radical centrism\". This fits well with how fascists tend to view themselves, being the \"third way\" away from Communism and Liberalism. While this model more accurately places Fascism on the spectrum, it is a hard sell to the layman because they equivocate \"centrist\" with \"moderate\" (which fascism certainly is not).\n\nA third model, which I personally prefer, does away with the Cartesian spectrum and instead places things on a triangle with Liberalism, Fascism, and Communism on each point. It places individual platforms by counting the amount of shared ideological concepts with the three extremes and assigning a \"gravity\" score towards each point. The advantages of this model are that it doesn't force you to try to turn every issue into a dichotomy (which in some cases doesn't make sense because there are more than two options with separate lines of thinking) and it can be used to describe politics before the 19th century by switching out the ideologies that don't exist yet for the extremes of the time. The disadvantage is that it is used by pretty much nobody (it is something one of my grad school professors is trying to push).\n\nThis difficult placement is why you see people on both the left and the right accusing each other of being Nazis.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_19zbhk", "selftext": "The international system is fundamentally amoral. Morality doesn't really have a say. The closest thing you have is norms, which are a bit different than morals. Norms are somewhat subjective, as they are the dependent on the consensus of states in the international system. They are also temporal, which means that they are locked to the time in which the consensus was agreed upon. You can't judge WWI Germany for the use of chemical weapons in war because the agreed upon norm was that they were to be used.\n\nThe \"merging\" of norms and morals is entirely a product of the optimism of the 1990s. Since there was no \"great evil\" (Communism) anymore, states were free to develop a normative structure based on a personal  morality where freedom is promoted and evil always punished. This had some successes (Gulf War, NATO intervention in Bosnia, Libyan War), and some failures (Rwandan Genocide, battle of Mogadishu, UN intervention in Yugoslavia). Basing your foreign policy decisions on personal morality tends to set precedence that you can never live up to. Playing world police sounds fine on paper to some, but can always be spun as being immoral and imperialistic. Likewise non-interventionism looks good on paper to others, but always can be spun as \"not caring about brown people/not fixing the mess you caused\". Playing the morality game doesn't work well on the state level because states are not people.\n\nSo basically, Terrorism/evil stuff is okay sometimes. Not if it only advances the interests of the country, but it also needs to be able to be justified to a community that accepts a set of norms. If the norms at that time allow terrorism as a valid means of causing political change, then it is considered acceptable. At the current time, terrorism/evil stuff is not okay in any way and is strongly reacted against. Back in the Cold War, it was okay because the two poles of power were in a fight to the death and anything was preferable to destruction (which could also mean the end of the world by nuclear holocaust).\n\ntl;dr: when talking about the international system, \"morality\" is determined by consensus and is only applicable over the time period that that consensus holds.", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Volsunga", "id": "t1_c8sy6v5", "parent_id": "t3_19zbhk", "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1431538308, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1362895436, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8sy6v5", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1362895162", "distinguished": null, "ups": 4}

Nothing to do with ideology, laziness, or demonization.\n\nIn a Single-Member district plurality voting system like in the USA, Canada, and UK, only two parties can exist in a stable way. This is [Duverger's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law) and it is a basic function of how democracies work. The two main \"parties\" are not ideological monoliths like we see in multi-party democracies that use a party-list system. Instead, the two parties are actually coalitions of smaller parties and ideologies, the coalitions are just formed prior to the election instead of afterwards. The Green Party and its ideals are already represented within the Democratic Party. Just like the Libertarians are already represented in the Republican party.\n\nMost Americans understand this intuitively, since we are conditioned by civics training to elect representatives on their individual platforms rather than their party. There is a small segment of the public that is educated enough to know that European countries do it differently with parties representing very specific ideologies, but not educated enough to understand why they are different. This is where the \"third parties\" come from.\n\nThat is not to say that third parties are always useless. In rare situations, a third party can take a popular side on an issue that neither of the two main parties represent. This is what happened with the Liberal Democrats in the UK. Both the Conservative and Labour parties supported the war in Iraq, despite its unpopularity, causing a significant portion of the population to switch to the third party. The situation is not stable, though, the Liberal Democrats will either replace Labour as the main left party or fade back into obscurity.\n\nIn most cases, however, voting third party should be considered a long-term strategy to convince one of the main parties to adopt the third party's policy by damaging their proportion of votes enough that they risk losing to the other main party.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "One of the basic ideological features of American Conservatism is that \"technological advancement is *always* good\". The rise of environmentalism in mainstream American politics in the 1960s challenged this belief with the idea that \"technological advancement leads to destruction of nature\". Conservatives saw this \"new\" ideology as a threat to society and opposed it with all their political power. Since environmentalism was appropriated by the American Left, this created a sharp divide in politics. This divide became so fundamental to each viewpoint that the radicals on both sides form conspiracy theories and fabricate evidence to support their worldview. Each side had its \"victories\" with scientific evidence \"proving\" their worldview. Environmentalists got CFCs and Climate Change right, Conservatives got GMOs and Nuclear energy right.\n\nWhat you basically have is two diametrically opposed philosophical views of technology, each having significant representation in the two main political parties of the US. Both construct elaborate fantasies to support their worldview when confronted by science that contradicts them. Republicans, who align with American Conservatism, still support the fantasy that Climate Change is not real because it supports their idea that \"technology can do no harm\". Before you say \"but renewable energy *is* technological advancement\", you need to remember that it is not a rational belief. Since the idea was originally forwarded by environmentalists, they believe there must be an ulterior motive and find ways to rationalize their opposition. One of the most common rationalizations I've seen in my personal experience is that they view the personal accosting style of Climate Change norm entrepreneurship of environmentalists (\"*You* are hurting the environment and need to reduce *your* carbon footprint\") as offensive and think \"it must be false because everyone that believes it is a rude asshole\".\n\nBefore you think that this is just attacking Republicans, you should remember two things, Climate change denial in the American Right has fallen sharply over the past few years, and environmentalists can be just as irrationally anti-scientific on certain subjects, especially GMO crops (but that's getting a bit off-topic).", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Volsunga", "id": "t1_c8poe7y", "parent_id": "t3_19netu", "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1431481397, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_19netu", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8poe7y", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1362429405", "distinguished": null, "ups": 4}

Republicans and Democrats are basically coalitions of various ideologies rather than ideological monoliths on their own. Unpopular opinions are repressed in both systems. Two-party systems weed them out in primary elections while multi-party systems use cordon-sanitaire. Primary voting is the most important part of the American voting system. \n\nYou are also making an unjustified moral judgment on deadlock.

Politics, among other things, is the balance between government action and public opinion on a given issue. As Dennis_Langley pointed out with some links for you, while US support of gun control has generally waned over the last 10-15 years, those in favor of gun control are still a majority and have been for some time.  \n\n&gt;\"assault rifles\" and \"high-capacity magazines\" are arbitrary terms that the public has good reason to be concerned about. There is also no evidence that restricting parts of guns or certain kinds of guns reduces casualties in mass shootings. The vast majority of gun violence in the US is urban gang violence, not mass shootings.\n\nYour argument appears to be that people ought to not think this way. I happen to agree with you, but that doesn't change the fact that they do. The question of \"Why does everyone think it's worth it to give up constitutional rights for poor reasons\" is a different question than \"Will gun control affect Democratic support?\" \n\nTo answer the question actually asked: No, it probably won't. Gun control advocates are getting what they want - the illusion of safety and the appearance of a Congress in touch with the demands of its constituents. Gun control opponents are generally not Democratic to begin with. The only people who are likely to change their opinions are people in the center, and given that the **current** trend sees a wider split between pro/anti gun control (favoring pro) than the current split between Dem/Rep (favoring Dem), it probably won't be particularly damaging as far as the centrists are concerned. \n\n&gt;Even if it is true that a majority of Americans support gun control, the constitution still protects the rights of the minority opinion.\n\nSort of. The scope of your constitutional rights is a legislative and judicial issue. The constitution protects the rights of the minority opinion within the bounds of US law. In other words, if 60% of Americans don't agree with an 'unlimited' scope for the 2nd amendment, and the laws get changed and have judicial support, then the constitution doesn't protect those rights (unlimited access to guns, in this example) anymore. It protects your rights as they are currently defined, within the limits that legislatively put in place.

The reason there is still a monarch is because there was never a violent revolution to kick them out (English Civil War doesn't count since the king came back).\n\nA Republic doesn't need a president, you can get along fine with just a parliamentary system headed by a prime minister.\n\nSince the Queen has no real power, the only thing to argue about in the Republican vs Monarchist debate is philosophical.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_14np7c", "selftext": "The government didn't lie about WMDs in Iraq. They had reasonable evidence that Saddam Hussein was hiding his chemical weapons (which turned out to be a couple years out of date). In that sense, it was an intelligence failure. The press, however, over-hyped the \"Curveball\" source that supported Iraq's acquisition of nuclear materials which turned out to be false and pretty obviously so.\n\nHere's the thing about Iraq's chemical weapons, we still don't know where they went. Lets start at the beginning, the end of the Gulf War. Iraq has a massive cache of Sarin, Anthrax, VX, Mustard, and Tabun (this is pretty much indisputable). Hussein has been given an ultimatum to destroy these weapons. The thing is, some of these weapons cannot be destroyed by a country like Iraq, they don't have the infrastructure to support the massive, expensive, and high tech plants necessary for the safe disposal of things like VX and Tabun. The whole UN controversy in the first place was because Saddam refused to hand over these weapons to a country that did have the infrastructure to destroy them. One of two things could have happened to Iraq's chemical weapons caches. He could have buried them in the desert or shipped them to Syria. What probably happened was a little of both. The problem with this is, both of these \"disposal\" procedures have the ability to be recovered in the future when the heat dies down. This happened between 1998 and 2003 and went under the radar of foreign intelligence.\n\nThe interesting thing is, we'll soon find out what happened. The conflict in Syria will probably reveal some chemical weapons that were acquired from Hussein during that time period, either from a new government or rebels uncovering some warehouses. Also, some of the weapons are nearing the point where if they were buried in the desert, their containers will start to fail. We'll probably see Iraqi children contracting anthrax and herds of livestock being poisoned before 2016.", "id": "t1_c7eu3fw", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Volsunga", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_14np7c", "id": "t1_c7eucra", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c7eu3fw", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1430643037, "controversiality": 0, "body": "You sound like a guy who knows his stuff.
