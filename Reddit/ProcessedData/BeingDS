Okie dokie.\n\n&gt;Division of labor, how does it work?\n\nApparently it only works through unfettered globalization. Right?\n\n&gt;That's not what trade barriers are.

Right? \n\nAnd don't you see that power and wealth accrue to the influential? Zero regulation doesn't lead to prosperity. It leads to oligarchy and tribalism.

If you look at American history you will see that our own dismal working conditions during the industrial revolution were not seen as some kind of \"godsend.\" People came to America from all over the world as a land of opportunity, it's true, but it didn't change the fact that many ended up working long hours for little pay, only to be tossed to the curb by an employer after they were no longer useful. This became an untenable situation because of those conditions, which gave rise to the American labor movement.\n\nSimilarly let me use a particular recent example from China. There's a film you may be able to find online called \"Red Dust\" about workers in a battery factory in China who were constantly exposed to cadmium dust. Cadmium is a heavy metal, heavier and more toxic than lead. Many of the (mostly) women who worked in this factory ended up with kidney and liver failure and were set to die by the time they were in their mid-late twenties. As a response they protested, they organized, and they lobbied their local government to do everything within their power to ensure that this wouldn't happen to others.\n\nIt is true that these are opportunities. But for unskilled labor, business has every advantage. Unskilled labor is plentiful and exploitable and without regulations, without unions, without some way of the worker making their interests heard and represented, they will be trampled *regardless* of whether the nation is or is not industrialized. A situation of extreme worker exploitation is not a necessary step on the road toward a developed society.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I'm not saying these are fun jobs.

It means that goods are mass produced and can therefore be made available at a cheaper cost to a wider section of the population.\n\nHowever even in America, an industrialized nation, if we were to do away with our labor standards and safeguards, we would see the same kind of abuses here that we see elsewhere in the world. Industrialization itself does not mean that people will be working shorter hours for a decent wage. The 8-hour-day, the weekend, safety standards, and benefits were all won from employers through unified labor. And even now, companies like Wal-Mart will intentionally keep workers on part-time work so that they don't need to provide those workers benefits. Companies, of course, seek profit by their nature.\n\nIf we are assuming that Chinese people or Indonesian people WANT to be working 12-hour-days, that is where the view becomes problematic. It may be their best option but that doesn't make the exploitation of their labor justified. They will need to demand those same things from their own employers and frankly the United States could do a lot to help working people in foreign nations. Historically we have done the very opposite. The United States has usually worked to preserve the dominant position of business and prevent a raising of living standards. Even recently, the Obama administration used its power to block a minimum wage increase in Haiti from 33 cents an hour to 66 cents an hour, despite the fact that this was unanimously approved in their parliament.\n\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/wikileaks-haiti-minimum-wage-the-nation-2011-6\n\nSo equating \"this is their best option\" with \"they really are grateful for and enjoy this work\" is the issue.

Apparently people disagreed with that.\n\nBut let's address OP's question, then. Many of these companies, whether it's Apple producing iPhones and iPads in China or Hanes producing t-shirts in Haiti, make a significant profit, enough that they could afford to increase the wage they pay their workers. Hanes, for example:\n\n&gt; Haiti has about 25,000 garment workers. If you paid each of them $2 a day more, it would cost their employers $50,000 per working day, or about $12.5 million a year ... As of last year Hanes had 3,200 Haitians making t-shirts for it. Paying each of them two bucks a day more would cost it about $1.6 million a year. Hanesbrands Incorporated made $211 million on $4.3 billion in sales last year.\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/wikileaks-haiti-minimum-wage-the-nation-2011-6\n\nNow, Haiti could increase their minimum wage, but they run the risk of losing the small amount of business they already have. In contrast, the United States and other Western nations could establish standards that they refuse to import goods that are produced under conditions such as these. In response, companies would have no other option but to take the hit on their bottom line, or raise their prices for Western consumers, and that would effectively raise the quality of life of workers throughout the third world.\n\nI would be willing to bet it would be almost universally beneficial for Western nations to establish these standards. If foreign companies wanted access to Western markets, they would need to meet those standards.\n\nAdmittedly there are other issues with this, for instance it could be seen as elitist because certain Americans maybe \"rely\" on cheaper goods, however when it comes to the amount of relieved suffering worldwide I don't think there is any comparison.", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sanemaniac", "id": "t1_cewhobn", "parent_id": "t1_cewheql", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1432064240, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cewhobn", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1390443833", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "FacelessBureaucrat", "id": "t1_cewheql", "parent_id": "t1_cewh9q2", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1432064103, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; Because it is their best option does not mean that it is a good option.\n \nThat's not the question.

Right? \n\nAnd don't you see that power and wealth accrue to the influential? Zero regulation doesn't lead to prosperity. It leads to oligarchy and tribalism. Libertarianism is a bullshit philosophy that leads to anarchy and division. Why is it good for America for the Chinese to have jobs that Americans could have?

An Amendment can be proposed one of two ways. Both ways have two steps. It can be proposed by Congress, and ratified by the states. Or on demand of two-thirds of the state legislatures, Congress could call an Article V Convention to propose an amendment, or amendments, which would only be valid if ratified by a vote of three-fourths of the states.\n\n&gt;To date, all amendments, whether ratified or not, have been proposed by a two-thirds vote in each house of Congress. Over 10,000 constitutional amendments have been introduced in Congress since 1789; during the last several decades, between 100 and 200 have been offered in a typical congressional year. Most of these ideas never leave Congressional committee, and of those reported to the floor for a vote, far fewer get proposed by Congress to the states for ratification.\n\n&gt;In the first step, the proposed Amendment must be supported by two-thirds in Congress, both House and Senate. The second step requires a three-fourths majority of the states ratifying the amendment. Congress determines whether the state legislatures or special state conventions ratify the amendment.\n\n&gt;On attaining Constitutional ratification of the proposal by three-fourths of the states, at that instant, the \"fundamental law\" is expressed in that Amendment. It is operative without any additional agency.

If you want laws more immune to corruption you need to have all the details laid out up front, not leaving the details blank for a administrative bureaucrat to fill in later.

If you want laws more immune to corruption you need to have all the details laid out up front, not leaving the details blank for a administrative bureaucrat to fill in later. No matter what those details will be written, but if they are written by the legislature than the President can't just make laws mean whatever he wants them to mean without checks or balances.\n\nPolitics is the art of the compromise.

It is good policy to help move lower income individuals and families into higher income areas/higher demand for jobs locations, but the issue is always the cost of living not the moving costs.\n\nThere is a somewhat related problem of optimizing labor supply by encouraging easy relocation. For instance, one problem with the recession is that many families and individuals that owned underwater mortgages (homes worth less than the mortgage) were unable to move where they could get a job (moving would involve selling the house which would incur major losses). Moving hits lower income families/individuals the most, and more could be done to help with that, but I guess I'm just trying to point out that there's not some major problem of lots of low cost of living areas coupled with high demand for labor.

If that cost isn't covered by that person's wage, isn't it true that everyone else has to pick up the rest of the tab through taxes to support social welfare, unless of course this person is abandoned by society and left to starve? Why is it A) more beneficial and B) more equitable; for this added cost to be passed on to taxpayers than treated by the place where that person works as a basic cost of doing business?\n\n**EDIT: Also, if your goal is for everyone to have a job (unrealistic as that may be), isn't it counter-intuitive to allow conditions to exist which require a large segment of the population to have multiple jobs in order to get by? Let's say there are 28 postings in a town. If they are required to pay enough, maybe five of the posting go away, that's still 23 jobs and 23 people can be employed and get off welfare. But with a minimum wage that's too low, nine people take three jobs each and work mega-overtime and 14 of the people who might have had jobs too don't, and one job still goes unfilled or suffers from horrible turnover, because nobody can survive on it alone. How is this sustainable? Wouldn't it be better if 1 job had to equal at least 1 basic living? At a certain point, someone who wants to own a business has to put up or shut up and make enough profits to establish him or herself as a viable concern (i.e. be able to support the people who work for him/her without turfing them to to the government assistance folks for the other half of their expenses every month).

My bad.**) indexed to inflation.\n\nYou seem to know what you're talking about. Perhaps you can answer these questions: \n\n- What is the point of a job that pays a sub-poverty wage? Isn't it a little dismissive to say that someone who has to work 60 hours a week to make a living (and often must find 3 jobs to get that many hours) should somehow find the time to go to night school (or whatever other offhand throwaway chiding they like to use) to \"better himself\"... just to make a basic subsistence wage?\n\n- Doesn't each person have at least a certain \"cost\" (since there's only so frugally that you can live, no matter how you scrimp and save)? If that cost isn't covered by that person's wage, isn't it true that everyone else has to pick up the rest of the tab through taxes to support social welfare, unless of course this person is abandoned by society and left to starve? Why is it A) more beneficial and B) more equitable; for this added cost to be passed on to taxpayers than treated by the place where that person works as a basic cost of doing business?\n\n**EDIT: Also, if your goal is for everyone to have a job (unrealistic as that may be), isn't it counter-intuitive to allow conditions to exist which require a large segment of the population to have multiple jobs in order to get by? Let's say there are 28 postings in a town. If they are required to pay enough, maybe five of the posting go away, that's still 23 jobs and 23 people can be employed and get off welfare. But with a minimum wage that's too low, nine people take three jobs each and work mega-overtime and 14 of the people who might have had jobs too don't, and one job still goes unfilled or suffers from horrible turnover, because nobody can survive on it alone. How is this sustainable? Wouldn't it be better if 1 job had to equal at least 1 basic living? At a certain point, someone who wants to own a business has to put up or shut up and make enough profits to establish him or herself as a viable concern (i.e. be able to support the people who work for him/her without turfing them to to the government assistance folks for the other half of their expenses every month). It doesn't make sense to place the entire onus of supporting the economy on the workers and treat the owners like some sort of endangered species who'll go extinct if they are required to shoulder their part of the load.**", "id": "t1_ce5gnle", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "BeingDS", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_ce5d6cn", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428068465, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1387514978, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ce5gnle", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1387453596", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_ce43g48", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428070089, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm tired of people thinking that economics is somehow just intuition.

The effect of this is to make a legislature that skews representation *away* from the diverse wants of the people to one in which every member reflects the 51% majority without need for debate or compromise.\n\n&gt; A white representative, even in the South, should be able to effectively and fairly represent all his or her constituents.\n\nWhile a white representative certainly \"should be able to\" represent everyone, you assume that one who would chose to would be elected. History suggests this assumption is incorrect.\n\n&gt; And if he or she can't then that's where the courts and the 14th Amendment come in.\n\nThe 14th Amendment was wholly ineffective in protecting black voters for 97 years.

So what's the harm? Legal precedent at this stage literally precludes any return of segregation. Besides which it would be political suicide for even the most fire-breathing racist to attempt such a thing... can you imagine how fast his or her donor base would flee? In the 50's, 60's, and 70's the return of Jim Crow was a real possibility. Today? No way.\n\n&gt;The 14th Amendment was wholly ineffective in protecting black voters for 97 years.

What you do is sue requesting an injunction to stop enforcement of any law which discriminates against you on a Constitutionally or legally protected basis.\n\n&gt;But that's exactly what your doing. All representatives will reflect the majority rather than the representatives collectively reflecting the actual demographics.\n\nInteresting point. Now that you phrase it that way, I hadn't thought of it like that. I'm still not entirely convinced that that's 100% democratic though. It seems like avoiding the problem of racism instead of addressing it. It seems to me that saying that black people can't be properly represented except by black representatives is not only perpetuating racism in and of itself but also implies the inverse, which is even more racist and limiting.\n\n&gt;I don't think the cost function (which you haven't actually defined precisely) is going to be convex.\n\nNot sure what you mean by cost function. Here's a great video about how such a process works.

I could be wrong though.\n\nHere is one [source](http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RS21656_20050923.pdf):\n\n\"A blind trust, as discussed in this report, is a device employed by a federal official\nto hold, administer and manage the private financial assets, investments and ownerships\nof the official, and his or her spouse and dependant children, as a method of conflict of\ninterest avoidance. In establishing a qualified blind trust upon the approval of the\nappropriate supervisory ethics entity, the official transfers, without restriction, control\nand management of private assets to an independent trustee who may not communicate\ninformation about the identity of the holdings in the trust to the official. The trust is\nconsidered \u201cblind\u201d because eventually, through the sale of transferred assets and the\npurchase of new ones, the public officer will be shielded from knowledge of the identity\nof the specific assets in the trust. Without such knowledge, conflict of interest issues\nwould be avoided because no particular asset in the trust could act as an influence upon\nthe official duties that the officer performs for the Government.\"\n\n----\n\"In some instances, the establishment of a \u201cqualified blind trust\u201d may be used as a\nconflict of interest avoidance device as an alternative to outright \u201cdivestiture\u201d of particular\nassets or other measures. In addition to regular reviews and possible remediations,\nofficials who are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate,\nmust file a disclosure statement within five days of nomination. The statement is to be\nreviewed and any remedial action proposed by agency or department ethics officials, then\nreviewed and approved by the Office of Government Ethics, and then forwarded to the\nappropriate Senate committee. In the executive review process, an \u201cethics agreement\u201d\nmay be entered into whereby the official, to avoid conflicts issues with respect to\nparticular assets, agrees to certain remedial action, including the transfer of assets to a\nqualified blind trust, instead of divestiture or specific disqualification agreements. The\nSenate committee initially reviewing such nomination, or the Senate as a whole, may also\nrequire from the nominee an agreement for the disposition of certain assets, including\ntheir sale or transfer to a blind trust as a condition of favorable action on the nomination\nregardless of, or in addition to, any executive branch actions and agreements.\n\nIn addition to the establishment of a blind trust as a remedial measure for specific\nconflicts of interest, blind trusts may also be created by officials on their own initiative\nto avoid potential conflict issues and/or to ease reporting burdens. Blind trusts may be\nused by such Government officials even when the disqualification requirements of federal\nlaw do not apply to them, such as for Members of Congress, the President, and the Vice\nPresident. If such trusts meet the requirements of \u201cqualified blind trusts\u201d under federal\nlaw, then disclosure may be simplified for such officials, identifying only the trust and\noverall income from it, as opposed to all individual underlying assets and transactions.\"", "id": "t1_ce47xsa", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "BeingDS", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_ce49lnd", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "DoorFrame", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1t3zk8", "selftext": "&gt;Also, do you really mean all financial assets?

It's easy to bamboozle a lowly voter, more difficult to do so with a politician who knows your games and has better access to information and more time on his hands to pay attention to what you're doing.

Only legislature electees are eligible for nomination.\n\n&gt;Why would we want the federal constitution to dictate any state constitutional process anyway?\n\nA fair question. My intention is to have the People retain some measure of control over who represents their State in the Senate, by stipulating that nominees for the Senate must come from a body of people \"pre-approved\" in a sense, by the people.

Shifting to a parliamentary system may require the Senate and House to be combined or the role of the Senate to be changed.  Also, the role or election of the President would also need to be modified.

The Apportionment Act of 1911 limits the Representative size to 435 members.

In 1790 after the first census every representative had 33,000 constituents; in 1911 that number was 212,000; we are now at 700,000 per representative.  I am not saying we should go back to 1790 level, but would say a representative should have between 100,000 and 300,000 constituents as an upper limit. \n\nI will add that the idea of raising the number of representatives has about zero change of happening.

But Canada has had multiple parties for years with a FPTP voting system. \n\n* (2) I completely disagree that this would be helpful. Remember, the goal here is a third party, not the third party *you want.* Reforming redistricting would give more control to the middle, but if previous American elections are a guide, new political parties form along the extremes. As a result, you're more likely to get a third party in districts that are very safe for either the Republicans or the Democrats. \n\nIn a far right district, a Tea Party candidate would have a real chance of beating the incumbent Republican. In a far left district, a Green Party candidate could gain enough standing to challenge a more moderate Democrat. \n\n* (3) This really won't have an effect on creating a third party, especially if the smaller districts are drawn more fairly. The more *fair* the district is, the more a center balance will exist, giving more weight to the existing two major parties as logical options in a first past the post system. \n\nSo if changing from FPTP to ranked/range voting isn't a good answer because it'd be incredibly hard to accomplish politically (try explaining to your grandma's friends how range voting works) and redistricting reform and removing the congressional size limit won't help, what will?\n\nSimple. Fix ballot access. The problem is that a qualified 3rd party potential candidate needs a ballot access line. And the way election laws are currently written, even a great candidate can't generally get on the ballot unless he becomes a part of one of the existing parties that have a spot on the ballot in a major election.\n\nEspecially as we move closer to 2014, and the GOP centrists start to push hard against letting Tea Party candidates win primaries, there will be a better and better argument for a tea party candidate to try and win from a 3rd party spot.\n\nThe problem is that unless you change ballot access rules, that candidate won't get on the ballot without gathering an inordinate number of signatures and paying a large fee. In some cases (I'm only partially confident on this part of the answer) you're required to become a member of an existing party or go through the steps to form a new one in advance of the elections (rather than allowing an individual to gain ballot access outside of a party structure). Imagine having to set up an entire party structure just to get one guy on the ballot. \n\nThe nice thing about this change is that it's fairly easily explained to any average voter. You just present the requirements for getting on the ballot as a major party nominee, vs that for a non-major party candidate. Especially when you have a popular 3rd party option, it's a pretty easy argument to say that that candidate is getting royally shafted. \n\nFortunately the rules are changing. California just switched to top two voting system with easier ballot access for non-party candidates. As more states see positive changes in governance (for both sides) from allowing better ballot access, I expect you'll see a gradual shift in that direction, especially when voters can change the law through the initiative process.", "id": "t1_cd4pteo", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "harddata", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cd4lskp", "score": 6, "retrieved_on": 1428895650, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1poy5j", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd4pteo", "author_flair_text": "[Political Consultant/BA Pol Sci][Center-Left]", "created_utc": "1383342934", "ups": 6, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t3_1poy5j", "score": 11, "retrieved_on": 1428897565, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd4lskp", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1383332769", "ups": 11, "distinguished": null}

The [idea that somehow this means the national debt must be paid is a relatively new invention](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Validity_of_public_debt) that started with the 2011 debt ceiling crisis.\n\nI've always thought it was a stretch.  The language of the text seems to be more of a novation or validation of the existing debts - that they are there, they are legal, and will be paid - because in the next sentence, the opposite is stated - Confederacy owe you money?  Tough cookies.\n\nBut think about it even more - the debt ceiling is the legal maximum that the US government can borrow.  How is an amendment stating that \"all US debts will be paid\" somehow mean that the US government is free to borrow as much as it needs to fund its operations?  This isn't paying *old debt* (bonds) but rather creating *new debt*.  Unless you want to expand the definition of debt it include employment/procurement contracts, budgets and a multitude of other things.  But that expansion would be a radical change compare to how the current debt markets work.\n\nLast, in general, you can legislate that debts must be paid, but eventually reality gets in the way of legality.  If you owe interest payments of $1 trillion dollars and your income is only $900 million, there is no way to pay that debt, whether we say it is illegal to do so or not.  You will default in some form or fashion (and most finance wonks say inflating or monetizing the debt at some point becomes a soft default).  It will be unconstitutional to not honor the debt up until the point that we cannot honor the debt.

As soon as you have the popular vote from 50 states publically reported, it's not much more work to add them together to get the national total. \n\n&gt;Are we really so committed to democratic norms?\n\nThis is actually exactly why some people (including myself) think the electoral college is ridiculous.

However, the EC doesn't take that view at all.  With the EC, Wyoming gets one vote for every 177,556 people.  However, California gets one vote for every 668,556 people!

The town where this overpass was built had 130 people.  \n\nI was having lunch in my safety vest at the local cafe one morning, and one of the locals pointed out how absurd he thought it was that the state was wasting money on such an expensive project when no one in the town even wanted it.  He looked a little taken aback when I told him the overpass wasn't for the people in his town; it was for the trucks driving from Texas to Canada.  The rail crossing was unsafe for the oversized trailers.  \n\nMost of the federal investments in Nebraska follow this pattern.

If big macs sold for 100 bucks, you could pay cashiers a lot more, but they don't.\n\nSo a cashier who sells electronics from Best Buy should make about 100x more than a cashier who sells fast food? After all Blu-Ray players and Playstations are much more expensive than double cheeseburgers... Right?\n\nExcept... that's *not* how it works. You really ought to think things through before you say them, sport.\n\n&gt;Exactly that, they would be forced out of the market. By your logic, why not raise the minimum wage to 100 dollars an hour? Heck, why not 1000? We'll all be millionaires!!!!\n\n...Or we could have a sensible minimum wage of $11-$15 per hour depending on the average cost of living in the area in question, and not go full retard. Why should a business which generates poverty by paying people less that what they can live on *not* be forced out of the market if it's unwilling to keep pace with the rest of the economy?\n\n&gt;In what world do you live in where a 55% increase in costs is infinitesimal?\n\nLet's say you have a small business with 10 minimum wage employees. Right now, you're paying them $7.25 an hour, for a total cost of $72.50 an hour and since you're open from 8am-10pm each day, that's $1,015 per day. The wage goes up to $11 per hour. Now you're paying a total of $110 an hour and $1,540 per day. That's a difference of $525. If you own a business with 10 people on staff and you can't adjust in a cost-of-business increase of 525 bucks, then you run a shit business anyway, and the economy isn't losing any of it's tentpoles when you go under. The same goes for a more extreme example. Walmart employs ~2 million minimum wage workers. So the same wage increase would cost them ~$105 million per day. But since [Walmart makes an average of ~$36 million per hour](http://www.statisticbrain.com/wal-mart-company-statistics/) (between $504 million to $864 million per day depending on how many stores are open 24 hours), they can easily internalize this cost. They might decide to raise prices a bit, but that's life in the big city.\n\n&gt;I have a machine that replaces a fry cooker, but costs the equivalent of 12 dollars an hour\n\nThis is almost funny. It's not about whether the machine is cheaper, not if you care about your business' reputation and customer base. It's about whether the machine can do the job as well or better than a person can. \n\nHow many businesses do you think would stay afloat if they went to an inferior method of service to save a buck? What a smart business does is provide the best service it can, whatever that means. Like I said, paying people shit to try and make their jobs tech-proof is stupid. When the tech is better than what a person can provide, he'll be replaced, whether he makes 2 cents or $200 an hour. \n\n&gt;He shouldn't. He should be allowed to offer any work he wants for any pay he wants. But you, the guy who thinks he can plan the economy, you DO have to consider it because you aren't trying to get one job done, you're trying to plan the economy, which means finding part time work for people who want it.\n\nThis is literally an incoherent blob of nonsense. You haven't got a clue what you're talking about. People shouldn't be required to worry about offering their services for less than a living wage. Why in the world would anyone want to? How in the world is that helpful? You can't pay half your rent, or a third of your electric bill, so what's the point of a fraction of an income for a full day's work? \n\n&gt;the guy who thinks he can plan the economy\n\nAs opposed to you, the guy who thinks that the economy works best when no planning goes into it? Sure, guy. Whatever.\n\nWhy should part time work pay less per hour minimum than full time work?

Like I said. Raising the minimum isn't defying a scientific principle, it's just forcing people to start at x amount when the commodity in question is the labor of a human being.\n\n&gt;Jacking up the cost of labor to produce them will cause people to shift to other goods.\n\nRight. So perhaps it should be the job of the company to ensure that their product is something that people want, even when a person has to be paid a living wage to make it. \n\nThat strikes me as a lot better than companies shoveling crap at us and then making the excuse that they should be able to give their workers starvation wages because the product isn't worth it.\n\n&gt;And what, pray tell, defines a meaningful [sic]\n\nI'm assuming you meant to finish that sentence with \"contribution\". \n\nA meaningful contribution to an economy, in terms of wages, is a wage that allows a person to live free of deprivation.\n\n&gt;the millions of jobs worth less than 11 bucks an hour that you want to destroy in order to make yourself feel morally superior\n\nThis is rich. I'm going to break it down a bit.\n\n&gt;millions of jobs worth less than 11 bucks an hour\n\nAgain. There is no such thing as a job's \"worth\". There is no such thing as a person's labor's \"value\". These are fairy tale concepts that cheap employers and conservatives sling around to make themselves sound intelligent to people who don't think about things before they internalize and regurgitate them. I'll direct you (again) back to your own quote: \n\n*\"Labor is worth what everything is worth, it is based on what other people will pay for it\"*\n\n*-/u/cassander*\n\nLabor is worth what an employer decides it's worth. If the minimum wage goes up to $11, or $15, or $22; employers can decide that continuing have employees is worth it, or they can do the work themselves -- or they can always decide to stop operating a business. What do you think their decision will be?\n\n&gt;that you want to destroy\n\nNo job is \"destroyed\" or \"created\". If there is a need for a position to exist, then it will exist. The employer will internalize the cost of having that position filled, because that's the cost of doing business. If an employer can eliminate a position and continue to meet demand, then that position was, by definition, superfluous; subject to elimination whether or not any change in minimum wage law occurred.\n\n&gt;in order to make yourself feel morally superior\n\nOh, right. Since I'm a godless, CEO-questioning pinko, I must be trying to make myself feel good about being an enemy of freedom, reality TV, and apple pie; instead of, ya know... giving a damn about my society, my country and my fellow human beings by showing concern about how they're paid and treated and whether or not they can contribute to a strong economy on the wage they're given.\n\n&gt;More than a 7 dollar employee, sure, not more than an 11 dollar one\n\nThat difference is infinitesimal. \n\n&gt;But if you don't understand how raising labor costs eventually results in technological replacement\n\nTechnological replacement happens anyway.

Right now, you're paying them $7.25 an hour, for a total cost of $72.50 an hour and since you're open from 8am-10pm each day, that's $1,015 per day. The wage goes up to $11 per hour. Now you're paying a total of $110 an hour and $1,540 per day. That's a difference of $525. If you own a business with 10 people on staff and you can't adjust in a cost-of-business increase of 525 bucks, then you run a shit business anyway, and the economy isn't losing any of it's tentpoles when you go under. The same goes for a more extreme example. Walmart employs ~2 million minimum wage workers. So the same wage increase would cost them ~$105 million per day. But since [Walmart makes an average of ~$36 million per hour](http://www.statisticbrain.com/wal-mart-company-statistics/) (between $504 million to $864 million per day depending on how many stores are open 24 hours), they can easily internalize this cost. They might decide to raise prices a bit, but that's life in the big city.\n\n&gt;I have a machine that replaces a fry cooker, but costs the equivalent of 12 dollars an hour\n\nThis is almost funny. It's not about whether the machine is cheaper, not if you care about your business' reputation and customer base. It's about whether the machine can do the job as well or better than a person can. \n\nHow many businesses do you think would stay afloat if they went to an inferior method of service to save a buck? What a smart business does is provide the best service it can, whatever that means. Like I said, paying people shit to try and make their jobs tech-proof is stupid.

What is the formula for determining what a person's labor is worth? How can a person definitively see what his or her worth is? I'd like a link, please.\n\nThey can't and it doesn't come from anywhere. It's 100% subjective. Companies look at what their competition is paying and offer the same or a little more. That's it. If they can't afford to, they offer less and are slowly phased out of the employment market unless they catch up. \n\nThere is *no set or scientific worth for a person's labor*. If the minimum wage is $11, McDonald's will pay $11 for a cashier, or they'll close up. And good riddance to any company which can no longer do it's bit in the economy by paying people a meaningful wage. \n\nI think it's pretty rich that some folks will take this sink-or-swim approach to individuals but when it's a company that doesn't have the wherewithal to make a meaningful contribution, all of a sudden it's this sacred thing that has to be catered to, and anyone who suggests otherwise is a god-hating, entitled pinko. Aren't institutions supposed to be for people's (and therefore society's) benefit, instead of the other way around? \n\nAlso, when you go to electronic screens, you still need attendants for them, technicians to fix them, people to count the money and tabulate the credit card receipts, factories to build them and replace them, armies of marketing people to both to supply them with pretty pictures to replace the human greeting of a cashier and to come up with ways to remind customers why they should continue patronizing a place which can't be bothered to have a human on hand to look them in the eye when they hand their money over. Then there's training costs for managers, franchisees and execs... installation, upgrades... the list goes on and on. At best, McDonald's would be breaking even after a period of years. Don't forget that everything costs money. Most things cost more than a low-wage employee.\n\nBesides, do you think that a CEO who makes as much as [James A. Skinner did in 2011](http://www.forbes.com/lists/2011/12/ceo-compensation-11_rank.html) ($20.71 million a year and $24.3 million in stock options) *really* creates that much productivity? It's fucking McDonald's for shit's sake. What is someone in charge of that company *honestly* doing to where he or she *personally* brings in enough money to be worth that kind of a yearly check? Your productivity=pay argument doesn't sound very strong for people making that much. \n\n&gt;No, [$450 a week] isn't [pocket change].\n\n&gt;You seem to think that the world of employment is composed entirely of heads of household looking for full time jobs\n\nFirst, $450 is not a lot of money. Per week, before taxes, it comes out to $1,800 per month and $21,600 a year. In other words, it represents a wage which barely exceeds a reasonable person's basic expenses. On a wage like that, you *might* be able to have some sort of a life when you're not at work and after the bills are paid. Don't forget that a basic 1 bedroom apartment is around $750-$1,000 a month in some places and not everyone has access to a pool of  roommates. So what we're talking about here is $800-$1,250 a month or $200-$312.50 a week (remember this is all *before* taxes) for someone making that much. Remember, too, that transportation and other costs rise the farther away from work someone has to live in order to find affordable housing. We're not talking about piles and piles of money here. We're talking about an amount that correlates to a basic ability to have a life of some kind. \n\nAnd as far as what a job is for, why in the world should we be making it so that people need second and third jobs? Doesn't that increase unemployment? One person, one job, one income, one tax burden. As soon as one person has to take two jobs, that's one job that someone who needs one can't have.\n\n&gt; far better that people make zero dollars than they make less than the minimum wage\n\nAh yes! Bow and scrape miscreants! And thank the god we created to be your invisible teddy bear that we the owners deign to bless you with even a partial income! \n\nPoverty will be ended when money is out of government and we have a system in place which provides people with a baseline.

Raising the minimum isn't defying a scientific principle, it's just forcing people to start at x amount when the commodity in question is the labor of a human being.\n\n&gt;Jacking up the cost of labor to produce them will cause people to shift to other goods.\n\nRight. So perhaps it should be the job of the company to ensure that their product is something that people want, even when a person has to be paid a living wage to make it. \n\nThat strikes me as a lot better than companies shoveling crap at us and then making the excuse that they should be able to give their workers starvation wages because the product isn't worth it.\n\n&gt;And what, pray tell, defines a meaningful [sic]\n\nI'm assuming you meant to finish that sentence with \"contribution\". \n\nA meaningful contribution to an economy, in terms of wages, is a wage that allows a person to live free of deprivation.\n\n&gt;the millions of jobs worth less than 11 bucks an hour that you want to destroy in order to make yourself feel morally superior\n\nThis is rich. I'm going to break it down a bit.\n\n&gt;millions of jobs worth less than 11 bucks an hour\n\nAgain. There is no such thing as a job's \"worth\". There is no such thing as a person's labor's \"value\". These are fairy tale concepts that cheap employers and conservatives sling around to make themselves sound intelligent to people who don't think about things before they internalize and regurgitate them. I'll direct you (again) back to your own quote: \n\n*\"Labor is worth what everything is worth, it is based on what other people will pay for it\"*\n\n*-/u/cassander*\n\nLabor is worth what an employer decides it's worth. If the minimum wage goes up to $11, or $15, or $22; employers can decide that continuing have employees is worth it, or they can do the work themselves -- or they can always decide to stop operating a business. What do you think their decision will be?\n\n&gt;that you want to destroy\n\nNo job is \"destroyed\" or \"created\". If there is a need for a position to exist, then it will exist. The employer will internalize the cost of having that position filled, because that's the cost of doing business. If an employer can eliminate a position and continue to meet demand, then that position was, by definition, superfluous; subject to elimination whether or not any change in minimum wage law occurred.\n\n&gt;in order to make yourself feel morally superior\n\nOh, right. Since I'm a godless, CEO-questioning pinko, I must be trying to make myself feel good about being an enemy of freedom, reality TV, and apple pie; instead of, ya know... giving a damn about my society, my country and my fellow human beings by showing concern about how they're paid and treated and whether or not they can contribute to a strong economy on the wage they're given.\n\n&gt;More than a 7 dollar employee, sure, not more than an 11 dollar one\n\nThat difference is infinitesimal. \n\n&gt;But if you don't understand how raising labor costs eventually results in technological replacement\n\nTechnological replacement happens anyway.

What is the formula for determining what a person's labor is worth? How can a person definitively see what his or her worth is? I'd like a link, please.\n\nThey can't and it doesn't come from anywhere. It's 100% subjective. Companies look at what their competition is paying and offer the same or a little more. That's it. If they can't afford to, they offer less and are slowly phased out of the employment market unless they catch up. \n\nThere is *no set or scientific worth for a person's labor*. If the minimum wage is $11, McDonald's will pay $11 for a cashier, or they'll close up. And good riddance to any company which can no longer do it's bit in the economy by paying people a meaningful wage. \n\nI think it's pretty rich that some folks will take this sink-or-swim approach to individuals but when it's a company that doesn't have the wherewithal to make a meaningful contribution, all of a sudden it's this sacred thing that has to be catered to, and anyone who suggests otherwise is a god-hating, entitled pinko. Aren't institutions supposed to be for people's (and therefore society's) benefit, instead of the other way around? \n\nAlso, when you go to electronic screens, you still need attendants for them, technicians to fix them, people to count the money and tabulate the credit card receipts, factories to build them and replace them, armies of marketing people to both to supply them with pretty pictures to replace the human greeting of a cashier and to come up with ways to remind customers why they should continue patronizing a place which can't be bothered to have a human on hand to look them in the eye when they hand their money over. Then there's training costs for managers, franchisees and execs... installation, upgrades... the list goes on and on. At best, McDonald's would be breaking even after a period of years. Don't forget that everything costs money. Most things cost more than a low-wage employee.\n\nBesides, do you think that a CEO who makes as much as [James A. Skinner did in 2011](http://www.forbes.com/lists/2011/12/ceo-compensation-11_rank.html) ($20.71 million a year and $24.3 million in stock options) *really* creates that much productivity? It's fucking McDonald's for shit's sake. What is someone in charge of that company *honestly* doing to where he or she *personally* brings in enough money to be worth that kind of a yearly check? Your productivity=pay argument doesn't sound very strong for people making that much. \n\n&gt;No, [$450 a week] isn't [pocket change].\n\n&gt;You seem to think that the world of employment is composed entirely of heads of household looking for full time jobs\n\nFirst, $450 is not a lot of money. Per week, before taxes, it comes out to $1,800 per month and $21,600 a year. In other words, it represents a wage which barely exceeds a reasonable person's basic expenses. On a wage like that, you *might* be able to have some sort of a life when you're not at work and after the bills are paid. Don't forget that a basic 1 bedroom apartment is around $750-$1,000 a month in some places and not everyone has access to a pool of  roommates. So what we're talking about here is $800-$1,250 a month or $200-$312.50 a week (remember this is all *before* taxes) for someone making that much. Remember, too, that transportation and other costs rise the farther away from work someone has to live in order to find affordable housing. We're not talking about piles and piles of money here. We're talking about an amount that correlates to a basic ability to have a life of some kind. \n\nAnd as far as what a job is for, why in the world should we be making it so that people need second and third jobs? Doesn't that increase unemployment? One person, one job, one income, one tax burden. As soon as one person has to take two jobs, that's one job that someone who needs one can't have.\n\n&gt; far better that people make zero dollars than they make less than the minimum wage\n\nAh yes! Bow and scrape miscreants! And thank the god we created to be your invisible teddy bear that we the owners deign to bless you with even a partial income! \n\nPoverty will be ended when money is out of government and we have a system in place which provides people with a baseline.

So perhaps it should be the job of the company to ensure that their product is something that people want, even when a person has to be paid a living wage to make it. \n\nThat strikes me as a lot better than companies shoveling crap at us and then making the excuse that they should be able to give their workers starvation wages because the product isn't worth it.\n\n&gt;And what, pray tell, defines a meaningful [sic]\n\nI'm assuming you meant to finish that sentence with \"contribution\". \n\nA meaningful contribution to an economy, in terms of wages, is a wage that allows a person to live free of deprivation.\n\n&gt;the millions of jobs worth less than 11 bucks an hour that you want to destroy in order to make yourself feel morally superior\n\nThis is rich. I'm going to break it down a bit.\n\n&gt;millions of jobs worth less than 11 bucks an hour\n\nAgain. There is no such thing as a job's \"worth\". There is no such thing as a person's labor's \"value\". These are fairy tale concepts that cheap employers and conservatives sling around to make themselves sound intelligent to people who don't think about things before they internalize and regurgitate them. I'll direct you (again) back to your own quote: \n\n*\"Labor is worth what everything is worth, it is based on what other people will pay for it\"*\n\n*-/u/cassander*\n\nLabor is worth what an employer decides it's worth. If the minimum wage goes up to $11, or $15, or $22; employers can decide that continuing have employees is worth it, or they can do the work themselves -- or they can always decide to stop operating a business. What do you think their decision will be?\n\n&gt;that you want to destroy\n\nNo job is \"destroyed\" or \"created\". If there is a need for a position to exist, then it will exist. The employer will internalize the cost of having that position filled, because that's the cost of doing business. If an employer can eliminate a position and continue to meet demand, then that position was, by definition, superfluous; subject to elimination whether or not any change in minimum wage law occurred.\n\n&gt;in order to make yourself feel morally superior\n\nOh, right. Since I'm a godless, CEO-questioning pinko, I must be trying to make myself feel good about being an enemy of freedom, reality TV, and apple pie; instead of, ya know... giving a damn about my society, my country and my fellow human beings by showing concern about how they're paid and treated and whether or not they can contribute to a strong economy on the wage they're given.\n\n&gt;More than a 7 dollar employee, sure, not more than an 11 dollar one\n\nThat difference is infinitesimal. \n\n&gt;But if you don't understand how raising labor costs eventually results in technological replacement\n\nTechnological replacement happens anyway. When you can have a machine that can do something as well or better than a person, you have the machine do it. Paying people shit wages to try and make their jobs immune to technological advancement doesn't make any sense at all.\n\n\"Hey guys I invented a machine that does the work faster and more efficiently!\"\n\n\"Shh!

Why should a business which generates poverty by paying people less that what they can live on *not* be forced out of the market if it's unwilling to keep pace with the rest of the economy?\n\n&gt;In what world do you live in where a 55% increase in costs is infinitesimal?\n\nLet's say you have a small business with 10 minimum wage employees. Right now, you're paying them $7.25 an hour, for a total cost of $72.50 an hour and since you're open from 8am-10pm each day, that's $1,015 per day. The wage goes up to $11 per hour. Now you're paying a total of $110 an hour and $1,540 per day. That's a difference of $525. If you own a business with 10 people on staff and you can't adjust in a cost-of-business increase of 525 bucks, then you run a shit business anyway, and the economy isn't losing any of it's tentpoles when you go under. The same goes for a more extreme example. Walmart employs ~2 million minimum wage workers. So the same wage increase would cost them ~$105 million per day. But since [Walmart makes an average of ~$36 million per hour](http://www.statisticbrain.com/wal-mart-company-statistics/) (between $504 million to $864 million per day depending on how many stores are open 24 hours), they can easily internalize this cost. They might decide to raise prices a bit, but that's life in the big city.\n\n&gt;I have a machine that replaces a fry cooker, but costs the equivalent of 12 dollars an hour\n\nThis is almost funny. It's not about whether the machine is cheaper, not if you care about your business' reputation and customer base. It's about whether the machine can do the job as well or better than a person can. \n\nHow many businesses do you think would stay afloat if they went to an inferior method of service to save a buck? What a smart business does is provide the best service it can, whatever that means. Like I said, paying people shit to try and make their jobs tech-proof is stupid. When the tech is better than what a person can provide, he'll be replaced, whether he makes 2 cents or $200 an hour. \n\n&gt;He shouldn't. He should be allowed to offer any work he wants for any pay he wants. But you, the guy who thinks he can plan the economy, you DO have to consider it because you aren't trying to get one job done, you're trying to plan the economy, which means finding part time work for people who want it.\n\nThis is literally an incoherent blob of nonsense. You haven't got a clue what you're talking about. People shouldn't be required to worry about offering their services for less than a living wage. Why in the world would anyone want to? How in the world is that helpful? You can't pay half your rent, or a third of your electric bill, so what's the point of a fraction of an income for a full day's work? \n\n&gt;the guy who thinks he can plan the economy\n\nAs opposed to you, the guy who thinks that the economy works best when no planning goes into it? Sure, guy. Whatever.\n\nWhy should part time work pay less per hour minimum than full time work?

I'd like a link, please.\n\nThey can't and it doesn't come from anywhere. It's 100% subjective. Companies look at what their competition is paying and offer the same or a little more. That's it. If they can't afford to, they offer less and are slowly phased out of the employment market unless they catch up. \n\nThere is *no set or scientific worth for a person's labor*. If the minimum wage is $11, McDonald's will pay $11 for a cashier, or they'll close up. And good riddance to any company which can no longer do it's bit in the economy by paying people a meaningful wage. \n\nI think it's pretty rich that some folks will take this sink-or-swim approach to individuals but when it's a company that doesn't have the wherewithal to make a meaningful contribution, all of a sudden it's this sacred thing that has to be catered to, and anyone who suggests otherwise is a god-hating, entitled pinko. Aren't institutions supposed to be for people's (and therefore society's) benefit, instead of the other way around? \n\nAlso, when you go to electronic screens, you still need attendants for them, technicians to fix them, people to count the money and tabulate the credit card receipts, factories to build them and replace them, armies of marketing people to both to supply them with pretty pictures to replace the human greeting of a cashier and to come up with ways to remind customers why they should continue patronizing a place which can't be bothered to have a human on hand to look them in the eye when they hand their money over. Then there's training costs for managers, franchisees and execs... installation, upgrades... the list goes on and on. At best, McDonald's would be breaking even after a period of years. Don't forget that everything costs money. Most things cost more than a low-wage employee.\n\nBesides, do you think that a CEO who makes as much as [James A. Skinner did in 2011](http://www.forbes.com/lists/2011/12/ceo-compensation-11_rank.html) ($20.71 million a year and $24.3 million in stock options) *really* creates that much productivity? It's fucking McDonald's for shit's sake. What is someone in charge of that company *honestly* doing to where he or she *personally* brings in enough money to be worth that kind of a yearly check? Your productivity=pay argument doesn't sound very strong for people making that much. \n\n&gt;No, [$450 a week] isn't [pocket change].\n\n&gt;You seem to think that the world of employment is composed entirely of heads of household looking for full time jobs\n\nFirst, $450 is not a lot of money. Per week, before taxes, it comes out to $1,800 per month and $21,600 a year. In other words, it represents a wage which barely exceeds a reasonable person's basic expenses. On a wage like that, you *might* be able to have some sort of a life when you're not at work and after the bills are paid. Don't forget that a basic 1 bedroom apartment is around $750-$1,000 a month in some places and not everyone has access to a pool of  roommates. So what we're talking about here is $800-$1,250 a month or $200-$312.50 a week (remember this is all *before* taxes) for someone making that much. Remember, too, that transportation and other costs rise the farther away from work someone has to live in order to find affordable housing. We're not talking about piles and piles of money here. We're talking about an amount that correlates to a basic ability to have a life of some kind. \n\nAnd as far as what a job is for, why in the world should we be making it so that people need second and third jobs? Doesn't that increase unemployment? One person, one job, one income, one tax burden. As soon as one person has to take two jobs, that's one job that someone who needs one can't have.\n\n&gt; far better that people make zero dollars than they make less than the minimum wage\n\nAh yes! Bow and scrape miscreants! And thank the god we created to be your invisible teddy bear that we the owners deign to bless you with even a partial income! \n\nPoverty will be ended when money is out of government and we have a system in place which provides people with a baseline.

Like I said. Raising the minimum isn't defying a scientific principle, it's just forcing people to start at x amount when the commodity in question is the labor of a human being.\n\n&gt;Jacking up the cost of labor to produce them will cause people to shift to other goods.\n\nRight. So perhaps it should be the job of the company to ensure that their product is something that people want, even when a person has to be paid a living wage to make it. \n\nThat strikes me as a lot better than companies shoveling crap at us and then making the excuse that they should be able to give their workers starvation wages because the product isn't worth it.\n\n&gt;And what, pray tell, defines a meaningful [sic]\n\nI'm assuming you meant to finish that sentence with \"contribution\". \n\nA meaningful contribution to an economy, in terms of wages, is a wage that allows a person to live free of deprivation.\n\n&gt;the millions of jobs worth less than 11 bucks an hour that you want to destroy in order to make yourself feel morally superior\n\nThis is rich. I'm going to break it down a bit.\n\n&gt;millions of jobs worth less than 11 bucks an hour\n\nAgain. There is no such thing as a job's \"worth\". There is no such thing as a person's labor's \"value\". These are fairy tale concepts that cheap employers and conservatives sling around to make themselves sound intelligent to people who don't think about things before they internalize and regurgitate them. I'll direct you (again) back to your own quote: \n\n*\"Labor is worth what everything is worth, it is based on what other people will pay for it\"*\n\n*-/u/cassander*\n\nLabor is worth what an employer decides it's worth. If the minimum wage goes up to $11, or $15, or $22; employers can decide that continuing have employees is worth it, or they can do the work themselves -- or they can always decide to stop operating a business. What do you think their decision will be?\n\n&gt;that you want to destroy\n\nNo job is \"destroyed\" or \"created\". If there is a need for a position to exist, then it will exist. The employer will internalize the cost of having that position filled, because that's the cost of doing business. If an employer can eliminate a position and continue to meet demand, then that position was, by definition, superfluous; subject to elimination whether or not any change in minimum wage law occurred.\n\n&gt;in order to make yourself feel morally superior\n\nOh, right. Since I'm a godless, CEO-questioning pinko, I must be trying to make myself feel good about being an enemy of freedom, reality TV, and apple pie; instead of, ya know... giving a damn about my society, my country and my fellow human beings by showing concern about how they're paid and treated and whether or not they can contribute to a strong economy on the wage they're given.\n\n&gt;More than a 7 dollar employee, sure, not more than an 11 dollar one\n\nThat difference is infinitesimal. \n\n&gt;But if you don't understand how raising labor costs eventually results in technological replacement\n\nTechnological replacement happens anyway. When you can have a machine that can do something as well or better than a person, you have the machine do it. Paying people shit wages to try and make their jobs immune to technological advancement doesn't make any sense at all.\n\n\"Hey guys I invented a machine that does the work faster and more efficiently!\"\n\n\"Shh!

We'll all be millionaires!!!!\n\n...Or we could have a sensible minimum wage of $11-$15 per hour depending on the average cost of living in the area in question, and not go full retard. Why should a business which generates poverty by paying people less that what they can live on *not* be forced out of the market if it's unwilling to keep pace with the rest of the economy?\n\n&gt;In what world do you live in where a 55% increase in costs is infinitesimal?\n\nLet's say you have a small business with 10 minimum wage employees. Right now, you're paying them $7.25 an hour, for a total cost of $72.50 an hour and since you're open from 8am-10pm each day, that's $1,015 per day. The wage goes up to $11 per hour. Now you're paying a total of $110 an hour and $1,540 per day. That's a difference of $525. If you own a business with 10 people on staff and you can't adjust in a cost-of-business increase of 525 bucks, then you run a shit business anyway, and the economy isn't losing any of it's tentpoles when you go under. The same goes for a more extreme example. Walmart employs ~2 million minimum wage workers. So the same wage increase would cost them ~$105 million per day. But since [Walmart makes an average of ~$36 million per hour](http://www.statisticbrain.com/wal-mart-company-statistics/) (between $504 million to $864 million per day depending on how many stores are open 24 hours), they can easily internalize this cost. They might decide to raise prices a bit, but that's life in the big city.\n\n&gt;I have a machine that replaces a fry cooker, but costs the equivalent of 12 dollars an hour\n\nThis is almost funny. It's not about whether the machine is cheaper, not if you care about your business' reputation and customer base. It's about whether the machine can do the job as well or better than a person can. \n\nHow many businesses do you think would stay afloat if they went to an inferior method of service to save a buck? What a smart business does is provide the best service it can, whatever that means. Like I said, paying people shit to try and make their jobs tech-proof is stupid. When the tech is better than what a person can provide, he'll be replaced, whether he makes 2 cents or $200 an hour. \n\n&gt;He shouldn't. He should be allowed to offer any work he wants for any pay he wants. But you, the guy who thinks he can plan the economy, you DO have to consider it because you aren't trying to get one job done, you're trying to plan the economy, which means finding part time work for people who want it.\n\nThis is literally an incoherent blob of nonsense. You haven't got a clue what you're talking about. People shouldn't be required to worry about offering their services for less than a living wage. Why in the world would anyone want to? How in the world is that helpful? You can't pay half your rent, or a third of your electric bill, so what's the point of a fraction of an income for a full day's work? \n\n&gt;the guy who thinks he can plan the economy\n\nAs opposed to you, the guy who thinks that the economy works best when no planning goes into it? Sure, guy. Whatever.\n\nWhy should part time work pay less per hour minimum than full time work?

What is the formula for determining what a person's labor is worth? How can a person definitively see what his or her worth is? I'd like a link, please.\n\nThey can't and it doesn't come from anywhere. It's 100% subjective. Companies look at what their competition is paying and offer the same or a little more. That's it. If they can't afford to, they offer less and are slowly phased out of the employment market unless they catch up. \n\nThere is *no set or scientific worth for a person's labor*. If the minimum wage is $11, McDonald's will pay $11 for a cashier, or they'll close up. And good riddance to any company which can no longer do it's bit in the economy by paying people a meaningful wage. \n\nI think it's pretty rich that some folks will take this sink-or-swim approach to individuals but when it's a company that doesn't have the wherewithal to make a meaningful contribution, all of a sudden it's this sacred thing that has to be catered to, and anyone who suggests otherwise is a god-hating, entitled pinko. Aren't institutions supposed to be for people's (and therefore society's) benefit, instead of the other way around? \n\nAlso, when you go to electronic screens, you still need attendants for them, technicians to fix them, people to count the money and tabulate the credit card receipts, factories to build them and replace them, armies of marketing people to both to supply them with pretty pictures to replace the human greeting of a cashier and to come up with ways to remind customers why they should continue patronizing a place which can't be bothered to have a human on hand to look them in the eye when they hand their money over. Then there's training costs for managers, franchisees and execs... installation, upgrades... the list goes on and on. At best, McDonald's would be breaking even after a period of years. Don't forget that everything costs money. Most things cost more than a low-wage employee.\n\nBesides, do you think that a CEO who makes as much as [James A. Skinner did in 2011](http://www.forbes.com/lists/2011/12/ceo-compensation-11_rank.html) ($20.71 million a year and $24.3 million in stock options) *really* creates that much productivity? It's fucking McDonald's for shit's sake. What is someone in charge of that company *honestly* doing to where he or she *personally* brings in enough money to be worth that kind of a yearly check? Your productivity=pay argument doesn't sound very strong for people making that much. \n\n&gt;No, [$450 a week] isn't [pocket change].\n\n&gt;You seem to think that the world of employment is composed entirely of heads of household looking for full time jobs\n\nFirst, $450 is not a lot of money. Per week, before taxes, it comes out to $1,800 per month and $21,600 a year. In other words, it represents a wage which barely exceeds a reasonable person's basic expenses. On a wage like that, you *might* be able to have some sort of a life when you're not at work and after the bills are paid. Don't forget that a basic 1 bedroom apartment is around $750-$1,000 a month in some places and not everyone has access to a pool of  roommates. So what we're talking about here is $800-$1,250 a month or $200-$312.50 a week (remember this is all *before* taxes) for someone making that much. Remember, too, that transportation and other costs rise the farther away from work someone has to live in order to find affordable housing. We're not talking about piles and piles of money here. We're talking about an amount that correlates to a basic ability to have a life of some kind. \n\nAnd as far as what a job is for, why in the world should we be making it so that people need second and third jobs? Doesn't that increase unemployment? One person, one job, one income, one tax burden. As soon as one person has to take two jobs, that's one job that someone who needs one can't have.\n\n&gt; far better that people make zero dollars than they make less than the minimum wage\n\nAh yes! Bow and scrape miscreants! And thank the god we created to be your invisible teddy bear that we the owners deign to bless you with even a partial income! \n\nPoverty will be ended when money is out of government and we have a system in place which provides people with a baseline.

So perhaps it should be the job of the company to ensure that their product is something that people want, even when a person has to be paid a living wage to make it. \n\nThat strikes me as a lot better than companies shoveling crap at us and then making the excuse that they should be able to give their workers starvation wages because the product isn't worth it.\n\n&gt;And what, pray tell, defines a meaningful [sic]\n\nI'm assuming you meant to finish that sentence with \"contribution\". \n\nA meaningful contribution to an economy, in terms of wages, is a wage that allows a person to live free of deprivation.\n\n&gt;the millions of jobs worth less than 11 bucks an hour that you want to destroy in order to make yourself feel morally superior\n\nThis is rich. I'm going to break it down a bit.\n\n&gt;millions of jobs worth less than 11 bucks an hour\n\nAgain. There is no such thing as a job's \"worth\". There is no such thing as a person's labor's \"value\". These are fairy tale concepts that cheap employers and conservatives sling around to make themselves sound intelligent to people who don't think about things before they internalize and regurgitate them. I'll direct you (again) back to your own quote: \n\n*\"Labor is worth what everything is worth, it is based on what other people will pay for it\"*\n\n*-/u/cassander*\n\nLabor is worth what an employer decides it's worth. If the minimum wage goes up to $11, or $15, or $22; employers can decide that continuing have employees is worth it, or they can do the work themselves -- or they can always decide to stop operating a business. What do you think their decision will be?\n\n&gt;that you want to destroy\n\nNo job is \"destroyed\" or \"created\". If there is a need for a position to exist, then it will exist. The employer will internalize the cost of having that position filled, because that's the cost of doing business. If an employer can eliminate a position and continue to meet demand, then that position was, by definition, superfluous; subject to elimination whether or not any change in minimum wage law occurred.\n\n&gt;in order to make yourself feel morally superior\n\nOh, right. Since I'm a godless, CEO-questioning pinko, I must be trying to make myself feel good about being an enemy of freedom, reality TV, and apple pie; instead of, ya know... giving a damn about my society, my country and my fellow human beings by showing concern about how they're paid and treated and whether or not they can contribute to a strong economy on the wage they're given.\n\n&gt;More than a 7 dollar employee, sure, not more than an 11 dollar one\n\nThat difference is infinitesimal. \n\n&gt;But if you don't understand how raising labor costs eventually results in technological replacement\n\nTechnological replacement happens anyway. When you can have a machine that can do something as well or better than a person, you have the machine do it.

Why should a business which generates poverty by paying people less that what they can live on *not* be forced out of the market if it's unwilling to keep pace with the rest of the economy?\n\n&gt;In what world do you live in where a 55% increase in costs is infinitesimal?\n\nLet's say you have a small business with 10 minimum wage employees. Right now, you're paying them $7.25 an hour, for a total cost of $72.50 an hour and since you're open from 8am-10pm each day, that's $1,015 per day. The wage goes up to $11 per hour. Now you're paying a total of $110 an hour and $1,540 per day. That's a difference of $525. If you own a business with 10 people on staff and you can't adjust in a cost-of-business increase of 525 bucks, then you run a shit business anyway, and the economy isn't losing any of it's tentpoles when you go under. The same goes for a more extreme example. Walmart employs ~2 million minimum wage workers. So the same wage increase would cost them ~$105 million per day. But since [Walmart makes an average of ~$36 million per hour](http://www.statisticbrain.com/wal-mart-company-statistics/) (between $504 million to $864 million per day depending on how many stores are open 24 hours), they can easily internalize this cost. They might decide to raise prices a bit, but that's life in the big city.\n\n&gt;I have a machine that replaces a fry cooker, but costs the equivalent of 12 dollars an hour\n\nThis is almost funny. It's not about whether the machine is cheaper, not if you care about your business' reputation and customer base. It's about whether the machine can do the job as well or better than a person can. \n\nHow many businesses do you think would stay afloat if they went to an inferior method of service to save a buck? What a smart business does is provide the best service it can, whatever that means. Like I said, paying people shit to try and make their jobs tech-proof is stupid. When the tech is better than what a person can provide, he'll be replaced, whether he makes 2 cents or $200 an hour. \n\n&gt;He shouldn't. He should be allowed to offer any work he wants for any pay he wants. But you, the guy who thinks he can plan the economy, you DO have to consider it because you aren't trying to get one job done, you're trying to plan the economy, which means finding part time work for people who want it.\n\nThis is literally an incoherent blob of nonsense. You haven't got a clue what you're talking about. People shouldn't be required to worry about offering their services for less than a living wage. Why in the world would anyone want to? How in the world is that helpful? You can't pay half your rent, or a third of your electric bill, so what's the point of a fraction of an income for a full day's work? \n\n&gt;the guy who thinks he can plan the economy\n\nAs opposed to you, the guy who thinks that the economy works best when no planning goes into it? Sure, guy. Whatever.\n\nWhy should part time work pay less per hour minimum than full time work?

It's not like we're talking about a lot of money here. A living wage is around $450 a week. That's pocket change to a profitable concern.\n\n&gt;what makes you think you know better than the fry cooker what price he should sell his labor for\n\nSorry, but this is a bullshit argument. No fry cook in the history of ever has negotiated his wage. It goes like this: \"You're hired. This is what we'll be paying you.\" There is no negotiating phase. And if there were, what bargaining power does a minimum wage worker have? He or she can take it or leave it, and the employer knows that.\n\n&gt;I have worked for less than minimum wage. You probably have too. should we be arrested for that? \n\nI haven't. Nor would I. But the employer who paid you less should pay you restitution and be fined for illegal labor practices. \n\n&gt;Should those jobs we freely took, despite the low pay, have been denied to us because some person we've never met decided it was too low?\n\nWho wants a job you can't live off of? What's the point of that? People work to make a living. Without the living, what's my motivation? \n\n\"Hey there sonny, if you work *super, DUPER* hard, then *some-day*, we can talk about paying you enough to live on.\" Sorry, but fuck that shit. \n\nThe minimum wage is there to provide a baseline income for everyone to start at. Square one for negotiating. It's not a king's ransom, so stop talking about it like it's a barrier to job creation. Job creation isn't even a real concept. Businesses hire who they need when they need them. They don't hire extra people just because they can do so cheaply.  \n\nWhy should we prop up businesses which can't afford to pay people enough to live on?

What is the formula for determining what a person's labor is worth? How can a person definitively see what his or her worth is? I'd like a link, please.\n\nThey can't and it doesn't come from anywhere. It's 100% subjective. Companies look at what their competition is paying and offer the same or a little more. That's it. If they can't afford to, they offer less and are slowly phased out of the employment market unless they catch up. \n\nThere is *no set or scientific worth for a person's labor*. If the minimum wage is $11, McDonald's will pay $11 for a cashier, or they'll close up. And good riddance to any company which can no longer do it's bit in the economy by paying people a meaningful wage. \n\nI think it's pretty rich that some folks will take this sink-or-swim approach to individuals but when it's a company that doesn't have the wherewithal to make a meaningful contribution, all of a sudden it's this sacred thing that has to be catered to, and anyone who suggests otherwise is a god-hating, entitled pinko. Aren't institutions supposed to be for people's (and therefore society's) benefit, instead of the other way around? \n\nAlso, when you go to electronic screens, you still need attendants for them, technicians to fix them, people to count the money and tabulate the credit card receipts, factories to build them and replace them, armies of marketing people to both to supply them with pretty pictures to replace the human greeting of a cashier and to come up with ways to remind customers why they should continue patronizing a place which can't be bothered to have a human on hand to look them in the eye when they hand their money over. Then there's training costs for managers, franchisees and execs... installation, upgrades... the list goes on and on. At best, McDonald's would be breaking even after a period of years. Don't forget that everything costs money. Most things cost more than a low-wage employee.\n\nBesides, do you think that a CEO who makes as much as [James A. Skinner did in 2011](http://www.forbes.com/lists/2011/12/ceo-compensation-11_rank.html) ($20.71 million a year and $24.3 million in stock options) *really* creates that much productivity? It's fucking McDonald's for shit's sake. What is someone in charge of that company *honestly* doing to where he or she *personally* brings in enough money to be worth that kind of a yearly check? Your productivity=pay argument doesn't sound very strong for people making that much. \n\n&gt;No, [$450 a week] isn't [pocket change].\n\n&gt;You seem to think that the world of employment is composed entirely of heads of household looking for full time jobs\n\nFirst, $450 is not a lot of money. Per week, before taxes, it comes out to $1,800 per month and $21,600 a year. In other words, it represents a wage which barely exceeds a reasonable person's basic expenses. On a wage like that, you *might* be able to have some sort of a life when you're not at work and after the bills are paid. Don't forget that a basic 1 bedroom apartment is around $750-$1,000 a month in some places and not everyone has access to a pool of  roommates. So what we're talking about here is $800-$1,250 a month or $200-$312.50 a week (remember this is all *before* taxes) for someone making that much. Remember, too, that transportation and other costs rise the farther away from work someone has to live in order to find affordable housing. We're not talking about piles and piles of money here. We're talking about an amount that correlates to a basic ability to have a life of some kind. \n\nAnd as far as what a job is for, why in the world should we be making it so that people need second and third jobs? Doesn't that increase unemployment? One person, one job, one income, one tax burden. As soon as one person has to take two jobs, that's one job that someone who needs one can't have.\n\n&gt; far better that people make zero dollars than they make less than the minimum wage\n\nAh yes! Bow and scrape miscreants! And thank the god we created to be your invisible teddy bear that we the owners deign to bless you with even a partial income! \n\nPoverty will be ended when money is out of government and we have a system in place which provides people with a baseline.

So perhaps it should be the job of the company to ensure that their product is something that people want, even when a person has to be paid a living wage to make it. \n\nThat strikes me as a lot better than companies shoveling crap at us and then making the excuse that they should be able to give their workers starvation wages because the product isn't worth it.\n\n&gt;And what, pray tell, defines a meaningful [sic]\n\nI'm assuming you meant to finish that sentence with \"contribution\". \n\nA meaningful contribution to an economy, in terms of wages, is a wage that allows a person to live free of deprivation.\n\n&gt;the millions of jobs worth less than 11 bucks an hour that you want to destroy in order to make yourself feel morally superior\n\nThis is rich. I'm going to break it down a bit.\n\n&gt;millions of jobs worth less than 11 bucks an hour\n\nAgain. There is no such thing as a job's \"worth\". There is no such thing as a person's labor's \"value\". These are fairy tale concepts that cheap employers and conservatives sling around to make themselves sound intelligent to people who don't think about things before they internalize and regurgitate them. I'll direct you (again) back to your own quote: \n\n*\"Labor is worth what everything is worth, it is based on what other people will pay for it\"*\n\n*-/u/cassander*\n\nLabor is worth what an employer decides it's worth. If the minimum wage goes up to $11, or $15, or $22; employers can decide that continuing have employees is worth it, or they can do the work themselves -- or they can always decide to stop operating a business. What do you think their decision will be?\n\n&gt;that you want to destroy\n\nNo job is \"destroyed\" or \"created\". If there is a need for a position to exist, then it will exist. The employer will internalize the cost of having that position filled, because that's the cost of doing business. If an employer can eliminate a position and continue to meet demand, then that position was, by definition, superfluous; subject to elimination whether or not any change in minimum wage law occurred.\n\n&gt;in order to make yourself feel morally superior\n\nOh, right. Since I'm a godless, CEO-questioning pinko, I must be trying to make myself feel good about being an enemy of freedom, reality TV, and apple pie; instead of, ya know... giving a damn about my society, my country and my fellow human beings by showing concern about how they're paid and treated and whether or not they can contribute to a strong economy on the wage they're given.\n\n&gt;More than a 7 dollar employee, sure, not more than an 11 dollar one\n\nThat difference is infinitesimal. \n\n&gt;But if you don't understand how raising labor costs eventually results in technological replacement\n\nTechnological replacement happens anyway. When you can have a machine that can do something as well or better than a person, you have the machine do it.

Right now, you're paying them $7.25 an hour, for a total cost of $72.50 an hour and since you're open from 8am-10pm each day, that's $1,015 per day. The wage goes up to $11 per hour. Now you're paying a total of $110 an hour and $1,540 per day. That's a difference of $525. If you own a business with 10 people on staff and you can't adjust in a cost-of-business increase of 525 bucks, then you run a shit business anyway, and the economy isn't losing any of it's tentpoles when you go under. The same goes for a more extreme example. Walmart employs ~2 million minimum wage workers. So the same wage increase would cost them ~$105 million per day. But since [Walmart makes an average of ~$36 million per hour](http://www.statisticbrain.com/wal-mart-company-statistics/) (between $504 million to $864 million per day depending on how many stores are open 24 hours), they can easily internalize this cost. They might decide to raise prices a bit, but that's life in the big city.\n\n&gt;I have a machine that replaces a fry cooker, but costs the equivalent of 12 dollars an hour\n\nThis is almost funny. It's not about whether the machine is cheaper, not if you care about your business' reputation and customer base. It's about whether the machine can do the job as well or better than a person can. \n\nHow many businesses do you think would stay afloat if they went to an inferior method of service to save a buck? What a smart business does is provide the best service it can, whatever that means. Like I said, paying people shit to try and make their jobs tech-proof is stupid. When the tech is better than what a person can provide, he'll be replaced, whether he makes 2 cents or $200 an hour. \n\n&gt;He shouldn't. He should be allowed to offer any work he wants for any pay he wants. But you, the guy who thinks he can plan the economy, you DO have to consider it because you aren't trying to get one job done, you're trying to plan the economy, which means finding part time work for people who want it.\n\nThis is literally an incoherent blob of nonsense. You haven't got a clue what you're talking about. People shouldn't be required to worry about offering their services for less than a living wage. Why in the world would anyone want to? How in the world is that helpful? You can't pay half your rent, or a third of your electric bill, so what's the point of a fraction of an income for a full day's work? \n\n&gt;the guy who thinks he can plan the economy\n\nAs opposed to you, the guy who thinks that the economy works best when no planning goes into it?

I'd like a link, please.\n\nThey can't and it doesn't come from anywhere. It's 100% subjective. Companies look at what their competition is paying and offer the same or a little more. That's it.

Aren't institutions supposed to be for people's (and therefore society's) benefit, instead of the other way around? \n\nAlso, when you go to electronic screens, you still need attendants for them, technicians to fix them, people to count the money and tabulate the credit card receipts, factories to build them and replace them, armies of marketing people to both to supply them with pretty pictures to replace the human greeting of a cashier and to come up with ways to remind customers why they should continue patronizing a place which can't be bothered to have a human on hand to look them in the eye when they hand their money over. Then there's training costs for managers, franchisees and execs... installation, upgrades... the list goes on and on. At best, McDonald's would be breaking even after a period of years. Don't forget that everything costs money. Most things cost more than a low-wage employee.\n\nBesides, do you think that a CEO who makes as much as [James A. Skinner did in 2011](http://www.forbes.com/lists/2011/12/ceo-compensation-11_rank.html) ($20.71 million a year and $24.3 million in stock options) *really* creates that much productivity? It's fucking McDonald's for shit's sake. What is someone in charge of that company *honestly* doing to where he or she *personally* brings in enough money to be worth that kind of a yearly check? Your productivity=pay argument doesn't sound very strong for people making that much. \n\n&gt;No, [$450 a week] isn't [pocket change].\n\n&gt;You seem to think that the world of employment is composed entirely of heads of household looking for full time jobs\n\nFirst, $450 is not a lot of money. Per week, before taxes, it comes out to $1,800 per month and $21,600 a year. In other words, it represents a wage which barely exceeds a reasonable person's basic expenses. On a wage like that, you *might* be able to have some sort of a life when you're not at work and after the bills are paid. Don't forget that a basic 1 bedroom apartment is around $750-$1,000 a month in some places and not everyone has access to a pool of  roommates. So what we're talking about here is $800-$1,250 a month or $200-$312.50 a week (remember this is all *before* taxes) for someone making that much. Remember, too, that transportation and other costs rise the farther away from work someone has to live in order to find affordable housing. We're not talking about piles and piles of money here. We're talking about an amount that correlates to a basic ability to have a life of some kind. \n\nAnd as far as what a job is for, why in the world should we be making it so that people need second and third jobs? Doesn't that increase unemployment? One person, one job, one income, one tax burden. As soon as one person has to take two jobs, that's one job that someone who needs one can't have.\n\n&gt; far better that people make zero dollars than they make less than the minimum wage\n\nAh yes! Bow and scrape miscreants! And thank the god we created to be your invisible teddy bear that we the owners deign to bless you with even a partial income! \n\nPoverty will be ended when money is out of government and we have a system in place which provides people with a baseline.

There is no such thing as a person's labor's \"value\".

I'll direct you (again) back to your own quote: \n\n*\"Labor is worth what everything is worth, it is based on what other people will pay for it\"*\n\n*-/u/cassander*\n\nLabor is worth what an employer decides it's worth.

What do you think their decision will be?\n\n&gt;that you want to destroy\n\nNo job is \"destroyed\" or \"created\". If there is a need for a position to exist, then it will exist. The employer will internalize the cost of having that position filled, because that's the cost of doing business. If an employer can eliminate a position and continue to meet demand, then that position was, by definition, superfluous; subject to elimination whether or not any change in minimum wage law occurred.\n\n&gt;in order to make yourself feel morally superior\n\nOh, right. Since I'm a godless, CEO-questioning pinko, I must be trying to make myself feel good about being an enemy of freedom, reality TV, and apple pie; instead of, ya know... giving a damn about my society, my country and my fellow human beings by showing concern about how they're paid and treated and whether or not they can contribute to a strong economy on the wage they're given.\n\n&gt;More than a 7 dollar employee, sure, not more than an 11 dollar one\n\nThat difference is infinitesimal. \n\n&gt;But if you don't understand how raising labor costs eventually results in technological replacement\n\nTechnological replacement happens anyway.

Why should a business which generates poverty by paying people less that what they can live on *not* be forced out of the market if it's unwilling to keep pace with the rest of the economy?\n\n&gt;In what world do you live in where a 55% increase in costs is infinitesimal?\n\nLet's say you have a small business with 10 minimum wage employees. Right now, you're paying them $7.25 an hour, for a total cost of $72.50 an hour and since you're open from 8am-10pm each day, that's $1,015 per day. The wage goes up to $11 per hour. Now you're paying a total of $110 an hour and $1,540 per day. That's a difference of $525. If you own a business with 10 people on staff and you can't adjust in a cost-of-business increase of 525 bucks, then you run a shit business anyway, and the economy isn't losing any of it's tentpoles when you go under. The same goes for a more extreme example. Walmart employs ~2 million minimum wage workers. So the same wage increase would cost them ~$105 million per day. But since [Walmart makes an average of ~$36 million per hour](http://www.statisticbrain.com/wal-mart-company-statistics/) (between $504 million to $864 million per day depending on how many stores are open 24 hours), they can easily internalize this cost. They might decide to raise prices a bit, but that's life in the big city.\n\n&gt;I have a machine that replaces a fry cooker, but costs the equivalent of 12 dollars an hour\n\nThis is almost funny. It's not about whether the machine is cheaper, not if you care about your business' reputation and customer base. It's about whether the machine can do the job as well or better than a person can. \n\nHow many businesses do you think would stay afloat if they went to an inferior method of service to save a buck? What a smart business does is provide the best service it can, whatever that means. Like I said, paying people shit to try and make their jobs tech-proof is stupid. When the tech is better than what a person can provide, he'll be replaced, whether he makes 2 cents or $200 an hour. \n\n&gt;He shouldn't. He should be allowed to offer any work he wants for any pay he wants.

It's fucking McDonald's for shit's sake. What is someone in charge of that company *honestly* doing to where he or she *personally* brings in enough money to be worth that kind of a yearly check? Your productivity=pay argument doesn't sound very strong for people making that much. \n\n&gt;No, [$450 a week] isn't [pocket change].\n\n&gt;You seem to think that the world of employment is composed entirely of heads of household looking for full time jobs\n\nFirst, $450 is not a lot of money. Per week, before taxes, it comes out to $1,800 per month and $21,600 a year. In other words, it represents a wage which barely exceeds a reasonable person's basic expenses. On a wage like that, you *might* be able to have some sort of a life when you're not at work and after the bills are paid. Don't forget that a basic 1 bedroom apartment is around $750-$1,000 a month in some places and not everyone has access to a pool of  roommates. So what we're talking about here is $800-$1,250 a month or $200-$312.50 a week (remember this is all *before* taxes) for someone making that much. Remember, too, that transportation and other costs rise the farther away from work someone has to live in order to find affordable housing. We're not talking about piles and piles of money here. We're talking about an amount that correlates to a basic ability to have a life of some kind. \n\nAnd as far as what a job is for, why in the world should we be making it so that people need second and third jobs? Doesn't that increase unemployment? One person, one job, one income, one tax burden. As soon as one person has to take two jobs, that's one job that someone who needs one can't have.\n\n&gt; far better that people make zero dollars than they make less than the minimum wage\n\nAh yes! Bow and scrape miscreants! And thank the god we created to be your invisible teddy bear that we the owners deign to bless you with even a partial income! \n\nPoverty will be ended when money is out of government and we have a system in place which provides people with a baseline.

Like I said. Raising the minimum isn't defying a scientific principle, it's just forcing people to start at x amount when the commodity in question is the labor of a human being.\n\n&gt;Jacking up the cost of labor to produce them will cause people to shift to other goods.\n\nRight. So perhaps it should be the job of the company to ensure that their product is something that people want, even when a person has to be paid a living wage to make it. \n\nThat strikes me as a lot better than companies shoveling crap at us and then making the excuse that they should be able to give their workers starvation wages because the product isn't worth it.\n\n&gt;And what, pray tell, defines a meaningful [sic]\n\nI'm assuming you meant to finish that sentence with \"contribution\". \n\nA meaningful contribution to an economy, in terms of wages, is a wage that allows a person to live free of deprivation.\n\n&gt;the millions of jobs worth less than 11 bucks an hour that you want to destroy in order to make yourself feel morally superior\n\nThis is rich. I'm going to break it down a bit.\n\n&gt;millions of jobs worth less than 11 bucks an hour\n\nAgain. There is no such thing as a job's \"worth\". There is no such thing as a person's labor's \"value\". These are fairy tale concepts that cheap employers and conservatives sling around to make themselves sound intelligent to people who don't think about things before they internalize and regurgitate them. I'll direct you (again) back to your own quote: \n\n*\"Labor is worth what everything is worth, it is based on what other people will pay for it\"*\n\n*-/u/cassander*\n\nLabor is worth what an employer decides it's worth. If the minimum wage goes up to $11, or $15, or $22; employers can decide that continuing have employees is worth it, or they can do the work themselves -- or they can always decide to stop operating a business. What do you think their decision will be?\n\n&gt;that you want to destroy\n\nNo job is \"destroyed\" or \"created\". If there is a need for a position to exist, then it will exist. The employer will internalize the cost of having that position filled, because that's the cost of doing business. If an employer can eliminate a position and continue to meet demand, then that position was, by definition, superfluous; subject to elimination whether or not any change in minimum wage law occurred.\n\n&gt;in order to make yourself feel morally superior\n\nOh, right. Since I'm a godless, CEO-questioning pinko, I must be trying to make myself feel good about being an enemy of freedom, reality TV, and apple pie; instead of, ya know... giving a damn about my society, my country and my fellow human beings by showing concern about how they're paid and treated and whether or not they can contribute to a strong economy on the wage they're given.\n\n&gt;More than a 7 dollar employee, sure, not more than an 11 dollar one\n\nThat difference is infinitesimal. \n\n&gt;But if you don't understand how raising labor costs eventually results in technological replacement\n\nTechnological replacement happens anyway. When you can have a machine that can do something as well or better than a person, you have the machine do it. Paying people shit wages to try and make their jobs immune to technological advancement doesn't make any sense at all.\n\n\"Hey guys I invented a machine that does the work faster and more efficiently!\"\n\n\"Shh!

Why should a person who's working a supplementary job consider his or her time as worth less than the time of a person who needs his or her job to survive? The job doesn't change.

Right now, you're paying them $7.25 an hour, for a total cost of $72.50 an hour and since you're open from 8am-10pm each day, that's $1,015 per day. The wage goes up to $11 per hour. Now you're paying a total of $110 an hour and $1,540 per day. That's a difference of $525. If you own a business with 10 people on staff and you can't adjust in a cost-of-business increase of 525 bucks, then you run a shit business anyway, and the economy isn't losing any of it's tentpoles when you go under. The same goes for a more extreme example. Walmart employs ~2 million minimum wage workers. So the same wage increase would cost them ~$105 million per day. But since [Walmart makes an average of ~$36 million per hour](http://www.statisticbrain.com/wal-mart-company-statistics/) (between $504 million to $864 million per day depending on how many stores are open 24 hours), they can easily internalize this cost. They might decide to raise prices a bit, but that's life in the big city.\n\n&gt;I have a machine that replaces a fry cooker, but costs the equivalent of 12 dollars an hour\n\nThis is almost funny. It's not about whether the machine is cheaper, not if you care about your business' reputation and customer base. It's about whether the machine can do the job as well or better than a person can. \n\nHow many businesses do you think would stay afloat if they went to an inferior method of service to save a buck? What a smart business does is provide the best service it can, whatever that means. Like I said, paying people shit to try and make their jobs tech-proof is stupid. When the tech is better than what a person can provide, he'll be replaced, whether he makes 2 cents or $200 an hour. \n\n&gt;He shouldn't. He should be allowed to offer any work he wants for any pay he wants. But you, the guy who thinks he can plan the economy, you DO have to consider it because you aren't trying to get one job done, you're trying to plan the economy, which means finding part time work for people who want it.\n\nThis is literally an incoherent blob of nonsense. You haven't got a clue what you're talking about. People shouldn't be required to worry about offering their services for less than a living wage. Why in the world would anyone want to? How in the world is that helpful? You can't pay half your rent, or a third of your electric bill, so what's the point of a fraction of an income for a full day's work? \n\n&gt;the guy who thinks he can plan the economy\n\nAs opposed to you, the guy who thinks that the economy works best when no planning goes into it? Sure, guy. Whatever.\n\nWhy should part time work pay less per hour minimum than full time work?

Don't forget that everything costs money. Most things cost more than a low-wage employee.\n\nBesides, do you think that a CEO who makes as much as [James A. Skinner did in 2011](http://www.forbes.com/lists/2011/12/ceo-compensation-11_rank.html) ($20.71 million a year and $24.3 million in stock options) *really* creates that much productivity? It's fucking McDonald's for shit's sake. What is someone in charge of that company *honestly* doing to where he or she *personally* brings in enough money to be worth that kind of a yearly check? Your productivity=pay argument doesn't sound very strong for people making that much. \n\n&gt;No, [$450 a week] isn't [pocket change].\n\n&gt;You seem to think that the world of employment is composed entirely of heads of household looking for full time jobs\n\nFirst, $450 is not a lot of money. Per week, before taxes, it comes out to $1,800 per month and $21,600 a year. In other words, it represents a wage which barely exceeds a reasonable person's basic expenses. On a wage like that, you *might* be able to have some sort of a life when you're not at work and after the bills are paid. Don't forget that a basic 1 bedroom apartment is around $750-$1,000 a month in some places and not everyone has access to a pool of  roommates. So what we're talking about here is $800-$1,250 a month or $200-$312.50 a week (remember this is all *before* taxes) for someone making that much. Remember, too, that transportation and other costs rise the farther away from work someone has to live in order to find affordable housing. We're not talking about piles and piles of money here. We're talking about an amount that correlates to a basic ability to have a life of some kind. \n\nAnd as far as what a job is for, why in the world should we be making it so that people need second and third jobs? Doesn't that increase unemployment? One person, one job, one income, one tax burden. As soon as one person has to take two jobs, that's one job that someone who needs one can't have.\n\n&gt; far better that people make zero dollars than they make less than the minimum wage\n\nAh yes! Bow and scrape miscreants! And thank the god we created to be your invisible teddy bear that we the owners deign to bless you with even a partial income! \n\nPoverty will be ended when money is out of government and we have a system in place which provides people with a baseline.

So perhaps it should be the job of the company to ensure that their product is something that people want, even when a person has to be paid a living wage to make it. \n\nThat strikes me as a lot better than companies shoveling crap at us and then making the excuse that they should be able to give their workers starvation wages because the product isn't worth it.\n\n&gt;And what, pray tell, defines a meaningful [sic]\n\nI'm assuming you meant to finish that sentence with \"contribution\". \n\nA meaningful contribution to an economy, in terms of wages, is a wage that allows a person to live free of deprivation.\n\n&gt;the millions of jobs worth less than 11 bucks an hour that you want to destroy in order to make yourself feel morally superior\n\nThis is rich. I'm going to break it down a bit.\n\n&gt;millions of jobs worth less than 11 bucks an hour\n\nAgain. There is no such thing as a job's \"worth\". There is no such thing as a person's labor's \"value\". These are fairy tale concepts that cheap employers and conservatives sling around to make themselves sound intelligent to people who don't think about things before they internalize and regurgitate them. I'll direct you (again) back to your own quote: \n\n*\"Labor is worth what everything is worth, it is based on what other people will pay for it\"*\n\n*-/u/cassander*\n\nLabor is worth what an employer decides it's worth. If the minimum wage goes up to $11, or $15, or $22; employers can decide that continuing have employees is worth it, or they can do the work themselves -- or they can always decide to stop operating a business. What do you think their decision will be?\n\n&gt;that you want to destroy\n\nNo job is \"destroyed\" or \"created\". If there is a need for a position to exist, then it will exist. The employer will internalize the cost of having that position filled, because that's the cost of doing business. If an employer can eliminate a position and continue to meet demand, then that position was, by definition, superfluous; subject to elimination whether or not any change in minimum wage law occurred.\n\n&gt;in order to make yourself feel morally superior\n\nOh, right. Since I'm a godless, CEO-questioning pinko, I must be trying to make myself feel good about being an enemy of freedom, reality TV, and apple pie; instead of, ya know... giving a damn about my society, my country and my fellow human beings by showing concern about how they're paid and treated and whether or not they can contribute to a strong economy on the wage they're given.\n\n&gt;More than a 7 dollar employee, sure, not more than an 11 dollar one\n\nThat difference is infinitesimal. \n\n&gt;But if you don't understand how raising labor costs eventually results in technological replacement\n\nTechnological replacement happens anyway. When you can have a machine that can do something as well or better than a person, you have the machine do it. Paying people shit wages to try and make their jobs immune to technological advancement doesn't make any sense at all.\n\n\"Hey guys I invented a machine that does the work faster and more efficiently!\"\n\n\"Shh!

Why should a business which generates poverty by paying people less that what they can live on *not* be forced out of the market if it's unwilling to keep pace with the rest of the economy?\n\n&gt;In what world do you live in where a 55% increase in costs is infinitesimal?\n\nLet's say you have a small business with 10 minimum wage employees. Right now, you're paying them $7.25 an hour, for a total cost of $72.50 an hour and since you're open from 8am-10pm each day, that's $1,015 per day. The wage goes up to $11 per hour. Now you're paying a total of $110 an hour and $1,540 per day. That's a difference of $525. If you own a business with 10 people on staff and you can't adjust in a cost-of-business increase of 525 bucks, then you run a shit business anyway, and the economy isn't losing any of it's tentpoles when you go under. The same goes for a more extreme example. Walmart employs ~2 million minimum wage workers. So the same wage increase would cost them ~$105 million per day. But since [Walmart makes an average of ~$36 million per hour](http://www.statisticbrain.com/wal-mart-company-statistics/) (between $504 million to $864 million per day depending on how many stores are open 24 hours), they can easily internalize this cost. They might decide to raise prices a bit, but that's life in the big city.\n\n&gt;I have a machine that replaces a fry cooker, but costs the equivalent of 12 dollars an hour\n\nThis is almost funny. It's not about whether the machine is cheaper, not if you care about your business' reputation and customer base. It's about whether the machine can do the job as well or better than a person can. \n\nHow many businesses do you think would stay afloat if they went to an inferior method of service to save a buck? What a smart business does is provide the best service it can, whatever that means. Like I said, paying people shit to try and make their jobs tech-proof is stupid. When the tech is better than what a person can provide, he'll be replaced, whether he makes 2 cents or $200 an hour. \n\n&gt;He shouldn't. He should be allowed to offer any work he wants for any pay he wants. But you, the guy who thinks he can plan the economy, you DO have to consider it because you aren't trying to get one job done, you're trying to plan the economy, which means finding part time work for people who want it.\n\nThis is literally an incoherent blob of nonsense. You haven't got a clue what you're talking about. People shouldn't be required to worry about offering their services for less than a living wage. Why in the world would anyone want to? How in the world is that helpful? You can't pay half your rent, or a third of your electric bill, so what's the point of a fraction of an income for a full day's work? \n\n&gt;the guy who thinks he can plan the economy\n\nAs opposed to you, the guy who thinks that the economy works best when no planning goes into it? Sure, guy. Whatever.\n\nWhy should part time work pay less per hour minimum than full time work?

The last time I went to a jack-in-the box, there was a kiosk where you could place your order.  The a couple of people in our group used it, for novelties sake, but the menue confirmed every choice with an annoying loud voice.  When they work out the kinks, it will likely become the standard.

Teenagers are capable of this in a way computers simply aren't.  \n\nYour example of the self checkout at the grocery store is a good one, because it would happen regardless of the minimum wage.  Those machines are saving grocers thousands of hours of labor costs, + any benefits they might have offered their human employees, + legal costs like workers comp and threat of litigation.  They can also save on management costs, because 1 technician can service hundreds of machines, where previously they needed a dozen managers for hiring/firing, record keeping, scheduling and training.  Cutting the minimum wage to a fourth it's current level wouldn't bring those jobs back, because the automation still makes financial sense.  \n\nSo, raising the minimum wage will have nearly no effect on employment.

Shouldn't there have been an entire infrastructure ethically and forthrightly parsing SIPR message traffic for the things PFC Manning found himself confronted with?

You, the contributor, and the committee to which you give are both legally responsible for making sure that your contribution does not exceed your contribution limits. The paragraphs below list the contribution limits for individuals.\n\n&gt;Contribution Limits\nAn individual may give a maximum of:\n\n&gt;$2,600 per election to a Federal candidate or the candidate's campaign committee.2 Notice that the limit applies separately to each election. Primaries, runoffs and general elections are considered separate elections.\n$5,000 per calendar year to a PAC. This limit applies to a PAC (political action committee) that supports Federal candidates. (PACs are neither party committees nor candidate committees. Some PACs are sponsored by corporations and unions--trade, industry and labor PACs. Other PACs, often ideological, do not have a corporate or labor sponsor and are therefore called nonconnected PACs.) PACs use your contributions to make their own contributions to Federal candidates and to fund other election-related activities.\n$10,000 per calendar year to a State or local party committee. A State party committee shares its limits with local party committees in that state unless a local committee's independence can be demonstrated.\n$32,400 per calendar year to a national party committee. This limit applies separately to a party's national committee, House campaign committee and Senate campaign committee.\n$123,200 total biennial limit. This biennial limit places a ceiling on your total contributions, as explained below.\n$100 in currency (cash) to any political committee. (Anonymous cash contributions may not exceed $50.) Contributions exceeding $100 must be made by check, money order or other written instrument.\n\n\n\n&gt;Doing so would involve prohibiting the human journalists from publishing.\n\nNo, because those journalists could still \"publish\".

[Choice voting refers to the method outlined in this link.](http://www.fairvote.org/how-choice-voting-works#.Udiq3238kdV) It is basically STV in superdistricts.  \n2. Ranged preference voting is a wide range of different voting methods, such as Instant Run-off Voting (IRV), Single Transferable Vote (STV), and others that fit the criteria. \n3. The President and Vice President are already separate elections. By having endorsements you essentially ensure that while people keep their right to vote split votes for the two, it is likely that a President will have the Vice President of their choosing, and you also get the benefits of a campaign partner that we have today. However with a ranged preference voting method such as STV, you have a bigger likelihood of a Vice President being someone different than this endorsement, which is risky for the President, so this is one potential flaw in the system should the two ever be diametrically opposed. \n4. See the link in #1, or [this link](http://www.fairvote.org/list/author/Super_Districts#.Udisam38kdU). Any body that has multiple members rather then a single position that has one person would do, but this should be open to the lawmakers to an extent. \n5. I wrote that specifically in regard to this. That is, when extending the time to fit one group's needs, you must extend it to everyone. If one group can file an absentee ballot, everyone else can too. This is specifically so demographics like the military cannot be given better or worse treatment than everyone else to tamper with results. Administration is pretty simple. If a state has a voting ID requirement that requires them to be down at the DMV or other state office, they can call up a hotline and schedule a ride to and from said location at the expense of the state. Obviously such an expense will discourage the states from having ID laws that have strict requirements, but this is intentional, as ID requirements can be used to tamper with results by targeting demographics. Obviously the whole thing would need to be expanded on by lawmakers, but I'm writing the intent and policy as per the question, not the whole law.

[From the FEC website:](http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/citizens.shtml)\n\n&gt;How Much May Be Contributed\n\n&gt;Your contributions to Federal candidates and committees are limited under the law. You, the contributor, and the committee to which you give are both legally responsible for making sure that your contribution does not exceed your contribution limits. The paragraphs below list the contribution limits for individuals.\n\n&gt;Contribution Limits\nAn individual may give a maximum of:\n\n&gt;$2,600 per election to a Federal candidate or the candidate's campaign committee.2 Notice that the limit applies separately to each election. Primaries, runoffs and general elections are considered separate elections.\n$5,000 per calendar year to a PAC. This limit applies to a PAC (political action committee) that supports Federal candidates. (PACs are neither party committees nor candidate committees. Some PACs are sponsored by corporations and unions--trade, industry and labor PACs. Other PACs, often ideological, do not have a corporate or labor sponsor and are therefore called nonconnected PACs.) PACs use your contributions to make their own contributions to Federal candidates and to fund other election-related activities.\n$10,000 per calendar year to a State or local party committee. A State party committee shares its limits with local party committees in that state unless a local committee's independence can be demonstrated.\n$32,400 per calendar year to a national party committee. This limit applies separately to a party's national committee, House campaign committee and Senate campaign committee.\n$123,200 total biennial limit. This biennial limit places a ceiling on your total contributions, as explained below.\n$100 in currency (cash) to any political committee. (Anonymous cash contributions may not exceed $50.) Contributions exceeding $100 must be made by check, money order or other written instrument.\n\n\n\n&gt;Doing so would involve prohibiting the human journalists from publishing.\n\nNo, because those journalists could still \"publish\".

We have people cross the aisle constantly because political parties in the United States are fundraising operations. At any time anyone can run as a democrat, republican, or green if they can form a fundraising team. Remember a republican in Chicago is way more liberal than a liberal in North Dakota.\n\nSo we get rid of the american system because we want to encourage third parties. Let's try \n\n\n- _ -- _ -- _ -- _ -- _ -- _ -- _ -- _ -- _ -- _ -- _ -- _ -\n\nProportional!\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/German_federal_election%2C_2005_-_Final.png/250px-German_federal_election%2C_2005_-_Final.png \n\nFantastic, so now 5% of the population votes Green like I did. We actually get representation! Yet, I didn't want representation, I wanted to vote who I voted for. Proportional voting gives parties the right to create diversity and not the people who are voting. What's this really mean? The parties who run are running on a platform and all politicians owe their success to that platform. That creates homogeneous parties who will negotiate as a group rather than the constant in-party competition seen in the United States. In Chicago you would see the same Democrat elected and party chosen players til the end of time. In real life, people get to decide which person the party chooses. .\n\nAnd How! Well there's these awesome people like me who volunteer/work internships who can support candidates as an individual. More importantly the primaries or pre-polling allows politicians from the same party to compete for the people's support which is nice cause the other system is this weird kiss ass mentality. Now if you only vote in the last elections than you'll never know more than the few options you see. Yet, there's a huge amount of freedom in choosing politicians in the primary and the ideas that can be introduced are far ranging.\n\nBut but but...the mutli-parties is what introduces new ideas! No, parties only introduce new agendas as the deem will get them elected. In the two party system, individuals from multiple backgrounds can present new ideas way back in the primary and the success of their campaign pushes their party forward. By the time you get to president election you end up getting two carbon copy candidates who appeal to the most voters. Yet, all these new ideas that have been discussed every election up to it has helped shape what it means to be moderate. Like gay marriage, illegal immigration, etc.\n\n\n_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -\n\n\nStill have some arguments? Shoot, but I need to eat soon, so let's move on.\n\n_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -\n\nRated voted and multi-voting options.\n\nThis of way voting gives extremists unnecessary weight or weaklings extra weight. Let's say you are an extreme fascist Greek and you only support Hitler version two. Throw all you votes to him rate everyone shitastic and call it a day. If other people split their voted moderately on three candidates than you just gave Captain Fascist the equivalent of three votes.\n\nWait wait wait, we control for more moderation you need over 50 of the people to mark you on the ballot or label you positive. Sweet this is slightly better, but it actually just gives Dr. moderate Weaklingpants the election. I love Mr. Black Richards cause he's a democrat and Im ok with Dr. Moderate Weaklingpants, because when I look at Rev. Prayer Mormon over there my bowels quake. I mark my two peeps or rank them and move on. Sheriff Godfear also walks into the ballot and makes the opposing decision. Dr Moderate picks up the middle and the people, voting out of fear, gets a Weaklingpants in the design of Jimmy Carter. Poor administrations threatens no one.\n\nOR\n\nThere's more wanton Black Richards gobblers in the the country, so the democrats win just as before and nothing even changes.\n\n_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -_- _ -\n\nFeel free to throw other voting options at me.

I used to work on the Hill, albeit very briefly. Congressional staffers are paid very poorly, like 20-50k/yr. These people are writing laws and contacting constituents. Their work impacts millions, shit, it affects the entire world. They work ridiculous hours and the stress takes a huge toll on people. Average turnover time is 18 months. The culture is horrible. Additionally, this contributes to the \"revolving door\". Nobody wants to stay in a high-stress, low paying job for their entire lives, especially since most of them spent the time and money to get a master's degree or law degree.

He doesn't even consider the fact that the voting methods, and ballot access for each of the 51 ballots for president, is different.\n\nSecond, his assertion that cities can't outnumber rural areas is completely wrong.  His analysis is based on geopolitical boundaries, with no regard for how Metropolitan Areas actually work.  For example, the city of Redmond, WA (where Microsoft is based) has a population of only about 55k people, yet it is unquestionably part of the Seattle Major Metropolitan Area, which, all told, jumps the area referred to as \"Seattle\" from 620k to 3.4M people who have basically the same, Major-City interests.  And that's only including the people who are over 12 years old (because this is marketing data).

Ranged preference voting is a wide range of different voting methods, such as Instant Run-off Voting (IRV), Single Transferable Vote (STV), and others that fit the criteria. \n3. The President and Vice President are already separate elections. By having endorsements you essentially ensure that while people keep their right to vote split votes for the two, it is likely that a President will have the Vice President of their choosing, and you also get the benefits of a campaign partner that we have today. However with a ranged preference voting method such as STV, you have a bigger likelihood of a Vice President being someone different than this endorsement, which is risky for the President, so this is one potential flaw in the system should the two ever be diametrically opposed. \n4. See the link in #1, or [this link](http://www.fairvote.org/list/author/Super_Districts#.Udisam38kdU). Any body that has multiple members rather then a single position that has one person would do, but this should be open to the lawmakers to an extent. \n5. I wrote that specifically in regard to this. That is, when extending the time to fit one group's needs, you must extend it to everyone. If one group can file an absentee ballot, everyone else can too. This is specifically so demographics like the military cannot be given better or worse treatment than everyone else to tamper with results. Administration is pretty simple. If a state has a voting ID requirement that requires them to be down at the DMV or other state office, they can call up a hotline and schedule a ride to and from said location at the expense of the state. Obviously such an expense will discourage the states from having ID laws that have strict requirements, but this is intentional, as ID requirements can be used to tamper with results by targeting demographics. Obviously the whole thing would need to be expanded on by lawmakers, but I'm writing the intent and policy as per the question, not the whole law.

Getting things done does not require one, or even a small number of individuals, but a large collective effort of individuals who are motivated to overcome their laziness.\n\nHistorically, those compulsive mechanism were force, and societal pressure (slavery, serfdom, etc.). Free-market capitalism has been successful at creating unprecedented levels of human success (food production, life expectancy, etc.) because it forces individuals who do become lazy to bear the burden of that laziness directly, rather than spreading it out over society.\n\nIn fact, I agree with Mr. Long on many points -- particularly regarding inheritance, which I believe should be taxed heavily -- but if you believe that he is advocating for a degree of laziness with his strategy I think that you are misinterpreting his goal. In fact, he is directly combating the entitlement of those who become lazy through wealth.\n\nThe problem, IMO, with modern interpretations of Long, and others, is that they apply his model to their recieving personal goods -- free food, free whatever -- when he was advocating a stronger emphasis on the public goods -- roads, infrastructure, programs for all people.

It happens without fail.  I really just need to save this so I can keep from retyping it each time.\n\nFirst, lets examine the \"75-year requirement\" and see what it really is.  [Here's the law's text](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr6407/text).  I'd refer you to 802(a)(1)(A).  It sets the liability (what needs to be funded) as the actuarial present value of benefits to current and former employees (A) and the sum of the actuarial value of payroll deductions from future employees over that same period (B i).  (ii) is your pension expense calculation and (iii) is merely a catch-call if the rules actuaries abide by changes.  That's just the pension.\n\nFor the healthcare portion, see Section 803, which amends the current US Code by adding 8909a.  (Now referring to this code's new text)  You'll see the similar language with calculating the healthcare liability as you saw above with the pension plan.  Future benefits for current and former employees is covered (2)(A)(i) but there is no future employees taken into consideration.\n\nThere's the law.  Feel free to read yourself if you think I've interpreted it wrong.  But the law is one thing, lets look at the funding status:\n\nHere is the [USPS Inspector General's report](https://www.uspsoig.gov/foia_files/ft-ma-12-002.pdf) of the funding levels of the USPS' retirement and healthcare obligations.  Its good news and bad news.\n\n1. The Retirement portion is funded at 105%, overfunded by roughly $13.1 billion.\n2. The healthcare fund is only at 50%, underfunded by roughly $46 billion.\n\nNow, common sense would say that we should pass legislation to allow the USPS to refund that $13.1 billion and instead place it in the helathcare fund.  But even then those promises are badly underfunded - even with the 13 billion, it would only go up to 64% funded.\n\nYou could say that the corporate world assumes 80% is safe and if you would allow to draw down the pension fund to fund the healthcare obligations, we'd be at that.  I'd be okay with that, although I think that standard is something... wrong.  I've always felt that you should fund at 100%; being underfunded puts the workers at far more risk that they won't get what is promised than the company.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1a0i3v", "selftext": "Regardless of the justification provided or mitigating factors; why is the USPS the only federal agency which is saddled with these requirements?

Make people understand why pensions today are simply not viable without significant contribution. The 75-year window isn't entirely outside the realm of private comprehension given the inclusion of PBO in normal pension calculations.

Social Security does not have that money exactly, but rather special treasuries that it purchased from the general revenue fund (what you typically consider the national budget).  Now as it runs a deficit, it is selling those treasuries, meaning the general government is paying those funds back.\n\nThat's a bit of a simplistic view of it, but that's the \"accounting\" that the government uses.  What most people point out is that while that's true under its rules, if it had to report as a consolidated unit (there technically is no \"all-inclusive government report\") the Social Security special revenue fund and the general revenue fund would be considered related parties and would consolidate together.  That would mean all those \"investments\" in Social Security are exactly offset by the liabilities in the other fund.  Which means... there is actually no investment.  It is one pocket of the government owing money to another pocket.\n\nSo what happens when there really aren't any assets?  Well, its current revenue that is paying current benefits.  Or... as I said, workers paying for the retirees.\n\nIf you want, I would *love* to go into explicit detail rather than just glazing over the top.  Government/fund accounting is one of the places that most accountants/CPAs *love* to rail against because it is not necessarily about fair reporting to stakeholders, rather making it easy for politicians to manipulate the numbers.  Ever wonder why the Social Security fund doesn't have a \"pension\" reflecting what it owes citizens?\n\nETA: Let me explain it another way.\n\n&gt;The old people who are now benefiting paid for themselves while they were young.\n\nThe only way for that to be true (that they are not being supported by the young) is for there to be a pile of money somewhere that contains their contributions.  Now, we all know that Social Security's fund itself has no actual funds in it.  Instead, it was used to by investments (US Treasuries) to generate a return.  That's a good idea as it means it makes it easier to meet obligations.  Basically, the pile of money was moved from Social Security to the General Revenue Fund - so the pile of money should be there.  But given that it has debts of $16 trillion, we know that to be false as well.

Right now certain states, Mississippi was commonly used, must get the Justice Department to approve any changes to their voting schemes.  Most other states do not need to do this.
