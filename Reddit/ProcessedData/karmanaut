{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1r5o48", "selftext": "When I worked for the Department of Justice, one of the things that I did was work to get judicial nominees approved. We would get the name of the candidate and information from the White House and then talk to members of the judiciary committee and find out what their concerns were about the candidate, and then research that issue. With that research, we would try to come up with a persuasive argument for why that issue didn't matter for that candidate.\n\nHere's an example.\n\nThere was a candidate for a district court position in a midwestern state. It is traditional for the two senators from the state to have an unofficial veto over that candidate, because (presumably) they are the members of the senate who know that state best and know who would work well there. So, we first approached the office of the (Republican) senator from that state and asked him what he thought of that candidate. His objection was that he didn't think the person was qualified enough to be a judge. So, I research how many years he had spent in private practice and how many years he had spent in public practice, where he had clerked, what law school he went to, what other positions he had held, etc. Then I did the same for every other circuit court judge in that state; overall, our candidate had I think 7 years more experience than the average judge in that state, and 10 years more experience in the public sector (as opposed to private practice). Those numbers may not be entirely accurate as this was a few years ago. So, then, we presented that information to this Senator. A short while (meaning, not enough time to really read over it) later, we got a reply: \"Well, we still don't think he's experienced enough. But now our issue is that he is too extreme.\" So, then we went and did research on that. Repeat ad nauseum. The objections that they posited were pretty clearly (at least in my mind, although maybe I am biased because I did the leg work) disproved, but that didn't matter. The objections were just political proxies. And we all knew it. \n\nThat candidate never got confirmed, and I don't know who ended up taking that seat, but I doubt he was more qualified than the original nominee. He was never put up for a vote, so never officially \"blocked.\" This is more to show that there are huge hurdles to even being put up for nomination, which weeds out a number of good candidates who just don't want to go through this process.

Sarah Palin had virtually no executive experience and legislative clout but hoped to appeal to women, I think her embrace by the south was an unexpected benefit.  Paul Ryan appealed to deficit hawks and hoped to deliver the swing state of Wisconsin, and he again had no executive experience.  Clinton had Gore because Gore was respected in the senate but also because he was from Tennessee.  George Bush Sr. was Reagan's VP as much for his intelligence and executive experience as his roots in Texas, which was until then a blue state and only went red for the Reagan election.

But one of the few times where they are allowed to *not* defend it is when the rule is (in their view) so blatantly unconstitutional that it isn't worth defending; there must be no reasonable argument in favor of the law. [See US v. Lovett](http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0328_0303_ZO.html).

Anyone adversely affected by the decision can contest it. The problem is that *no one is adversely affected by gay marriage*. The people claiming to have been adversely affected are just groups and voters who opposed the measure, and that isn't enough because it isn't a particularized harm. So, if theoretically, you could find someone who suffered a particular harm because gay marriage was legalized, then it could be challenged.\n\nThere is a case (the name of which currently slips my mind) where an IRS provision was found to be unconstitutional, **but** it remained in place because nobody had the ability to challenge it.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "First, let's look at their problems: \n\n1. Shrinking demographic: The GOP did well when the electorate was white, christian, and old. But America is becoming a lot more diverse and they aren't playing so well with minority voters\n\n2. Narrow Geographic focus: The GOP holds the South and the Midwest. But with Obama winning in Virginia and having won NC in 2008, the South is starting to get shaky. Even Texas will become a blue state if demographic trends hold, and the Democrats will be unstoppable with California, New York, and Texas locked up. \n\n3. Class demographics. Normally, the democrats are bad at the labeling game, but they seem to have pulled off a miraculous coup in giving the GOP the title of \"Party of the Rich.\" The truth is that there are rich people in both parties, but as that label becomes more and more ingrained, the GOP will lose more middle class support. Running a ridiculously wealthy candidate in 2012 didn't help much. \n\nAs I see it, these are the main problems that they face outside of individual policy issues. So here's where they go from here:\n\n1. Social issues.\n\nThey're losing ground. Gay marriage, DADT, abortion, etc. So the GOP approach to this needs to be \"Let the states decide!\" Why? Because it allows their population to continue discriminating while not alienating anyone further. It also matches with their \"Smaller federal government\" core ideology. Finally, it allows them to focus on pertinent issues\n\n2. They need to push business issues\n\nBut not in a way that fits the \"we're stooges of big corporations\" message. They need to *actually* push small business needs instead of just using the rhetoric.\n\n3. Providing alternatives\n\nIt's no good to just say \"No\" to everything the Democrats want. When a problem arises (for example, health care) they can't just play defense, because it only adds to the image of partisan gridlock. Just look at the Clinton Era, where the GOP took the lead in proposing a lot of programs, and Clinton was willing to work with them. They tried this with the Paul Ryan budget, but tepid support from a lot of GOP members kind of killed that option. \n\n4. Actually shrinking government\n\nThey talk a lot about it, but when Reagan, Bush 1, and Bush 2 were in office, the government grew every time and budgets swelled. They need to actually walk the walk instead of just talking about it in election cycles. Of course, the requires winning elections again.\n\n5. Campaign Strategy:\n\nThey need energy, and for energy, they need to embrace libertarian ideals and leaders like Gary Johnson and Ron Paul. Marijuana Legalization would be *perfect* for them ideologically (they're anti-regulation, pro-personal freedom, pro-personal responsibility, etc.) But they've dug themselves into a hole with the \"War on Drugs\" rhetoric, and they're afraid to be \"flip floppers\" by walking it back. But, as legalization grows in states (like WA and CO), someone will eventually recognize that the benefits of embracing it outweigh the costs. Now, I'm sure I sound like your average \"legalize it!\" idealist, but I really do think this is the best way for the GOP to modernize and try to win back the youth vote. \n\n6. Foreign Policy:\n\nKick the neocons out. They became popular during the cold war and managed to worm their way into the GOP, and there's no use for them now. Republicans need to become more anti-war than the democrats. I can't see this happening, though, with their \"support the troops\" attitude and the defense-industrial basis being such a major pork product.

Someone (in the far off future) will figure out how to equate the fear of \"Big Government\" and big federal spending with paying for lots of prisons and such.  \n\nI don't think Republicans are going to be supporting state's rights very much in the future.  State referendums like legalizing marijuana and gay marriage have had some success, while state-level attempts on immigration and abortion have been overturned by the Supreme Court.  The ball is definitely on the liberal's side of the court on the subject of states' rights, even though the leader of the federal government is a Democrat now.  Personally, I love states' rights.  I love that we have 50 little laboratories trying out new laws and programs, like Massachusetts with health care, which the federal government might enact if it proves successful.  Liberals really underestimate states' rights.  \n\nFinally, can the GOP get the youth vote?  The Democrats can seem like the party of the AARP, teacher's unions, retired autoworkers, etc.  Right now, opposing gay marriage is a *complete* deal-breaker for 95% of young people, but if the GOP can clean up its act of a bunch of social issues, and grow a strong voice for Social Security reform, I could imagine it picking up traction among young people.  Of course, a lot of other things would need to change for the GOP, and everyone likes Obama too much to jump ship quite yet, but if Social Security and Medicare fights get ugly in the next decade, I could see the Democrats becoming the party of the old people.

A journalist is not a just mouthpiece for information.  That's what a gossip does.  A journalist interprets complex events and simplifies them so they can be conveyed to the largest audience possible.  A journalist **does not mislead, misinform, or lie to the public implicitly or explicitly**, and thus a journalist's credibility comes down to:\n\n- **Do they do their homework?**  Is the journalist knowledgeable about the subject on which they report?  Is the journalist familiar with the interviewee?  Can the journalist corroborrate claims made by a source using other factual sources, on the spot?  Can the journalist refute misleading statements and claims which are not factual due to said familiarity, on the spot?  Can the journalist point to facts which corroborate/refute claims that are easily accessible to the public?  Has the journalist conveyed all of this in simple terms?\n\nIf you answer \"yes\" to all of these questions, the journalist is credible.  If you answer \"no\" to any or all of these questions, then the journalist is not credible and you need to seek alternatives to his or her word.\n\n- **Are they concerned with details?**  Can they decifer and emphasize details critical to a *complete* understanding of the events?  Can they tease out these details from their sources?  Are they consistently factually correct?\n\nIf you answered \"yes\" to these questions, then the journalist is credible.  If \"no\" to any of them, you know what to do.\n\n- **Does your source know facts are not biased?**  Is your journalist unafraid of this label?  Does your journalist relentlessly pursue factual information regardless of where it leads?\n\nYou get the picture.\n\nNow, just about every U.S. news org will present stories as follows:\n\n- \"An intense debate over the shape of the Earth errupted among astrophysicists recently when Alex Bronson announced the Earth is actually a cube, citing two recent studies done by Leading Earth shape organizations.  Head NASA physicist Craig Douglas alledges the Earth is actually a sphere based on evidence he claims was gathered over centuries of research.  Tune in at 10 for live debate coverage.\"\n\nThe idea the Earth is a cube is ridiculous.  It's fucking stupid.  Journalists should not even remotely entertain this kind of thing, yet they routinely feature this kind of \"news\" in the media.\n\nInsert \"climate change\" into that example.  Try \"gay rights\" or \"gun control\" or any current \"debate\" issue.  All of these things have facts which quickly make these issues clear, yet they and other issues are presented as if there are particulars which need to be worked out.\n\nSo, when you see these types of \"reports\" on your news source, they are not credible.\n\nAlso for immediate discredit are organizations which consistently allow \"unnamed sources\" into their journalists' reporting, **especially when reporting in, on, or around the government and/or military.  Do not, under any circumstances, trust these reports.**\n\nPeople love talking to the news.  It's one of the first things you learn as an aspiring reporter.  People fucking *love* facetime.  So if your source refuses to be known, you can find a source that will (probably from your original anonymous source).\n\nIt really isn't that hard.  Don't lie.  Don't let people lie.  Report only facts.  Pursue facts like a bloodhound.  Always get a name.\n\n**Edit**:  \n\n- **Conflicts of Interest**; Is the journalist reporting on something in which he/she has an interest?

For lesser known names, there are a couple of quick ways to judge:\n\n1. **Do they do their homework?** Do they say that their sources reported to them or someone else? Are they constantly linking to other sites for their stories? (I'm looking at you, HuffPo, although there is some good reporting there too). Are their stories simply rehashings of popular news (gun control, the inauguration, Manti Te'o, etc. etc.) or do they have refreshing exclusives and interesting takes on some of the same news? Do their reporters think or simply write? Consider all this.\n\n2. **Are they concerned with details?** Do you spot constant grammatical errors, run-on sentences, unfinished thoughts, paragraphs that are too long? Do you ever see them get basic facts (dates, times, attribution) wrong? If so, they may not be concerned enough with the details, they may  have a crappy editor, or a very understaffed editing team. That can mean they aren't very concerned with the stories coming out, and more concerned about ad money, not the stories.\n\n3. **Are they inherently biased?** There's bias in everything, but everyone should still report the facts. No story headline should seem so far off the mark that it's a different event altogether (ahem, Fox News, TheBlaze, Buzzfeed, though to a lesser extent). Also, check for keywords. If the author is using words like \"liberal media,\" \"secular,\" \"family values,\" \"big government,\" or \"traditional,\" safe to say the writer/publication is probably somewhat conservatively biased. Similarly, seeing words like \"fundamentalist,\" \"separation of Church and State,\" \"_____ rights,\" \"big business/banks,\" or \"military-industrial complex\" means the writer/publication could be liberally slanted.\n\nIt's okay to still read both a conservative or liberal point of view, by the way- in fact it's pretty much impossible to escape it- but knowing their bias beforehand helps the reader to understand what may or may not be credible.\n\n**TL;DR: The news source should do their homework when reporting and that work should come across in the article written, the news source should pay attention to details in their work, and the news source should (hopefully) be not too liberal or conservative.

CaptainObvious highlights some big indicators, but I differ on a few things. First, when it comes to bias: **Every news source is biased.** There is no such thing as objective journalism. A story can be well-researched, well-sourced, well-written, in addition to offering both sides of the argument or presenting different perspectives. But the simple fact that the story gets published indicates that the editors at that news organization feel that it is newsworthy, and most likely, that it fits the narrative that the news organization is pushing. \n\nSo let's go back to how every news source is biased. First, you have to consider that news organizations exist to make money (NPR/PBS and other nonprofit news organizations still have keep donors on and maintain their funding). The profit motive drives coverage - news organizations will run the stories that get them the most listeners, the highest ratings, and the most clicks on the web. \n\nOf course, some news organizations appeal to certain demographics. Fox News and the Wall Street Journal generally target a conservative audience. MSNBC and the New York Times generally target a liberal audience (though I would argue that NYT's reporting is definitely less one-sided, and definitely more fair). \n\nSo every news organization is biased. That doesn't mean that none of them are good - you just have to know what their biases are, and take that into consideration when consuming their news. \n\nBut the biggest thing I look for in determining how reliable a news source is transparency and the ability to admit mistakes. The New York Times does a superb job of being transparent with their corrections, and they will be the first to say it when they get something wrong. I don't expect every news organization to be 100 percent accurate all of the time - we're all human - but it takes a lot of courage for the prestigious news organizations to admit when they are wrong.\n\nTransparency of bias is also a good indicator. Take The Economist and Reason, two libertarian/conservative leaning publications. They are very clear about what their biases are. You know what you are getting when you read them. They do a lot of great reporting and news analysis, and I really respect what they do. \n\nIt's why people get so irritated when Fox News claims to be \"Fair and Balanced\" when it's very clear to anyone who watches FNC that they lean right in their coverage. There's nothing wrong with a news organization having a political bias, I wish they would just admit that they do! \n\nOne more thing to consider: Reliable news organizations do actual reporting. That means interviewing people, digging through documents and databases, going out on the street to see what's happening, and  sometimes even putting themselves in harm's way to get the story. For the most part, outfits like HuffPo and Buzzfeed piggy back off of other people's hard work, arguably rip off their content and put their own spin on it. That's why most journalists (that I know) tend to really not like what they do. In my mind there is still a huge difference between journalists and bloggers. I prefer to read what journalists have to write.

It is a VERY important subject ethically speaking.\n\nThe only valid non-religious arguments against abortion are likely to be based in effectively equating an embryo, fetus, etc. as a human life, or something close to it. Thus, it is important to examine *very closely* the term \"life.\" WhirledWind uses the term \"life\" in two different sentences above, and in each sentence the term life has very different meanings.\n\nFirst sentence, \"life\" means that of an \"individual organism,\" or so he says. What is revealed is a stark misrepresentation of what happens at conception. There is an ovum (egg cell) that is fertilized. The fertilized egg has human DNA and is set on a course to potentially develop into a full-blown human being. But somehow, magically, this is when \"life\" begins for an \"individual organism.\" You can argue every single cell in your body is an \"individual organism\" by this logic, as objectively there is very little distinction to be made between the fertilized cell and any other cell in your body.\n\nSecond sentence, \"life\" seems to be referred to a in a legal sense, and the only reason such \"life\" should be under the jurisdiction of law, vis-\u00e0-vis abortion specifically, is if it were considered \"human life.\"\n\nChibano calls out these clumsy renditions with good reason. I followed suit. Taken to its logical end, the notion that any cell containing human DNA is human life with full ethical implications leads us to be carrying out abortions whenever we type, bite our lip, or shed a hair.\n\nIf they were explaining the biological definition of \"life,\" they were failing miserably.

So, to me, figuring out whether or not a fetus is a person or not is irrelevant to the question.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "First, it is impossible to accurately determine what impact spending had. The study you are referencing [is here](http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/LevittPolicyWatchCongressional1995.pdf), but looked at (1) general election spending, not primary spending, and (2) looked at Congressional races, which have a notoriously low turnover rate for incumbents. Spending doesn't make much difference in those races because the incumbent usually has all of the name recognition and local support that new candidates need the money to get. And of course there are candidates who do have a lot of money that eventually lose. So cash isn't the only key to success, but it is a big one. It is a way of overcoming obstacles that can be overcome in other ways, but those other ways are much less certain and much more difficult.\n\nNow, Citizens United specifically.\n\nFirst: you're right, it doesn't grant corporate personhood. Corporate personhood has been around a *lot* longer. It's basically the idea that for a corporation to function, it needs to have certain rights separate from the rights of individuals. The right to own land and other property, the right to enter into contracts, etc. \n\nIn Citizens United, the court *extended* the idea of corporate personhood by saying that political activism is one of the rights that corporations need to function. Because they are affected by taxes and regulations and other political decisions, the court reasoned that a company should be able to speak up against policies or candidates that threaten their profits, existence, livelihood, etc. So a logging company would be able to campaign against an environmentalist candidate. The same right applies to unions and non-profits, which are other groups of people that are legally organized. \n\nThe decision is based around the idea that the speech is what is protected, not the speaker. It doesn't matter where the message comes from in order to have the message be protected. Now, this is somewhat inconsistent because they simultaneously ruled that foreign corporations couldn't exercise the same rights... but whatever. So the **speech** gets the protection, regardless of whether it comes from an individual or a person. \n\nSounds pretty good, right? More speech is a good thing, eh?\n\nThere are a few criticisms of the decision that I can think of off the top of my head.\n\n1. Corporations don't need the right of speech to function. Corporations are made up of speaking, voting individuals, and it is in the interest of those individuals to speak up in protection of the company. Thus, no need for the company to speak for itself\n\n2. Corporations have advantages that people do not have, like an unlimited life, the ability to be bought and sold, the ability to be created and destroyed at will, etc. Thus, they are able to use the law for their advantages while not having to suffer the disadvantages\n\n3. The law often places restrictions based on the identity of the speaker. For example, lawyers are ethically not allowed to talk to the press in certain circumstances. Courts can issue gag orders. Military members aren't allowed to openly endorse political candidates, etc. So the ruling is kind of inconsistent by saying that it is the speech that matters, not the speaker. \n\n4. Money itself is not speech, it is a way of facilitating speech. So, for example, I have something to say. That is my speech. I buy a bullhorn; that is a way of getting my speech to a larger audience. Money is the same way: just a way of reaching a larger audience. The court has often upheld *time, place, and manner* restrictions on speech. For example, using a bullhorn at 2 in the morning in front of someone's house may be unreasonable. That's not restricting *the message*, it's restricting the *way the message is being spread*. So restricting money is a lower burden than restricting the content of speech.\n\n5. Corrupting influence: the way Citizens United changed the campaign finance system makes donations more like investments. And the larger the donation, the more someone expects that investment to pay off. Now, the court supposedly addressed this by requiring the PACs to not coordinate with campaigns. **Bullshit**.

This post will cover your first point.  \n\nOne of the things that really irritated liberals after the fact was that OWS recieved a lot more law enforcement scrutiny than the Tea Party and similar right-wing movements.  We now know that OWS was treated by law enforcement as a potential terrorist organization, and they used spies and infiltrators to try to dismantle the movement from the inside.  I remember at the protests themselves, there was open and very serious talk about \"agent provocateurs\".  \n\n90% of the movement was adamantly non-violent, and any talk about violence was quickly shushed.  It is important to note that non-violent does not mean that we were organized, peaceful, and law abiding.  OWS believed in civil disobediance and therefore causing disruption and breaking the law was a key strategy.  This gave the police an excuse to corral us, and therefore we did not see ourselves aligned with the police.  There were a few people who said that the police should be treated as part of the 99%, in practice we saw police confrontation and an opportunity to win public support and outrage, so we encouraged it.  \n\nDid the strategy succeed?  It is hard to say.  Public support of OWS was significant, over 70%.  Both OWS and the Tea Party were anti-establishment, which is a message that almost all Americans align with; that is why both movements had high approval ratings.  And there was genuine outrage at police actions against OWS.\n\nHowever, it caused two major issues.  Firstly, it gave the opponents of OWS a clear line of attack: OWS is nothing but naive teenage hippies and they just want to cause commotion.  While this talk is annoying to OWS supporters, I don't think it hurt the movement all that much.  The real problem is that the police were successful in practice.  By the winter of 2011, the bulk of protests outside of New York had been ended by police actions, and everyone went home.

This post will cover your second point.\n\nWould the movement have been better served to adopt specific policy goals and a strategy for implementing them? This is a fantastic question.  In short, I think the answer is yes, but we should acknowledge why OWS did not have clear policies.\n\nOWS was an anarchist movement.  While there were many left-wing and anti-establishment groups represented, at its core were anarchist ideologies about how popular movements should be run.  The core of the protest was a consensus based decision circle associated with the infamous (and in my opinion delightful) \"mic check\".\n\nThe way a mic check works was clever and igneous.  The idea is that one person chooses to talk, and the crowd repeats them, like a chant.  In a large, disorganized crowd, it is impossible to have your voice heard without bullhorn.  In a mic check, the crowd acts as a \"human microphone\" and amplifies what the speaker says.  However, once a crowd loses interest in what the speaker has to say, they will stop repeating them, and another person can step in and become the speaker.  This allows a diversity of opinion to be heard without radical voices dominating the discussion.  \n\nUltimately, decisions are made by consensus within this circle.  OWS had founders (such as NoLogo) but no leaders.  This means that in order to make a statement, it must be based on consensus.  Ultimately OWS (the New York protest) did release a statement of principles that emerged from the decision circle, but it was very delayed.  Such is the nature of consensus democracy-- it is slow.  \n\nI do think that OWS would have been more successful if NoLogo et al had *started* with clear principles, and then revised them within the decision circles at protests.  With a clear statement of what OWS was trying to do and what it stood for, it would have been hard to brand them as either naive hippies or as radical communists.  In practice, 90% of OWS were progressive Democrats or Green party, not communists or true anarchist.  The statement of principles would have made it clear that, in terms of clear policy goals, OWS agrees with what 70% of the American public agrees with.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7pu2up", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357153803", "ups": 7, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I was the PR Director for Occupy Portland.\n\n1. Yes, it would have, but doing so was nearly impossible. The Police in the United States are very well trained, in many senses of the word. Fundamentally, people that largely agreed with us within the police had a \"mode\" their minds went into when in action that was not conducive to considering the merits of a Constitutional argument, or an ethical/moral argument, or even if the protest would benefit them. Secondarily, as has become known now and we knew at the time, the Federal government was greatly involved in pushing Police action and oversight of the process, and not many officers are going to think for themselves when the Feds are poking around.\n\n2. Yes, it would have greatly benefited from this. However, the people involved were enormously disenfranchised. This meant that the group was very, very conscious about both being co-opted by hidden forces (of which several attempts were actually made), and of further disenfranchising the people that actually showed up. These were the most frustrated people, and so many, more than affecting real change, just wanted to be *heard*. There were those such as myself within Occupy that were greatly interested in affecting real change of some kind, but most simply needed to be psychologically comforted that they mattered. They felt that there was literally no point to their existence politically, and that was scary.\n\nSo... the biggest thing that OWS could have done different is had a national infrastructure. We tried to organize inter-occupy communication, but it was nearly impossible. National organization of some kind that could be plugged into would have been both understandable on a practical level, and would have forced down some much needed structure into the local Occupys.\n\nEarly on OWS (in New York) tried to do this, but they did it in a very \"our way or the highway\" approach that actually further fractured national organization. They basically took the position that they did it first, so it belonged to them nationally. People might have gone along with that, but their inter-occupy organization was ad-hoc, and not prepared in advance, so any claim that it could only be organized through them felt a bit contrived. In addition, they received many times the donations most other Occupys did, but didn't reinvest that back into infrastructure for national organization, which would have been the only way to: 1. generate further financial contributions and 2. consolidate the power of all the individual Occupy groups into something that could have been effectively wielded.", "id": "t1_c7px97v", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "JordanLeDoux", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_15tzmv", "id": "t1_c7pxkog", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "level1", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Federal agencies don't usually police politics, they police power.

I attempted to move forward near the line of riot police so that I could talk to the people in charge (who I knew on a first name basis at that point) so that I could learn why the emergency order had been issued and who had issued it.\n\nThey ignored me however and after 15 minutes I gave up and turned to leave. The entire time the police had been directing people over a speaker system to leave the park in a peaceful and orderly fashion.

Occupy moved the ball forwards on a number of issues -- it's not a trivial victory that, in the months after Occupy started, House Republicans actually started to talk about economic equality as something serious. Occupy may not have forced any real change, but they did flag serious issues that are now getting serious consideration, in a more real way than they did before. \n\n(Note that, despite electing a few congressmen and attaining wider visibility, the Tea Party hasn't been any more successful than that.)\n\nThat said, there are a number of things that should have been done differently to maximize impact, but they're all problems inherent in a quasi-anarchic movement.\n \n* Occupy needed a leader who could talk to the press.\n\n* Occupy needed a leader who could define specific goals.\n\n* Occupy needed to advertise those goals.\n\n* Occupy needed a leader who could keep out the riff-raff -- i.e., people who just went to Zuccotti Park to smoke weed, commit crimes, or otherwise be creepy. I walked through/by Zuccotti commonly, and anyone who was there knows where that group was (towards the back, by the WTC). That made the movement all-too-easy to villify. Occupy also lost cohesion once it was infected by communists, Paul supporters, and anti-Semites (see below). \n\n* Occupy needed to excise any outright allegiance with atheism, Marxism, communism, and true socialism (state ownership of the means of production). This is not a society ready to toss out The System. This is a society ready to reform the system. Outright revolution is justly ridiculed. \n\n* Occupy did a good job cleaning up the park, and making the space livable. But they needed to do better. They lost support from the neighbourhood once the near-24-hour-drum-circle started up. Seriously, many of my friends living within a few blocks had to wear earplugs to sleep, for months.

The leadership, the brass of the police are in all likelihood not part of the %99. Especially if you are top brass in a large city like Toronto, or Chicago. The brass at the police level have a vested interest to collude with politicians that sell out the interest of the public at large to the banks that concentrate wealth among themselves. In North America banks buy politicians and the police brass are merely politicians themselves.\nIn Mexico drug lords have to buy off police chiefs to assert their power. They target leaders who command the loyalty of their sub ordinates. The same thing happens here except as I said the violence which the police represents is monopolized through the economic power that our Governments command. They tolerate an extended level of crime that is limited to race, economic class and gender. There are a lot more poor ass pot heads in jail over rich ones. Poor people pay up the ass in interest and fees while wealthy individuals avoid transaction costs. But I digress.\n\nMy idea is to reinstititute the aspect of decentralized civil upheavel directed at the polices leadership. This means disseminating information about wealth and income within the ranks of the top brass. People must be prepared to resist the might of front line riot police over sitting in one contained area. This means Occupy needs to gain control of Government needs non violently but quickly. Not marches but actual over running of ministry offices. City hall and police stations. Casualties will be sustained but the leadership will be embarrassed. It will garner the attention from the oppressives and the media. They will call out against occupy for being aggressive but then non academic leadership within the ranks can with conviction declare that occupy is only asserting their interests in a non violent manner to reveal that politicians are the same at any level. Occupy can only establish credibility and legitamacy by revealing its oppressors for what they really are. Banks should have been occupied not parks. Thats already paid for by the publics money. Banks being occupied would have sent the message that the bailouts were the peoples money and the banks are being sustained by public money. The %99 leadership was too idealistic and didnt recognize that non violent civil disobediance can only be succesful if it embarrases its opponents.

This was my biggest gripe with Bush, and with fiscal conservatives in general: He came into an office during a huge period of economic boom, and decided that, because we were riding high at the moment, we could both cut taxes and spend at high levels.

The policy should be if you want to live in the country you are welcome.

During this time anyone illegally in the US will be immune from deportation or any ramifications for being in the country. Illegal immigrants must start the process to citizenship during this period. Once they have started the process they will be given a temporary visa for a length of time appropriate for completing the citizenship requirements.\n\nStep 3: After the amnesty period is over strong laws go into place regarding illegals in the country. Illegals will no longer receive any form of aid from the government, companies that knowingly hire illegals will face large fines and loss of business licenses, and it will be illegal to rent or sell housing to illegals.

Not allowing voters to personally select candidates is how you end up with Gordon Brown as your Prime Minister. The British people wanted Labor, but they didn't want him.\n\nWith regards to the Presidential primaries this year, the radicals lost in the Republican Party.

If you can collect a large number of important issues together and support most of them, it gives a candidate a ready base who will vote for them, but gives them great flexibility to talk about other issues. \n\nThis is why we see **movements within parties** that change them considerably. The 'new democrats' of Clinton's era, who have now utterly dominated the previously much more left-wing Democratic party, are an example of this; as are the christian-right republicans. In a multi-party system it is quite likely that both groups would have emerged as a separate party and displaced the Democrats and Republicans respectively. \n\nEven people like Paul Ryan emerged because they had 'fresh' ideas that voters wanted. A primary system works wonders in letting constituents decide how their larger party course-corrects. \n\nOf course, as mentioned, the problem is gerrymandered districts. When orthodoxy is articulated at the national level, it can usually be destroyed by having moderate politicians make the matter a non-issue. \n\nConsider Republicans on tax: the orthodoxy of never raising taxes ever-ever-ever is not some radical new TEA party sentiment, it's a rehash of Grover Norquist and his pledge. \n\nIf you had healthy constituencies, GOP congressmen would be able to strongly dismiss the idea of never raising taxes, making it a non-issue. This would leave primaries free to discuss other issues of merit instead. \n\nBut it is **because** many GOP congressmen live in scarlet-red constituencies that they dare not act in such a way, even if they want to. They will be primaried out, and this means they have to stay the course. \n\nIn short, the only reason the primary system is a problem is because the US refuses to address the issue of gerrymandering. When you have districts that are shaped in bizarre shapes, with several mile strips of land only a few hundred yards across just to include a left or right wing enclave elsewhere, you are creating echo-chambers. \n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_15oczz", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7oauqa", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1356887620", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c7ocpam", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "seeker411", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_15oczz", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430809231, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I agree somewhat with the OP that the US's primary structure makes candidates more radical. While [nickburnin8](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/15oczz/are_there_any_better_ways_of_selecting_candidates/c7oajr0) offers good counterexamples of this, it is important to note that in 2012, Mitt Romney did move to the far right to win the nomination, even to the point of calling himself a \"severely conservative\" governor. The Democratic party, on the other hand, has the super-delegate system for Presidential primaries which in certain ways acts to weed out politicians that are too far to the left. In both the 2010 and 2012 elections, we saw several moderate Republicans (such as Sen. Dick Lugar of Indiana), lose their primary battles because of challenges from the right. This hurt the Republican party by giving otherwise solidly red states to the Democrats in some cases. In other cases, it hurt the entire country because it sent Republicans completely unwilling to compromise to Congress. Further, the current primary system allows for the likes of the NRA and Grover Norquist to bully candidates with threats of primary competition. (Part of the reason Sen. Mitch McConnell is unwilling to play a big role in the fiscal cliff negotiations is because he doesn't want to anger his base and face a primary challenge in 2014.) \n\nnickburnin8 also mentions California's system, and I think it's important to add that beyond the jungle primary system, California also has a non-partisan method by which to define Congressional districts. The combination of the two make races competitive. However, this also has its problems. I'd like to point to the Berman/Sherman race, in which we had two liberals with similar policies running in the same district. \n\nThat being said, I do believe following California's system of both jungle primaries and non-partisan redistricting would be a step forward. It might be even more beneficial to gerrymander specifically to *create more competitive districts*. Competitive races would increase voter turnout as well, and would require both parties to moderate in order to win elections.

Assuming that there is a cap of 10% on out of pocket costs based on income, for a family that difference (between the cost of the insurance and other OOP costs - and 10% of their income) could be substantial. It could end up being a substantial amount of money, especially if there is no mandate and the wage earner(s) is/are self employed but not making a very high income. Because individual health insurance is quite expensive, often several times more expensive than per capita costs in a group plan.

My main concern is that the cost of providing this cap will be huge, so huge it will face battles every year over appropriations. The cap has the potential to be astronomically large because health insurance is very expensive, few Americans pay directly for it or have had the experience of trying themselves to buy it,\n\nI wish that you were right **because so many people need it.** But I just don't see the government as being as generous as a lot of people who boost the ACA seem to think it is. As the hearings were starting for the ACA, the government was representing it in those hearings as a way to save the government money by taking people out of programs like Medicaid and putting them on private insurance. Since I didn't see the government planning on spending a lot more money in those hearings, I saw the government saying this would save THEM money and cure the free rider problem, I think there has to be a gotcha somewhere and its in the costs that are being dumped on both employers and families. Costs that are **much higher than they need to be, just so politicians can avoid taking responsibility** for something that politicians do everywhere else in the world. Address the rising costs of healthcare sensibly.\n\n**4/5 of all American families cannot afford to buy market rate insurance any more, without help, no matter how \"competitive\" it is.**\n\nThe ACA, by RE-arranging the deck chairs on the sinking ship of the private insurance model doomed us to a continued high administrative cost that is in and of itself, worthless. \n\nIt adds no value. As long as we keep that waste, we wont be able to afford healthcare for everybody. As soon as we buy healthcare services as a nation, rather than as individuals, we will save around a third, because our current system is the most expensive in the world because its the most needlessly complicated system in the world..and that change in and of itself makes it possible to pay for it out of taxes and eliminate bills to the end users, the patients.

Making the per month cost much more than 10% of their income?

The language of the law, and more importantly its regulations, are designed to help low-income Americans, those between jobs, those in the Medicare \"donut hole\", and otherwise disadvantaged individuals. That is great for liberal Americans and Democrats in the legislature. However, everything has a price. Insurance companies, Medical device manufacturers, doctors, hospitals, and of course tax-payers will have to foot the proverbial bill.

Conservatives also do not like the tremendous oversight given to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the potential impact on the national debt, and hundreds of more specific points contained in the law. To provide one very specific example (which has been in the news recently), many Republican governors have decided to force the Federal government to run their State's Exchange. This has been written off as an manner of politically distancing themselves from the law. However, what the media has not pointed out is that after 2015, Federal grants given to the States for the Exchanges will stop. The States will be required to ensure that the program is self-sufficient (most government programs are not) by then, and if it is not the State has to pay for the program. \n\nThere is one thing about the Affordable Care Act that simply CANNOT be understated; This is law absolutely massive.

Money immediately flowed out of the market, and the total capital gains collections in 1985, '86, and '87 were $26B, $52B, $33B respectively. This lull coincided with increased effective taxation of capital gains, but a severe decrease in capital gains to tax. *This implies that people hide their money from taxation*.\n\nIn 2001, when the first round of \"Bush Tax Cuts\" came about, new flat-taxation rules were put into effect on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends. These tax rates didn't change the rates for \"day traders\", but *did* encourage long-term investment as compared to the previous policy.\n\nWhat these numbers mean, is that capital markets can't be \"intelligently\" taxed for maximum revenue. Furthermore, intending to make taxes collected from capital gains a significant contributor to overall revenues is unwise as they're extremely volatile.

They all lose far more than their ruling class gains, and even they realize it.\n\nThats how America got its start in the 19th century, when the governments of Europe occupied themselves with hundred years wars between petty monarchs all related to one another through incestuous family pairings, the result was that many of their smartest citizens invariably voted with their feet and left them for more hospitable shores, abroad.", "id": "t1_c7l9k23", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c7l9s7c", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1579mc", "selftext": "Just combine many processors - link them together with extremely fast interconnects.", "id": "t1_c7l9wzq", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c7l9s7c", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430755910, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7l9wzq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1356313843", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Did it sound like I was saying it would stifle it, I never meant that, I just think that to exclude such a large number of people because we are too greedy to educate people or give them the space to survive out of greed when it really would be so easy to do so, that would be a very huge and terrible mistake in the context of such rapidly increasing and easily shared abundance.

Only House Reps were directly elected; Senators, Justices, and the President were chosen. Electors were chosen in whatever way the state wanted, so it gave the States some power over the composition of the federal government (which has gone by the way side). But there are still some arguments in favor of it:\n\n1. Requires appealing to all sorts of audiences. Under a popular vote scenario, someone could be *very* popular in one region (like the South) and only *mildly popular* elsewhere, but they would win the election because they dominate that one region. \n\n2. Gives small states a voice. Wyoming (the smallest state) has 3 electoral votes. CA, the biggest state, has 55. If you're bad at math, that means that CA is about 18x more powerful than Wyoming in the electoral college. But Wyoming's population is 568,158. CA's population? 37,691,912. Again, if you're bad at math, that means that CA's population is **66** times higher than that of Wyoming. What this means is that the electoral college gives small states some voice so that you don't just need to win the big states (or even the big cities) to win the whole thing. \n\n3. Avoids recounts. While this may sound undemocratic, we'd never settle our elections if it was by popular vote, because *anywhere* could be contested. As it currently is, usually only a few places in swing states end up being contested, but if every vote counted equally, than we might need to recount over and over again, all over the country. That leads to uncertainty and paralysis in the system.\n\nThe real reason it won't be overturned is because the electoral map always favors one party or another at certain times, and when it favors a party they have no reason to try and change it. Democrats currently love the electoral college because they've turned some red states and have a good chance of keeping them blue. \n\nYou should also read about [this proposed law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact) which would essential guarantee popular voting while keeping the electoral college in place.

They are supposed to be impartial, to look at the word s on the page and figure out what they mean in a given circumstance (this is not a plug for literal interpretations, merely a pithy explanation of their job).  No matter what happens, someone's gonna be unhappy, otherwise they wouldn't be needed.  Everything I've just said, really is the way it has to be.\n\nThey have to be allowed to be impartial.  Just.....have to.  Protecting the rights of those targeted by illegal laws is, in my personal opinion, their most sacred trust, but they have other sacred trusts, among them preventing people from changing the rules to suit their own ends, like when there's a contract dispute.  If the parties disagree, you can't have one of them decide well, it \"really\" means so and so.  That's a step toward unraveling the rule of law.\n\nBut there's a problem.  Judges are people too, and sometimes bad ones get in.  Sometimes judges with a political opinion get in, and then they aren't unbiased and impartial anymore.  That's already happened on the USSC, in my opinion, and I don't think I'm being biased.  Well you say, that's what higher courts are for.  Yeah, sure, but like I said.....Supreme Court.  That's the problem: you give people that level of power, and it can be abused.\n\nBut the alternative is worse.  Instead of the occasional destructive judge, the courts would devolve into another political branch.  That alternative is far, far worse.  So no, electing judges is a monumentally horrible idea.  If people could be trusted to separate these things in their minds, maybe, but you have people that have no idea what the courts actually do, and only know politics.  That's scary, the thought of giving them electoral power over judges.  Florida almost had a bloodbath because of our own wrongheaded process which, while not as bad as having elections where it's judge vs. judge, is just as bad, and worse in some ways. (Every 6 years, each judge has a retention vote.  If they lose the vote, the governor appoints new ones.) \n\nNow your first question.  All this is not really answering it, because I don't have one.  Yeah, lifetime appointment removes politics, but it also removes the ability to get rid of truly horrendous judges.  And things like senility?  Who decides when that is appropriate?  It's an inherent problem with, well, humanity: who watches the watchers?  And the the watchers of the ones who watch the watchers?  Ad infinitum.  It's a problem; I don't deny that.  But I think the alternative is worse.\n\nI think there needs to be a ridiculously strong vetting process that keeps badness to a minimum.  I think that this process has to make certain, to the extent possible, that only the best, most impartial are installed.  That only those that are always forthright enough to recuse themselves, and step down when they're too old, etc. etc., are seated on the bench.  That process exists......sorta.\n\nExcept today it doesn't; not really.  Judicial appointments are just as politicized and divided as everything else.  Appointments are just more political footballs, judges are openly described by everyone but themselves, and some times even by them, as being right or left wing.  In short, Congress cannot be trusted anymore.  One thing we could do is raise the requirement to a supermajority of Senators, so that any issue that invokes partisan bickering will tend to disqualify a judge.  Only the very, very, very, VERY most unbiased people, those whose very bearing and demeanor reeks of fairness and impartiality, only they could make it through, because anyone who stood against them would look like a complete asshole.  Basically like objecting to putting Mother Teresa in charge of a charity outfit; you object, you look to be a petulant child.\n\nBut Congress doesn't mind looking like petulant children.  There may not be anyone in the world that could rise to that standard.  And no one cares enough to make any of it happen; no one with power, anyway.  If a judge wrote an opinion that makes one side sad, that side will just block their nomination, and scream about it.  The side that wins will only win by whatever majority they have, which means that the judicial appointment process is reduced again to a partisan decision.  Not to mention that the initial appointment is made by the President, a partisan official, but I'll let that slide, because someone has to do it.\n\nThe only way to fix any of this for enough people to start complaining and voting.  Except, that may not even work, because *you only get one vote*.  If you make your vote about a single issue, you are forfeiting all your other ones.  If you find a candidate that supports a significant portion of your views, that's basically all you can do.  Of course, if no one does, then I guess you're fucked.\n\nSorry for the exposition; I guess my tl;dr is lifetime appointment (both) are vital for an impartial judiciary, or as impartial as we can get it.  Sometimes judges go rogue, and that sucks, but it's better than the alternative.  And good luck changing it.  The system's stack against the change that's needed.

One is to manufacture them in Detroit, and the other is to grow them in Iowa.  Everybody knows about the first technology; let me tell you about the second.  First, you plant seeds, which are the raw material from which automobiles are constructed.  You wait a few months until wheat appears.  Then you harvest the wheat, load it onto ships, and said the ships eastward into the Pacific Ocean.  After a few months, the ships reappear with Toyotas on them.\n\n&gt; International trade is nothing but a form of technology.  The fact that there is a place called Japan, with people and factories, is quite irrelevant to Americans\u2019 well-being.  To analyze trade policies, we might as well assume that Japan is a giant machine with mysterious inner workings that convert wheat into cars.\n\n&gt; Any policy designed to favor the first American technology over the second is a policy designed to favor American auto producers in Detroit over American auto producers in Iowa.  A tax or a ban on \u201cimported\u201d automobiles is a tax or a ban on Iowa-grown automobiles.  If you protect Detroit carmakers from competition, then you must damage Iowa farmers, because Iowa farmers are the competition.\n\nIf American car-making jobs are sent to Asia, it is because Americans can produce good worth more than a car in the time it would take to build a car. Similarly, if American wheat-growing jobs are outsourced to Asia, it means we can produce goods more than a ton of wheat in the time it takes to grow one ton of wheat. Otherwise, we'd stop doing whatever we are doing and grow wheat or build cars. \n\nThat is why no one grows oranges in Russia. Instead, oranges are grown in Florida and exchanged for, let's say, vodka. Outsourcing is not an ill to cure; merely a byproduct of workers picking the better paying job. \n ", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7jcgn4", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1355963803", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_154f5j", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c7jd9ha", "parent_id": "t3_154f5j", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1435655977, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'll leave the \"should they\" question aside for the moment, but the \"What could it do?\" answer is pretty simple:  Tariffs.

First and foremost is how the perceptions of the (R) party change over the next 2 years.  If they are still seen as the party of the rich, then they will have the same problems that plagued them this cycle, only moreso, because they don't learn.  If they clean up their image though, then they have a chance at being competitive.  This means more than just their party-of-the-rich attitude, but also their positions on popular issues like women's rights and immigration.  We'd all like to think gun control will also play a role in light of recent events, but 2 years is a long time.\n\nNow, that said, let's think about how them agreeing to higher taxes will affect them.  The Tea Party will of course abandon anyone who agrees to it, and in many cases will put up a primary challenger.  However, if the (R) party has moved back toward the center on other issues, cleaned up their image, they will reclaim many independents that they have alienated with their positions, taxes being the leading one.  So, ideally, those reclaimed independents would vote the Tea Partiers down.  It goes without saying that if the (R) party remains extremist, there won't be TP primary challenges, but there will be a bloodbath come the general election.\n\nThe problem is that even if the party does clean up it's image, primary challengers are still a huge problem.  That's because only the most passionate politically involved, and in many/most cases *only Republican* voters, will vote in primaries.  That means TP'ers will be disproportionately represented, and will excise any hints at moderation or tax increases or, you know, sanity, from the (R) ranks.

There will also be a federal election in 2014, and in any given week there is likely to be some sort of local election somewhere in the nation.  All that said, this is a matter of making a trade.  To support any sort of tax increase, the Republican Party will be alienating two groups -- long term plutocratic supporters including many big time fundraisers and the energetic new blood that Tea Party organizations provide.\n\nHowever, getting some distance from those two constituencies may not really be that problematic.  After all, the upside would be a reach toward the political center.  Republican members of Congress would have more latitude to vote their consciences rather than link arms and stand firm against every effort to promote American progress.  They would also have more freedom to dissent from party leadership in selective ways (for example, renouncing cruel anti-immigrant policies in order to win re-election in a district with a large Hispanic population or taking a pro-choice stance in front of a constituency that is well-educated.)\n\nCertainly the 2016 primaries will see some Grover Norquist ally ranting and raving about the evils of taxation if there is much Republican support for tax increases in the years ahead.  Those years will see intense struggle between Republicans who are sick and tired of a party that childishly regards tax cuts as a magical panacea vs. Republicans who are sick and tired of a party that egregiously offends women, ethnic minorities, social spending recipients, scientists, non-Christians, etc.  To remain viable, they will either have to ditch their 19th century values or replace half-witted frauds like Paul Ryan with much more credible economic thinkers.  Lacking strong national leadership, the party is unlikely to be decisive in its approach to modernization until the two approaches clash in the 2016 primaries.\n\nAs far as the general election goes, a Republican Party that generally supported tax increases can expect less financial support and only a little more popularity.  Unless the Democratic nominee is incredibly weak or gets hit with scandal just before election day, the only real campaign issues will involve stoking irrational fears and hatreds.  That drives the voting behavior of Fox News fans, but it actively repulses some of the majority who do not drink that particular Kool-Aid.  On the other hand, if the 2016 Republican candidate is furious about taxation while taking a much more moderate tone on issues like immigration, reproductive rights, and civil rights; given that less than 1% of voters have a coherent grasp of macroeconomics, they could find their popular appeal growing rather than shrinking.\n\nAs I review this analysis, I find it credible.  Alas, that means the smart move for the country (some top end tax increases) is not in the best interests of the Republican Party.  Of course, they could go along with tax hikes now, then still field a Presidential candidate who vehemently renounces those taxes and campaigns on some idiotic (yet strangely popular) scheme like a flat tax or replacing income tax with a national sales tax.

I think what you're likely to see is an increase in \"challenges from the right\" to any Republicans who agreed to higher taxes, and some of those would lose in what is an increasingly partisan primary electorate. The problem for Republicans right now is that these \"out-flanking\" primary challenges tend to produce more extreme candidates for the general election, which could lead to some losses in the House. I don't see a large shift towards Democrats in the House in the mid-terms, because history shows us the President's party almost always loses in his 2nd-term midterms (it's just the nature of the beast), but their lead could shrink a little more if hyper-partisan nominees made it through in more moderate districts.\n\nGerrymandering has eliminated the threat of this somewhat, at least for the next 10 years. Looking at the states that voted for Obama by pop vote, you can see that many of them have Republican representation at the House and State Legislature levels, Florida being one example. In this way, the parties in power (mostly Republicans right now, but they're hardly the only ones at fault) have ensured that their power will remain. Even a challenge from the right in a hard-right district wouldn't necessarily result in the loss of a seat.\n\nWhat the ramifications are if more partisan Congressmen make it in, Lord only knows.

Originalism is the idea that we should use the definitions that the founding fathers used in order to understand the constitution. For example: the 8th amendment (no cruel or unusual punishment) is very vague. What is \"cruel\" and \"unusual\". Back then, being imprisoned for not paying debt was common. Now it is cruel and unusual. Our ideas of it have changed, so why would it make sense to use the same definition as the founding fathers? \n\nIt's the same with the term \"militia.\" Back then, every able-bodied male was *the first line of defense*. We had no standing army, so if we were invaded, our military force would be the male population. That's no longer the case; we have a standing army. But: we still do have a \"civilian component\": the reserves and the national guard. The problem is that the Supreme Court still applies the \"Everyone who can hold a gun\" definition, even though our *needs* have changed. Guns are no longer the solution to our problem; they are a problem in and of themselves. Keeping that outdated definition of \"militia\" keeps us from addressing the real problem.\n\nIt would have no affect on the First Amendment, it would simply give flexibility in letting terms in the Constitution be updated for today's problems. In fact, it's a *good thing* for our rights. For example: why is wiretapping illegal? There's nothing in the constitution that says it would be, and in fact, the *originalist* on the court when this issue was first decided said that the government should be able to wiretap you without a warrant. Why? Because he analogized it to simple eavesdropping, and because the Founders had not included \"conversations\" in what is protected under the 4th amendment. \n\n&gt; It seems to me that it's not that everyone can get guns is the problem, I think the bigger problem would be taking away the law abiding citizen's ability to own and posses a gun while a criminal will obtain their weapon anyways via the black market, leaving these citizens at the will of criminals as they hope a cop shows up\n\nI have a few problems with this argument\n\n1. I've never seen any convincing statistic on guns being used for self defense. Sure, it happens sometimes. But does it happen enough to justify the danger of having guns in every home? Not that I can see. \n\n2. There are non-lethal alternatives for self defense and home defense, like tasers and mace. Guns have one purpose: killing. And legally, the use of a gun is automatically considered deadly force, regardless of where you're aiming\n\n3. If this is your justification, then you have no problem banning automatic and semiautomatic weapons, as well has large clips, right? You wouldn't use that for home defense. \n\n4. I am not arguing here that no one should have guns. I am arguing that it should be harder to own a gun. Just like driving a car, there should be strict requirements because of how dangerous it can be. You should be tested, mentally and physically, to determine fitness. \n\n&gt; Or perhaps you think we should do what Australia has done, just destroy the damn things right? \n\nShit, I wish. [Read this about Japan's gun policy](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/07/a-land-without-guns-how-japan-has-virtually-eliminated-shooting-deaths/260189/). You know how many deaths they had in 2006? **2**. Yeah; that's not a typo. In the entire country, in the entire year, 2 people died from guns. I *wish* the US could say that. Instead, we had [30,000](http://www.bradycenter.org/xshare/pdf/facts/firearm-deaths-age-intent.pdf) gun deaths in 2006. \n\n&gt; Again, the black market's existence, to me anyways, makes that the problem. Do you really think that criminals will just turn their gun in to the government?\n\nThe solution to a black market problem isn't to just legitimize that market. Where do you think black market guns come from? From the legal market. The biggest sources of weapons are (1) stolen legal guns, or (2) guns bought from legal sources, illegally, either through straw purchasers or vendors who just don't comply with the law. And then there are gun shows, where you don't need an ID or a background check! \n\nIf weapons sales were restricted today, black market weapons would (1) decrease, even if slightly, and (2) become more expensive, which is a plus in my mind. \n\n&gt;  Lastly, what if, and I really mean WHAT IF, the government after taking away this right decides that now that the people have no means to defend themselves, from criminals or otherwise, that they will just hold a gun up to all of our heads and force us to act according to their will, thus making democracy dead, what then my friend?\n\nAh, yes. The only thing holding back from a dictatorship is guns, right? Look: if the government wants to kill you, they're fucking going to. You owning a handgun isn't going to make a difference when they bomb your house from 50,000 ft. *If* it ever came to a shooting war in the United States, the only thing that would stop the government from obliterating you is the public opinion, and the only way you would keep that on your side is to remain non-violent. The minute you shoot a soldier, you go from \"protestor\" to \"insurgent,\" making you a legitimate target. \n\nLook at Tunisia. [They have the lowest rate of gun ownership in the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country).

Let veterans and national guard members have a right to their guns, and everyone else can be restricted in the manner that Congress sees fit.\n\nThe outdated, originalist sense of the term has been warped. Originally, it may have meant all males between 18 and 45, which is why the Supreme Court has interpreted that to mean pretty much anyone. [If you read the opinion in DC v. Heller](http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/07-290.pdf) they simultaneously adopt and dismiss the original meaning of the term. They say that limiting only to \"organized\" militia doesn't make sense because of how broad the Founders wanted to apply it, yet at the same time, they're (Apparently) willing to extend the privilege to women and old people (who wouldn't be fit to serve in the militia back then, nor would they be eligible for combat duty in *today's* military). That's the problem with originalism: times change, and though we may have a similar policy (defending the nation in the most efficient way possible), our *solutions* for problems are very different. Guns have ceased to be the solution to a problem and have become a problem in and of themselves. \n\nIf I can walk down to a gun show today and walk out with a weapon, how does that make me part of a militia at all? Who says I'll come out and fight if the US is invaded? And in what way am I well regulated? Our current system simply doesn't meet the letter of the law. \n\nAnd finally, to the people who say that that isn't an operative clause : the constitution is very terse. The founder wrote what needed to be in there, and nothing more. If they wanted everyone to have a gun just for the hell of it, they would have said so. Instead, they specifically said that gun ownership rights are for the purposes of establishing a line of defense made up of ordinary people, which is what the National Guard is now.

Just like driving a car, there should be strict requirements because of how dangerous it can be. You should be tested, mentally and physically, to determine fitness. \n\n&gt; Or perhaps you think we should do what Australia has done, just destroy the damn things right? \n\nShit, I wish. [Read this about Japan's gun policy](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/07/a-land-without-guns-how-japan-has-virtually-eliminated-shooting-deaths/260189/). You know how many deaths they had in 2006? **2**. Yeah; that's not a typo. In the entire country, in the entire year, 2 people died from guns. I *wish* the US could say that. Instead, we had [30,000](http://www.bradycenter.org/xshare/pdf/facts/firearm-deaths-age-intent.pdf) gun deaths in 2006. \n\n&gt; Again, the black market's existence, to me anyways, makes that the problem. Do you really think that criminals will just turn their gun in to the government?\n\nThe solution to a black market problem isn't to just legitimize that market. Where do you think black market guns come from? From the legal market. The biggest sources of weapons are (1) stolen legal guns, or (2) guns bought from legal sources, illegally, either through straw purchasers or vendors who just don't comply with the law. And then there are gun shows, where you don't need an ID or a background check! \n\nIf weapons sales were restricted today, black market weapons would (1) decrease, even if slightly, and (2) become more expensive, which is a plus in my mind. \n\n&gt;  Lastly, what if, and I really mean WHAT IF, the government after taking away this right decides that now that the people have no means to defend themselves, from criminals or otherwise, that they will just hold a gun up to all of our heads and force us to act according to their will, thus making democracy dead, what then my friend?\n\nAh, yes. The only thing holding back from a dictatorship is guns, right? Look: if the government wants to kill you, they're fucking going to. You owning a handgun isn't going to make a difference when they bomb your house from 50,000 ft. *If* it ever came to a shooting war in the United States, the only thing that would stop the government from obliterating you is the public opinion, and the only way you would keep that on your side is to remain non-violent. The minute you shoot a soldier, you go from \"protestor\" to \"insurgent,\" making you a legitimate target. \n\nLook at Tunisia. [They have the lowest rate of gun ownership in the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country). But look at what they did: they started the Arab Spring and overthrew an oppressive dictator *because they didn't resort to violence*. \n\nSorry, looks like I got kind of carried away answering that.", "id": "t1_c7hudjb", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "karmanaut", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c7hujkw", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_14z9vv", "selftext": "&gt; Didn't the person in the Newtown shooting actually denied a firearm earlier in the week?\n\nI don't know.

I remember a few years ago when the media were reporting about shark attacks everyday, but to find out that year there were less reported shark attacks that year than the previous years makes me think the media will do anything to get ratings.\n\nOf course it is a huge concern.

The people that do this have more of a problem than just owning a gun.\n\nOf course they have more problems than owning a gun. But owning a gun is what allows them to carry these acts out. Without guns, they would likely find some other way to act out. But the effects of it would be more limited because guns are killing machines, and they're good at it. \n\n&gt; On a side note, is this going to be another circlejerk for r/politics?

The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.\n\nThe debt SHALL NOT BE QUESTIONED. There is a strong constitutional argument that there is no such thing as a \"debt ceiling\". The way the media reports it, people think it's giving authority to borrow more money, when in reality it's money the government has already spent. That is why the credit agencies downgraded the US.

In the US, both roles are filled by the President. In the UK, the Prime Minister is the head of government and the monarch is the head of state. This works well because it allows the Prime Minister to spend all of their time doing actual work while the Queen does a lot of the ceremonial actions. It also allows for a good sense of continuity in the regime; the government (embodied by parliament) may change all the time, but the *State* (embodied by the monarch) remains a constant. This helps maintain national unity and pride; it may not be as big of an issue in the UK, but the King in Belgium is the glue holding the country together. \n\nThere's also a minor role as a \"conscience of the people.\" Basically, if there's something that's very unpopular, the monarch can intervene in some way.

If they split with their party to support the Democrats, that would be the end of their career for almost any member of the Republican caucus.  It's not just that the Republican House leadership would punish them (fewer appropriations to their district, making sure they move up the ranks as slowly as possible), although they would, but any Republicans who split ranks on so prominent an issue would face a primary challenge from another Republican.  And in the next Republican primary, who are the Republicans going to vote for: the Republican who sold out their values, or the challenger calling them out on it?\n\n1. Even if party loyalty weren't an issue, there aren't enough Republicans who would even want to split with Republicans.  Party polarization has become so stark in recent years that the most liberal Republican is more conservative than the most conservative Democrat.  So there just aren't enough votes in the House for the Democratic version of how to resolve the fiscal cliff.  In other words, virtually all (maybe literally all) House Republicans think the Obama approach is objectively a terrible idea.\n\n2. Politics being a zero-sum game, there's always going to be a disincentive from helping the other party win a major victory.  This is one big reason why Republicans have hesitated to support Obama on traditionally Republican ideas like mandate-based universal health care or cap-and-trade to help slow global warming.  They don't want Obama to be popular enough that he'll pass more Democratic initiatives, so they deny him wins where they can.

The more tightly-focused your question, the more likely you are to get an answer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[META] posts are about the state and process of the subreddit; e.g. &amp;quot;[META] We need to talk about downvotes&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;[META] We now have 40,000 subscribers!&amp;quot;; etc. Anyone may make a [META] post.

Top-Tiered Comments&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Top-tiered comments should only be serious responses to whatever the thread is about. If it&amp;#39;s a question, they must be answers; if an AMA, solid questions; if one of the other types, worthwhile points of discussion. In all cases, it is permitted to ask additional questions to clarify the OP&amp;#39;s submission or to follow it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Memes, jokes, insults, or other unhelpful comments are not permitted, though exceptions may be made for jokes if they are only part of an otherwise informative comment. The answers provided in &lt;a href=\"/r/ask_politics\"&gt;/r/ask_politics&lt;/a&gt; should be informed, comprehensive, serious and courteous -- that is, they should be such that a reader would depart feeling as though he or she had actually learned something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sources in top-tiered comments are not an absolute requirement at first if the comment is sufficiently comprehensive, but users who choose to answer questions in &lt;a href=\"/r/ask_politics\"&gt;/r/ask_politics&lt;/a&gt; must take responsibility for the answers they provide. If you are asked for sources or further substantiation, you are required to make a good-faith effort to find and provide them. This subreddit&amp;#39;s entire point is to answer questions that are set before you; if you are not prepared or inclined to substantiate your claims when asked, please think twice before answering in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Partisan bickering and name calling is not welcome in this subreddit. If you came here to score political points or to parrot unsourced talking points, your comments will be removed. Repeat offenders will be banned. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;II(b). Non-Top-Tiered Comments&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Comments that are not in the top-tier are less restricted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Non-top-tiered comments should still have a positive purpose -- if they exist for no other reason than to insult someone they will still be deleted. Nevertheless, non-top-tiered comments have greater scope for jokes, digressions and so on, and will be moderated with a somewhat lighter hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;II(c). On Speculation&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We welcome informed, helpful answers from any users equipped to provide them, whether they have flair or not. Nevertheless, while this is a public forum it is not an egalitarian one; not all answers will be treated as having equal merit. Please ensure that you only post answers that you can substantiate, if asked, and only when you are certain of their accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is perfectly acceptable to ask a follow-up question of your own if you aren&amp;#39;t sure about something, or wish to generate further discussion, but please make sure to frame your comment explicitly in those terms if so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;II(d). Posts from Novelty Accounts and Bots&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bots will be banned on sight, no matter how benign. We are not interested in &amp;#39;em.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Users may post from novelty accounts provided they do not do so &amp;quot;in-character.&amp;quot; This applies both to accounts with a particular gimmick (only posts one word, gradually revealed to be something, etc.) or accounts intentionally modeled upon famous persons. In-character posting will result first in a ban.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;III. Flair&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flair is for users with an extensive knowledge of a given topic area. Until categories of flair are established, we will essentially allow experts to pick what text their flair will display. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;III(a). Applying for Flair&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To apply for the flair, simply message the moderators &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAsk_Politics\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and ask. In order to be flaired, you must prove that you currently are or have formerly worked in the field of politics, or that you have studied it academically. Acceptable proof would include ID badges or paystubs, degrees or other certificates, etc. Anything that proves your claims. All proof sent to the moderators will remain 100% confidential, under any circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;III(b). Flaired Expectations&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Users with flair must have two things:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An extensive knowledge of their topic area, with the ability to cite sources on anything they say in that topic area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to convey their personal knowledge and experiences in a way that is understandable to a person unfamiliar with politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flaired users are held to a higher standard. They must be polite, helpful, and comprehensive in every comment they make. They are permitted to answer questions outside of their area of expertise, but they will be treated just like any other user when they do so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flaired users who fail to meet the above expectations should be reported to the moderators.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;III(c). Non-Flaired Expectations&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We welcome the participation of non-flaired users so long as it conforms to all of the above rules. It is especially important for us to allow such participation given that it is one of the chief ways in which we can find out which non-flaired users should be given flair at all. Nevertheless, pay special attention to the strictures provided above when it comes to sources and speculation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;III(d). Conduct for All Users&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regardless of flair, all users are expected to behave with courtesy and charity. We also have a very low tolerance for racism, sexism, or other forms of bigotry, no matter your credentials.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IV. Discipline&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those who break the rules outlined above will likely find themselves under scrutiny. Disciplinary actions on the moderators&amp;#39; part come in three forms:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gentle reminders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formal warnings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bannings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gentle reminders will see a moderator suggesting you shift your tone, improve your posting style, or what have you, but without any suggestion of the matter being especially severe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Formal warnings will be delivered for especially grievous infractions, and are marked by their inclusion of a serious, declarative command; e.g. &amp;quot;Do not post like this again.&amp;quot; Users who receive multiple warnings will likely be banned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bannings are reserved for users who:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commit multiple infractions in spite of warnings and correction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respond with hostility and rudeness to attempts to warn them (**note: this does not mean you can&amp;#39;t respond at all; we&amp;#39;re quite open to being asked why warnings or reminders have been handed out -- just be courteous about it!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are clearly trolls&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engage unrepentantly in racist, sexist, or otherwise bigoted behaviour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are spammers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are bots -- even relatively benign ones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IV(b). Appeals&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If one of your comments has been wrongfully deleted, or if you feel you have been wrongfully banned, you can message the moderators either individually or as a team to explain your situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These rules are subject to change at any time, though such changes will be publicly announced. Questions should be directed toward the mod mail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, any immediate comments are welcome below.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And a big thank you to &lt;a href=\"/r/AskHistorians\"&gt;/r/AskHistorians&lt;/a&gt;, from which we shamelessly stole these rules.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I.

Disciplinary actions on the moderators' part come in three forms:\n\n* Gentle reminders\n   \n* Formal warnings\n    \n* Bannings\n\nGentle reminders will see a moderator suggesting you shift your tone, improve your posting style, or what have you, but without any suggestion of the matter being especially severe.\n\nFormal warnings will be delivered for especially grievous infractions, and are marked by their inclusion of a serious, declarative command; e.g. \"Do not post like this again.\" Users who receive multiple warnings will likely be banned.\n\nBannings are reserved for users who:\n\n* Commit multiple infractions in spite of warnings and correction\n\n* Respond with hostility and rudeness to attempts to warn them (**note: this does not mean you can't respond at all; we're quite open to being asked why warnings or reminders have been handed out -- just be courteous about it!)\n \n* Are clearly trolls\n\n* Engage unrepentantly in racist, sexist, or otherwise bigoted behaviour\n\n* Are spammers\n\n* Are bots -- even relatively benign ones\n\nIV(b). Appeals\n\nIf one of your comments has been wrongfully deleted, or if you feel you have been wrongfully banned, you can message the moderators either individually or as a team to explain your situation.\n\nThese rules are subject to change at any time, though such changes will be publicly announced. Questions should be directed toward the mod mail.\n\nIn the meantime, any immediate comments are welcome below.\n\nAnd a big thank you to /r/AskHistorians, from which we shamelessly stole these rules.", "likes": null, "link_flair_text": null, "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_14m18a", "id": "t1_c7eecqr", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_14m18a", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430635354, "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7eecqr", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1355171448", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_14m18a", "id": "t1_c7efwy3", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "hygo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Hey, they're good rules.

First, whether the Grutter test is still valid. The Texas model was designed explicitly to mirror what the Supreme Court said was acceptable there. If they rule that that isn't ok, then they're going to force a whole lot of universities to redesign their policy.\n\nSecond, whether this is the least burdensome means of increasing diversity. The Texas case is unique because they don't just have the race-conscious affirmative action program, but also the 10% rule: if you're in the top 10% of your high school class, you get in automatically. This program has gone a long way toward increasing diversity, so Fisher is obviously arguing that this is a facially neutral law that works *better* than the race-based one that they also have now.\n\nThe third issue is the \"sunset clause\" and whether Texas has achieved \"enough\" diversity, which is hard to put a finger on. I think Michigan's goal was 15% minority enrollment; Texas is already above that. But, I find that to be a disingenuous argument because Texas as a state is way more diverse than Michigan. So the question is whether 15% would apply for all states, or if it should be based off of that state's demographics. In the Grutter decision, they say that the day would come when affirmative action is no longer needed, but they don't specify when that would be. So Fisher will argue that Texas has reached that point. \n\nIn my opinion, the court will rule against Texas but only on the grounds that they have another better means of increasing diversity while not explicitly choosing based on race.

It used to be the case that there were plenty of liberal (mostly northern) Republicans, and plenty of conservative (mostly southern) Democrats.  So, depending on the makeup of a given Congress, either a liberal or a conservative bill could pass with plenty of bipartisan support.\n\nAlthough the parties have trended towards ideological consistency for decades now, it was only in the past few years that, for the first time, the most liberal Republican was more conservative than the most conservative Democrat.  So what you've seen is a decreasing capacity to find bipartisan support for legislation.\n\nI should add that there are plenty of other potential culprits, and it's hard to say how much each affects bipartisanship.  Off the top of my head, I can think of two more:\n\n1. Members of Congress used to live in DC and only go back to the districts during a recess.  Now Congress will frequently work Tuesday through Thursday, and members spend weekends back home in the districts.  Some have speculated that it was easier to work together on bills and harder to demonize each other when members would see each other socially (at dinner, at kids' Little League games, etc.).\n\n2. The parties have discovered that they do better electorally when they adopt essentially a permanent campaign.  The old line about the Senate is that, in a six-year term, a senator spends two years as a statesman, two years as a politician, and two years as a candidate.  Now, it seems they're at least a politician the entire time.  It's harder for give-and-take negotiations when you're trying to demonize your opponent every single day.\n\nAlso, the Clinton administration wasn't exactly the high-water mark of bipartisanship either.  One of George W. Bush's stump speech lines in 2000 was that, having been Governor of Texas and not in Washington, he had no stake in all the bitter dischord of the Clinton years.  Regardless of who's right in all this, that kind of comment shows that it was taken for granted that Washington in 1999-2000 was coming off years of bitterness.

It makes sense.\n\nIt's also farcically incorrect - while the author correctly applies the DW NOMINATE algorithm in a single instance, he only demonstrates it zeroed to a single year, which is not how the Keith Poole dataset is constructed.  The Poole dataset compares the adherence of politicians to a fixed slate of issues over time in their voting records, allowing one year to be compared to another.  If it were constructed as the RCP author constructs his 1938 dataset, that is, by coding the members relative to each other, it would show no deviation in its mean over time: it would be zeroed to maintain a constant average.\n\nImagine, for a moment, that I were to make a chart comparing the relative prices of Coke and Pepsi over time, and imagine further that the price of Pepsi was progressively increasing while the price of Coke was constant.  Now, I'm a somewhat green statistician out to demonstrate that the gap between the two is equally attributable to Coke decreasing in price relative to Pepsi as much as Pepsi is increasing in price relative to Coke.  (An absurd claim, clearly, but bear with me.)  To that end, I arrange my data points with n = year on the horizontal axis, and place the prices of Coke and Pepsi in a scatter plot on the y.  So far so good.  \"But,\" I say, \"this doesn't demonstrate the equal culpability of those scurrilous price-cutters in Atlanta!\"  In a flash of inspiration, I *average* the price of Coke and Pepsi for each n and transform my data, point by point, so that the divide between Coke and Pepsi is presented centered, on an arbitrary -1 to +1 scale.\n\nThe result is completely meaningless, of course, but it looks all science-y and stuff, and I can talk up the growing gap between Coke and Pepsi as a 'fact' out of context on the morning shows.  In case you haven't guessed by now, this is essentially what the RCP article does: it (incorrectly) claims that the correct way to apply DW NOMINATE is to redefine the issue parameters each year.  If you do that, you'll do a decent job of showing how far apart the parties are, but you're throwing out a lot of information on where they are relative to where they started.  \n\n&gt;WHAT percentage of academia is liberal again? Do you HONESTLY believe they are teaching in an unbiased fashion? They weren't when I was in college in the 90's.\n\nActually, given the prevalence of economists in the field, most public policy departments lean rather to the libertarian-right of the rest of their universities.  Of course, that would still look rather to the left from your perspective, but that's more an issue with the way your particular frame of reference has clouded your conception of the political \"center.\"  You know how the phrase \"cap and trade\" [elicits paroxysms of revulsion](https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=cap+and+trade+fox+news&amp;oq=cap+and+trade+fox+news&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) whenever it's mentioned on Fox News?  It may surprise you to learn that that sort of market-based approach has its origins on (what used to be) the American political *right* - HW Bush used it to great effect to curb NOx and SO2 emissions, and it still enjoys enormous popularity with the public at large.  That that wasn't enough to stop the Waxman-Markey Bill from being blocked by the GOP and conservative Blue-Dog Democrats should tell you all you need to know about where Congress stands relative to the political center.  Academics adopting positions out-of-step left of the Congressional mean does not constitute political bias.\n\nMore importantly, though, whatever one's personal political sentiments may be, professional practice in academia requires that you base your inquiries on a slate of experimentally and observationally supported premises (what you might, in layman's terms call \"facts\") and ensure that whatever conclusions you draw conform to an overall schema that we in the business like to call \"reality.\"  If you find that the academic conception of reality differs from your own, therefore, I would suggest that the best response might not be to raise a hue and cry, but rather to consider whether your own position is as firmly grounded.\n\n&gt;Explain to me the purpose of Rhode Island's voter ID laws, won't you?\n\nRhode Island is an unusual case, in that its voter ID laws were driven by African American, Democratic lawmakers.  Their reasons for doing so are unlike the reasons driving GOP voter ID efforts, being grounded very much in local politics - in particular a rather lurid moral panic about supposed Hispanic political fraudsters.  Rhode Island, in short, doesn't really prove much of anything, save that [African Americans are capable of being racist too.](http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/100429/rhode-island-voter-id-laws-hispanic)  We knew this already, [of course.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6RbfaoX5Hw)\n\nEverywhere else, of course, [Republicans have been nothing if not frank about what they see as the purpose of voter ID.](http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/early-voting-curbs-called-power-play/nTFDy/)\n\n&gt;Would you consider the poli-sci community to be liberal or conservative?\n\nSee above - they tend to be slightly conservative on economic issues, more than a little liberal on social issues, and *real hard-liners* on factual issues.\n\n&gt;I can see that you want to make it impossible.\n\nLook: you're entitled to your opinions, but God help us, you're not entitled to your own facts.  We already went through the Enlightenment once, thank you very much; we don't need to waste any more ink on the necessity of systematic observation and external consistency.  When it comes down to it, there is no Great Socialist Conspiracy, there is no Homosexual Agenda, Feminists are not turning our daughters into witches, and there is no War on Christmas.  Moreover, the Earth is not flat, the solar system is heliocentric, tides are caused by the moon, Snape kills Dumbledore, and the Democratic Party would be considered centrist-to-center-right anywhere else in the Western world.

(After all, it's not like there's anybody else for a liberal to vote for.)  \n\nThat is, Democratic politicians *and* Republicans on the whole are more conservative than ever.  The real question is whether the far-right will collapse as its base declines demographically before a credible leftist alternative to the Democratic party appears.  (The first is more likely, but it'll probably take a generation or two for its effects to become apparent.)\n\nReagan's landslide victory, meanwhile, was the product of a number of factors.  First and foremost, there was widespread dissatisfaction with the Carter administration.  Between Iran, the Oil Crisis, and the antics of his brother, there was plenty to make fun of.  Second, there was the anomalous character of the Carter ticket - a Democrat, from the Deep South.  In many ways, he was an anachronism; by that point the New Deal Coalition was already starting to fragment, and the Republican Southern Strategy was peeling more Southern Democrats off each year.  The DNC wasn't prepared, and they didn't yet have an effective response to this strategic shift, so a charismatic candidate like Reagan caught them flat-footed.    \n\nOverall: the NOMINATE scores don't lie.  As Congress becomes more polarized, that polarization is driven by right-wing politicians become more right-wing and left-wing politicians rubber-banding more slowly to occupy positions clustered around the opposite pivot.  (Read Krehbiel for more.)  The Democratic Party, meanwhile, has a demographic problem of its own.  Although it has strong leads among the young, the female, and the non-white, it still has some difficulty exploiting those.  Even if there were left-wing media operations with a similarly honed ability to get an emotional response and support for their positions as that of Fox News (and there isn't), it's just plain easier to dissuade a single mom working two part-time jobs from voting than it is to keep retirees away from the polls.  There's a difference both in motivation and in negative incentives to be dealt with.  Also, strong Republican performances in state-level redistricting allow them to multiply their influence in the House of Representatives.

In return, he conformed his platform to Fox's message (even at the cost of contradicting his earlier position or positions) and favored appearances on Fox over appearances on other networks to a stunning degree.\n\nIf the 90s were the decade of Gingrich, the 2000s so far have been the age of Fox News.

The trucking sector has already begun transitioning their fleets from ULSD to CNG or LNG to save on fuel costs, and the trucks run cleaner. Furthermore, America is the global leader in NGV engine production. Policies that diversify our fuel away from gasoline and diesel to cleaner emissions are in our best interest and *they need no subsidies*.\n\n3. Raise taxes on domestic oil sales.

Continue the creep of CAFE standards for more fuel efficiency.\n\n6. Encourage the transition to NatGas generation from coal. This would cut our utility emissions in half.\n\n7. Get aggressive with fracking. It's a beneficial practice, but when done in the wrong areas (PA, WV), it has real measurable damage. Focus on minimizing leakage of NatGas into the atmosphere at the wellhead.\n\n8. Continue military funding of clean energy projects.

In the process, we will end up with 12 GW-hours or more of storage. And we will spend many billions of dollars. And probably throw several billion dollars away on ideas that don't work. \n\n* Keep paying people for solar and wind; any changes in policy have to be enacted five years in advance. In the last five years installed solar's gone up by a factor of 14; another factor of 14 and it might start becoming noticeable. \n\n* Increase the funding for clean energy R&amp;D by a factor of five.

Just by having lights automatically turn off when nobody's in the room and insulating our attics, things like that.\n\n* Set up a big scientific commission to find The Next Vehicle Fuel. (I don't know what, except it's not gonna be hydrogen without four separate miracles.)  Throw a lot of money at whatever decision is made- methanol, natural gas, biodiesel, I don't care.

(See, generally, 2 U.S.C. sec. 633)  The appropriators still have access to the President's Budget proposal, which contains huge amounts of information collected from all the executive agencies and which gets submitted to Congress on the first Monday in February every year.  ([Read them here](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collectionGPO.action?collectionCode=BUDGET).)\n\nThe Congressional budget process was invented in the '70s to bring a longer term and cross-governmental perspective to the annual appropriations process.  (Also, it was a Hill power play-- other lawmakers wanted to weaken the enormous power wielded by the Appropriations Committees.)  Ideally, the President presents Congress with all the required information in his Budget request, the Budget Committees review it, hold hearings, make changes to the requests where appropriate, and write a Budget Resolution, which passes both chambers.  Thereafter, any Appropriation that isn't within the terms of the Budget Resolution can be stopped in its tracks by a simple Point of Order.  (2 U.S.C. sec. 633(f))\n\nBut there is nothing stopping Congress from passing Appropriations Bills in the event that they fail to agree on a Budget Resolution.  And it is the annual Appropriations, not the Budget, that are Constitutionally necessary in order to keep the government operating on a day-to-day basis.  (\"No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of Appropriations made by Law\" U.S. Const. Art.
