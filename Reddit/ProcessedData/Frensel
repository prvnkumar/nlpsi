It does not increase the longer you're unemployed (and in some states if you don't claim that week you don't get it period). \n\nThat might be true for regular unemployment insurance - is it true for the emergency unemployment benefits? Anyway, let's look at how \"normal\" unemployment insurance works:\n\n&gt;You must meet the State requirements for wages earned or time worked during an established period of time referred to as a \"base period\".

Cash is very, very different in that it can be spent on anything. That is a very fundamental difference.\n\nAs I said in *my reply*, it is restricted.  We're talking around each other.  In personal finance/accounting, a cash equivalent is anything that can be spent like cash (in the business world its slightly different, more focused on returns and liquidity).  That includes everything from gift cards to bank notes.  Basically, if you can use that instrument to convert directly from it to some product (without incurring debt in doing so, which makes it a credit instrument) it is a cash equivalent.  It can be unrestricted (say, AmEx gift card), temporarily restricted (you cannot use it for 30 days) or permanently restricted (you can only use it for certain items).  But they are all cash equivalents.  Its just a definition.\n\n&gt;Except that $100 is restricted. Which is a very, very important difference.\n\nIts an important *distinction* but might be no different.  If I were to give you a $100 gift card that could only be spent at Amazon.com, its functionally the same as cash, given all that Amazon sells.  The likelihood of you being able to spend it is very high.  Now, say I gave you a gift card to EroticLeftHandedDogWhistlesforRedFoxes.com, most likely you're not going to be able to spend it for something you would otherwise.  In the last case, it really is a net add to your total spending.  But with the Amazon giftcard, it might not be.  Either way, they are still cash equivalents - its just whether it meets your own purchasing habits that's at issue.

Did you lose your job (and not get fired)? Then you get a set amount per week. It does not increase the longer you're unemployed (and in some states if you don't claim that week you don't get it period). \n\nThat might be true for regular unemployment insurance - is it true for the emergency unemployment benefits? Anyway, let's look at how \"normal\" unemployment insurance works:\n\n&gt;You must meet the State requirements for wages earned or time worked during an established period of time referred to as a \"base period\". (In most States, this is usually the first four out of the last five completed calendar quarters prior to the time that your claim is filed.)\n\nThen, once your claim is filed, you don't necessarily start receiving payouts immediately. Can take up to another month, I hear three weeks is typical. So we have five month potential delay time from someone being unemployed to start receiving insurance. So there's a little wiggle room there. Let me look at a graph for unemployment spending... [Here.](http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/images/pubs-images/43xxx/43734-land-Figure2.png)\n\nSo it looks like \"regular and extended benefits\" went up as jobs were lost, and then started going down again, exactly as expected from the mechanics we have hashed out for \"standard\" unemployment insurance. \n\n&gt;You are considered potentially eligible for the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program if you have a Connecticut unemployment claim, and:\n\n&gt;You filed an unemployment claim **effective May 7, 2006, or later;**\n\n&gt;You are fully unemployed, **or partially unemployed and working part-time,** as of July 6, 2008;\n\n&gt;You have no rights to unemployment benefits from any other state, the federal government or Canada;\n\n&gt;You are legally authorized to work in the United States;\n\n&gt;You are able and available for and seeking employment.\n\nSo my quick googling of emergency unemployment insurance looks like it turns up an explanation for increased unemployment spending as jobs were not being lost, which is that those emergency benefits have different requirements.

This is a system of government with three branches and checks and balances - we need to get all of them in reasonable shape. \n\nThe real issue is taking the House back so that the Democrats can actually do their sensible center-*right* (in any same world) thing. Seriously their proposals are well to the right of Nixon's on healthcare and they are screamed at as socialists. One of our parties has clearly gone off the rails to the political deep end, and it needs to be defeated soundly so it can rethink its positions.\n\nA third party can help if it's a third party that cannibalizes the Republicans, I suppose. But it will always be a stupid idea. In a competitive system you will always effectively have two entities - the incumbents and the opposition. The more splintered factions simply won't be viable at either of these roles. You end up with something very like a two party system no matter how many parties you have, except with greater volatility and an illusion of more meaningful choice.\n\nThese two parties we have now are the result of two attempts to appeal to the preferences of the population. There are different ways to do that In viable ways, but the all have the problem that they don't provide someone with a huge array of real choices and they don't fit anyone's preferences with any sort of precision unless that someone has tailored their preferences to be the party's. \n\nYou don't fix that with arbitrary-number-of-party coalitions, because what you have already is pretty much a coalition except under one name instead of three or whatever and with less instability. You might argue that instability of that sort leads to better choices. I'll go ahead and point you to Europe in general and Israel as counter-examples. \n\nThe problem we have is not a system problem (except for the gerrymandering) it is a population problem. We have a population more politically polarized than it has been since the Civil War. In order to move forward, one side simply has to *win*. I believe it should be and will be the D's, but I fear it will take the death of a large portion of the R's constituency, and *that* will take lots of time.\n\nBut I am open to ideas about how to hasten that victory. Anything else is pretty much a waste of time at this point. Electing a good president was one that kind of had to happen when the R's didn't rule the House.

That's why there are only exists two brands of car (one model each) that one can choose from.   \n - \"You end up with something very like a two party system no matter how many parties you have\"  The multiple parties serves a greater purpose of greying up the political ideological specturm.  Right now there is no grey area.  It's black vs white, democrat vs republican, good vs evil, and that's how it's portrayed by whatever American media you're looking.  This allows coverage and elections to be party based and not issue based.  You make the spectrum grey (by allowing for more parties by changing the electoral process to something like preferential voting) and all the sudden elections start becoming more issue-based, the American people are forced to become more informed on issues, and less party loyal.   \n - This post hits the nail on the head when stating \"We have a population more politically polarized than it has been since the Civil War.\" but doesn't understand that it's the current system that not only allows this but ENCOURAGES it.  You get enough media saying your choice is black and white and an electoral process (First Past the Post) that actually mathematically trends toward a two party system and it's a perfect storm for polarization.   \n - The Tea Party should be a separate party.  The Republicans need to stop primarying them in Republican primaries if they have interest in furthering the political process.   \n - \"The problem we have is not a system problem\" it IS absolutely a system problem.  The very simple reform of instituting preferential voting in all federal elections changes the way elections are covered, the political spectrum is portrayed by the media, and ultimately how politics is viewed by those that don't know any better...yet.   \n - The simple solution for gerrymandering (because Frensel mentioned it) is Shortest-Splitline Method.  It can still be gamed, but it's a helluva lot harder than our current \"Let's draw these lines where it's most advantageous for us.\" system.   \n   \nHere's where Frensel and I agree - there will always be two dominant parties *but* only because the political middle will shift as the American public's political ideals shift.  If you think about a Gaussian function / bell curve with the area representing the total number of voters spread across a linear political spectrum (for simplicity sake), then split vertically down the center (left vs right) the two dominant parties (the two closest to the center) will always want to have as many voters as possible in their portion.  The two main parties will shift their political ideologies to encompass as many voters as possible.  This will change where centrist policies fall as the two major parties shift to match representation of the American voting public.  Our current system doesn't allow this because of the underlying two-party system (created by FPTP).  Everything is portrayed in a Dems vs Reps manner.  Issues are rarely ever broached in media that non-hyper-political Americans see, bipartisanship is demonized, stupidity by politicians and the electorate is too readily accepted.  Preferential voting instituted in all federal elections forces a more complex view into the minds of the American electorate and will fix the polarization of American politics.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1joako", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cbh708f", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1375684953", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cbgr40j", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429947776, "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is exactly the kind of response I was looking for, thank you.

It is welfare that does not incentivize lying or have the bureaucratic mess that welfare normally implies. You just give every adult citizen a \"basic income,\" howevermuch that is, and you take it back through taxes from those you judge to not need it. Now you only have one problem, which you had before anyways, and that is making sure people pay the appropriate taxes.\n\nThis allows people to be much closer to the economic ideal of them being free agents trying to maximize their utility. Because they have a safety net - a reliable, consistent safety net that does not humiliate them, waste their time, or incentivize them to lie - they are free to pursue whatever they want to pursue. The onus moves to employers to provide enough reward and good enough working conditions to get people in.\n\nBut as for what is accomplishable in the current political landscape, well, that's just about nothing.

In this case, the smaller party then is the decisive element for one side or the other to get control -- giving it, it would seem, undue influence.\n\nHowever, in countries that do have proportional representation that allows for multiple parties to spring up, there are usually multiple minority parties, decreasing the chance that any one minority party would actually have decisive power in this way.\n\nLet me give you an example. In Sweden, there are two large blocs of parties. Each is, in fact, led by a party that in the last election garned almost exactly 30% of the vote each: the Social Democrats on the left, and the Moderates on the right. There are six other parties that are over the threshold for representation (5%), who got between 5.6% and 7.3% in the last election. Five of the parties are in coalition with one or the other of the larger parties, while one is \"independent\" (although in reality being kept at arm's length because it's very controversial). \n\nThe result of a political landscape like this is not that one of the minority parties gets undue power -- if one tries to force a larger party into certain actions, they can turn towards the other parties.

Doesn't that \"diminish their voice\" as much as electoral roadblocks?\n\nEdit: read this article by Illya Somin: \"Restricting Democracy in Order to Protect Other Liberal Values\".\n\nhttp://www.volokh.com/2013/07/05/restricting-democracy-in-order-to-protect-other-liberal-values/", "edited": 1373042327, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ho6fi", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cawgxwl", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1373042138", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cawgi7j", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430574982, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; The upside to the American system is that we don't have Greece-style politics where groups like Golden Dawn (literally Nazis) have a voice in government.\n\nWhat you have to remember is that, as awful as Golden Dawn is, people are voting for them in order for them to secure that voice, and you are therefore saying that we should have an electoral system rigged towards the middle ground so that any large group of right-wing activists can't get their democratic say in government.

Then there is another, smaller party that gets 16% of the vote. In this case, the smaller party then is the decisive element for one side or the other to get control -- giving it, it would seem, undue influence.\n\nHowever, in countries that do have proportional representation that allows for multiple parties to spring up, there are usually multiple minority parties, decreasing the chance that any one minority party would actually have decisive power in this way.\n\nLet me give you an example. In Sweden, there are two large blocs of parties. Each is, in fact, led by a party that in the last election garned almost exactly 30% of the vote each: the Social Democrats on the left, and the Moderates on the right. There are six other parties that are over the threshold for representation (5%), who got between 5.6% and 7.3% in the last election. Five of the parties are in coalition with one or the other of the larger parties, while one is \"independent\" (although in reality being kept at arm's length because it's very controversial). \n\nThe result of a political landscape like this is not that one of the minority parties gets undue power -- if one tries to force a larger party into certain actions, they can turn towards the other parties.

If we had smart policy this sort of moronic situation wouldn't arise, but we don't, and it did, and I can't expect someone who is armed with a weapon to not use it when his head is being smashed into concrete by his assailant. Sure, if he didn't have a weapon it is quite unlikely that anyone would have been killed or seriously injured, but expecting someone to make that call in that sort of situation is like expecting someone not to flinch when you clap your hands in front of their face.

If he followed him and threatened him, sure. I haven't seen evidence that he did. In any case, no matter what he did what Treyvon should have done is run, not attack. He clearly physically outmatched Zimmerman, so it is very unlikely that Zimmerman forced him into an analogous position to the one he forced Zimmerman into.

Government is a monopoly on coercion, or whatever people give it power to monopolize over. You are getting a few choices from within one system. You're saying that you have freedom of choice if walmart is the only store as long as they carry different items and brands. You cannot really return the good you bought with your single vote. The market forces don't exist. Politicians aren't held liable to the things they say. How many promises has Obama made that haven't come true at all? The same goes for every president, and every politician. \n\n&gt;adverts largely work through crude associations with things that people think of as \"good\" rather than actual information.\n\nreplace the word \"adverts\" with politicians, and your statement is far more correct. Adverts and corporations USE government to get unfair advantages, the government and the politicians that YOU vote for, but cannot hold accountable. You don't stockpile votes, and you can't threaten to take your votes elsewhere anytime soon.

The government provides far more crucial services? Only because they have a monopoly over the services they provide - by force I might add. The post office is only a crucial service of government because the government makes it illegal for anyone else to carry first class mail. UPS, FedEx, DHL all get packages places faster, and with a guarantee as opposed to government subsidized mail. Most importantly, because those private services aren't monopolized like first class mail, they are held accountable for their actions. As far as people voting on their \"genuine\" beleifs - I'll say this. I trust a corporation or business who is subject to real market forces more than I will trust a politician who doesn't have to keep any of his word, by law. Politicians do not have to do what they say. Almost all politicians are business men, that can easily been seen in the jobs they have held before going into politics, and it can be seen by how many senators and congressmen become lobbyists.

What I said was correct, and you didn't offer a refutation for it, or really any of what I said. Standard oil can have a monopoly and offer different grades of lead gasoline. Mcdonalds can have a monopoly and still offer more than hamburgers. Options within a a single system still makes that system a monopoly - since you didn't say otherwise I'll suppose you realize my Walmart comparison is correct. Illusion of choice isn't choice. On top of that, just around 20% of people voted this election. Considering everyone, and to be devils advocate I'll say 85%, of people have a free vote in their pocket, that is a lot of people who chose not to spend their vote on our monopolistic system. There is very little demand in terms of votes.\n\n&gt;You could indeed make the case that there aren't enough options - but the same criticism can be laid at the foot of any market.\n\nYeah, of any single market - not the market in general. The market consists of what people want in combination with what they demand, and something exists if the dollars are real, and are offered in either direction. \n\n&gt;You are getting a few choices from within one system.\n&gt;&gt;...Yup. That's the deal.\n\nYeah... that's the deal - and why it is a monopolistic system. I think YOU are the one who doesn't understand what a monopoly is... There are three different sorts of monopoly: natural monopoly, artificial monopoly, and state monopoly. Only the first\nis of any importance in a laissez-faire, or market society. \n\nA natural monopoly exists when the optimum size for a firm in some area of production is so large that there is room for only one such firm on the market. A smaller competitor is less efficient than the monopoly firm and hence unable to compete with it. Except where the market is very small (a small town grocery store, for example), this is a rather\nuncommon situation.\n\nIn the United States in this century the predominant form of monopoly has not been natural monopoly, artificial monopoly, or direct state monopoly, but state monopoly in private hands. Private firms, unable to establish monopolies or cartels because they had no way of keeping out competitors, turned to the government. This is the origin of the regulation of transportation\u2014the Interstate Commerce Commission as well as the Civil Aeronautics Board. A similar process is responsible for occupational licensing, which gives monopoly power to many craft unions, among them the most powerful and probably the most pernicious craft union of all, the American Medical Association.\n\n\n&gt;Politicians aren't held liable to the things they say.\n&gt;&gt;Sure they are, just not in the way you want them to be.\n\nI'm starting to see a blind state adherence in your replies... You're happy with the system we have set up of accountability? That's pathetic if you are. Politicians should be held up to the same level of accountability as businesses. We pay taxes, go to war, and live by the rules and laws they make and pass. You're showing coardice if you're just going to say it is perfectly dandy because they know what's best. If you truly wan't politicians to have the best job security because they are the ones that potentially secure your job, you're not thinking through the logic backwards and forwards. \n\n\n&gt;Nope. Though being a near-monopoly is part of the crucial service, for things like law enforcement, military, and court. I wouldn't want to live in a place where the government does not have a near-monopoly on those things, and neither would you - though in your ignorance you might think you would.\n\nIgnorant? No need for name calling here. You're the one who isn't understanding my point of view. I absolutely would want to live somewhere where everything has to live up to a market standard. Congress has a 9% approval rating, and everyone there has a cushy job, with lots of connections and the best healthcare. Do you know what happens to a business with a 9% approval rating? I think you do. You're wrapped up in statist logic. If the government is proven terrible at producing cars and food and technology for society, why would you think they are competent to produce laws, rules and regulations, things which are no easier to create, for that society? You probably think something along the lines of \"pshh - private prisions etc...\" and again - think about the actual free market logic behind the situation. Would you, or anyone else pay to keep someone in prison for marijuana possession, especially when it costs thousands of dollars a year, a day in some cases? I am far from ignorant. I used to believe in socialism - protectionism in economics. I have just come to be a voluntarist, or an anarcho-capitalist. I have likely thought through this type of idea more than you have. Just because you automatically think the profit motive leads one direction, that gives you zero justification to call me ignorant. \n\n&gt;replace the word \"adverts\" with politicians, and your statement is far more correct.\n&gt;&gt;It's correct for both, you can't possibly make a legitimate argument otherwise.\n\nYeah - note my use of the phrase \"would be more correct\". You cut that off though.. The whole point of this is to show you why it is ridiculous for you to think that when people label themselves as \"government\" that their advertising means or ends are any different then when they are labeled \"businessmen\". You have yet to make any case, because there is no case to be made. You're asserting that when men label themselves in a certain manner, they become just. In that case, we should make everything owned by government - then advertising will all be noble, huh?\n\n&gt;The post office\n&gt;&gt;Is an example of a rather superfluous government service. Trying to use that one example as proof that the entire government is like that is, well, absurd.\n\nI didn't assert in any way, shape, or form that it was the sole example. You're trying to box me into a position so you can call me \"absurd\", when you're the one essentially saying \"when a product or service is marketed by men calling themselves a government, the demand is real. When businesses or men do the same, the demand is false\". Look at social security - people would surely take responsibility for their savings if they weren't FORCED to pay social security - never mind that it will be insolvent. \n\n&gt;No, business isn't bad. I just reject the notion that the demand created by business advertising is more \"real\" or \"better\" than the demand created by government activities.\n\nThe demand made by business isn't \"more real\". You're letting labels and minutia about semantics cloud your thinking. An advertisement is an advertisement. Your assertion is plain silly.

Government is a monopoly on coercion, or whatever people give it power to monopolize over. You are getting a few choices from within one system. You're saying that you have freedom of choice if walmart is the only store as long as they carry different items and brands. You cannot really return the good you bought with your single vote. The market forces don't exist. Politicians aren't held liable to the things they say. How many promises has Obama made that haven't come true at all? The same goes for every president, and every politician. \n\n&gt;adverts largely work through crude associations with things that people think of as \"good\" rather than actual information.\n\nreplace the word \"adverts\" with politicians, and your statement is far more correct. Adverts and corporations USE government to get unfair advantages, the government and the politicians that YOU vote for, but cannot hold accountable. You don't stockpile votes, and you can't threaten to take your votes elsewhere anytime soon.

The government provides far more crucial services? Only because they have a monopoly over the services they provide - by force I might add. The post office is only a crucial service of government because the government makes it illegal for anyone else to carry first class mail. UPS, FedEx, DHL all get packages places faster, and with a guarantee as opposed to government subsidized mail. Most importantly, because those private services aren't monopolized like first class mail, they are held accountable for their actions. As far as people voting on their \"genuine\" beleifs - I'll say this. I trust a corporation or business who is subject to real market forces more than I will trust a politician who doesn't have to keep any of his word, by law. Politicians do not have to do what they say. Almost all politicians are business men, that can easily been seen in the jobs they have held before going into politics, and it can be seen by how many senators and congressmen become lobbyists.

Current owners used their equity like an ATM; boats, big screens, kitchen remodels, etc. and they rolled everything back in to their mortgage. Hiring was going gangbusters b/c three were so many banking/ mortgage related jobs (I worked in staffing during those years). They were all relatively low skill jobs that might normally pay ~$10/hr but it was getting hard to find good people so overtime became the norm (20hrs wasn't uncommon) and hen we needed to pay people even more to compete with other companies or retain our people. The obvious problem was \"how can these people afford to buy these houses and cars &amp; when will it stop?\" I agree it was the borrowers that were stupid and greedy &amp; there were very few \"unknowing\" participants. But when Lehman tanked &amp; all the dirty laundry spilled, instead of the banks getting hammered for their calculated and risky loans, they got bailout money and they persecuted home buyers. They had zero incentive to adjust their ARM loan rates. If you couldn't pay you were out; but it's not always easy to go through foreclosure unless you're close to bankruptcy.       \nAlso, printing money devalues the current supply.

They do not submit the firearms that came from their own government, were traced to Mexican citizens, or that could not have come from the US.\n\nShe then goes on to quote other Democratic politicans, and advocate her own AWB and Project Gunrunner (which was a miserable failure because of the gross incompetence and negligence of federal officials). \n\n&gt;Yes.

One the other hand democracy was traditionally viewed as a negative form of goverment, an idea argued by classic political theorists like Pluto and the Athority himself, Aristotle.

That's why the \"well people will just use bombs\" argument doesn't get much attention. The thing is, if you make guns that hard to get, people who want to kill will just find a substitute weapon. It's that simple. It may not be a home made bomb, but people will get creative, especially when they plan on killing themselves anyways.

You act as if the possibility of a tyrannical goverment is unheard of. \nAlso, although you say you \"believe in democracy\" I feal that this argument is naive. The idea of democracy as being a positive form of goverment is actually a relatively new one. One the other hand democracy was traditionally viewed as a negative form of goverment, an idea argued by classic political theorists like Pluto and the Athority himself, Aristotle. Also our goverment wasnt even founded apon the idea of democracy, the founding fathers desinged our goverment to be a Constitutional Republic. The difference between the two lies in the fact that in a Constitutional Republic there are a set of rules that the goverment must obey, aka a constitution. \nAt the close of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, when asked \"what have you given us?' Ben franklin responded \"a republic, if you can keep it.\" This is a telling quote when concerning the current gun control debate. The whole idea of a constitutional republic is based apon the idea that the constitution must be followed for it to work. The reason the Ben Franklin quote is important is because it reflects the need to perserve the constitution. And the right of the people to bear arms is in the constitution for a reason. That is why i feel that the constitutional argument is the most legitamite of all the arguments. \n\"Necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom. It is the argument of tyrants; it is the creed of slaves.\"\n- William Pitt", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93vn2m", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364448975", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Frensel", "id": "t1_c93h0uw", "parent_id": "t1_c93diiz", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431721344, "controversiality": 1, "edited": 1364407112, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1b315z", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93h0uw", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364406891", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "breauxstradamus", "id": "t1_c93diiz", "parent_id": "t1_c93577s", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431719603, "controversiality": 0, "body": "We're acting as if school shootings are being committed like drug abuse.

The bulk-to-profit ratio is way higher. The risk-to-profit ratio is way higher. That means that there will be much less smuggling of this particular commodity. Sure, there will be *some* - but there will be much less.

And making it harder for non-law abiding citizens to get them at the same time. That's undoubtedly a good tradeoff. Look at the gun death rate decline in other places that have implemented gun control. \n\nThe thing is, it is more or less impossible to tell whether a given person with a gun will be law-abiding or non-abiding until either the first time they fire their gun carelessly or in anger, or until they die without having done so. So it is a very good idea to make guns more difficult to acquire, and discourage their acquisition. \n", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Frensel", "id": "t1_c93o8tr", "parent_id": "t1_c93nc7g", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431724991, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1b315z", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93o8tr", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364426126", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c93nc7g", "parent_id": "t1_c93577s", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431724569, "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1b315z", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93nc7g", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364423515", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Frensel", "id": "t1_c93577s", "parent_id": "t1_c934f1p", "score": 46, "retrieved_on": 1431715624, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1364354124, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1b315z", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93577s", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364353801", "distinguished": null, "ups": 46}
