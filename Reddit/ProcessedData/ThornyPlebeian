[Pakistan](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/03/AR2008110302638.html) has a deal with the United States to operate drones in its territory, however they regularly protest them in order to save face with their people. Basically, they want all the benefit of American power but none of the immediate political consequences.\n\nIt's the same idea in [Yemen](http://yemenpost.net/Detail123456789.aspx?ID=3&amp;SubID=5296) where the President and the Army Chief of Staff have authorized American drone strikes. Basically, remember that the Pakistani and Yemeni elements of Al-Quaeda are a problem for their governments too. It's worth authorizing American drones if it means that their governments are safer.\n\nSomalia is a little different, I can't find any news sources to back up official, or unofficial government sanction. But this can be explained by the fact that Somalia doesn't really have an authoritative government. \n\nIn the end though, the Americans have the unofficial support of local governments to do this, they just protest to save political face.

And becoming a 'high up' politician is one hell of a long game plan. Believe me, it takes years of work to get elected to anything, much less scramble to the top of the pack of elected officials.\n\nSo I've studied political science for a long time, and more recently I've become involved in party politics in Canada to the point where I'm now a party boss in my 'district.'

Politicians have degrees (if they have one) in a whole variety of things, and their staffers by and large in my experience have some combination of political science/history/comms/econ degrees. But, what matters the most is networking. Political parties are notoriously nepotistic, meaning that you need to get involved at the low levels and do good work while meeting people before anyone trusts you enough to move you up.\n\nParty politics is about trust, networks, and making the right friends. You need to get in and prove your worth unless you're well connected from the start. It sort of sucks at the start (especially if you hate cold calling and door knocking) - but eventually you'll meet someone who can offer you something better and so on.\n\nBut I'm Canadian, maybe American parties are different?

The sole authority in international judicial matters rests with the International Court of Justice.\n\nBasically Milosevic (and Koehler) argue that since UNSC and not the General Assembly struck the tribunal, it was legally invalid.

Realism isn't some monolithic beast that only cares for material power (even if people like Waltz, Mearsheimer, Rose would have it that way). This comes down to the non-material forms of power that the United States draws from to supplement material powers (the nukes, the carriers etc).

Except I consider non-material factors, not just material ones. \n\n&gt;For example, you could argue that the US/German relationship has been \"damaged\" by the outrage of them spying on Merkel, but according to realist theory the fact they are spying on you is irrelevant, if being a close ally of the US gives you the best possible outcome for your national interest, you're never going to switch to being China's ally no matter how angry you are. \n\nAgain, you're right in the context of game theory.

That's rather extreme and my argument was a little more subtle.\n\nSo you're not wrong, but my argument was a little more subtle than maybe game theory is equipped to handle.

You mentioned the UK, but France has virtually the same military capabilities.

Which of these countries eventually emerge as counters to the U.S., and in what form (U.K. or EU?), I do not know.\n\nMy real issue with your comment is your definition though.  You seem to be taking an extremely \"naval-centric\" view of power.  Just an example of why I disagree wholeheartedly with that view:  if Soviet power had ever extended from the western shores of France to the Korean Peninsula, and from Siberia to the Mediterranean and Southeast Asia, then the country could have been economically and militarily dominant.  Even if they would have been unable to fight in another hemisphere or across an ocean.\n\nThe problem with your definition of unipolarity is that it implies that only great powers like the current U.S. or the former British Empire were \"real\" great powers, and that there is somehow less value in being able to project a million troops a thousand kilometers from your border than there is in being able to send a few hundred thousand troops several thousand kilometers away.  It really depends on the country in question and the geopolitical situation, regardless of how impressive logistically one feat is over another.\n\nThe U.S. is in a unique position since it has no real regional competitors and is isolated from much of the world, so it relies on power projection, but other possible poles of a multipolar system have little to no concern with projecting power in another hemisphere, because most, if not all, of their national interests occur within their own hemisphere, if not their own continent.  The Eurasian landmass is where these countries will be most interested, as well as Africa which is very close by.\n\nAnd honestly, 10 000 troops is not very much, assuming that by \"equipment\" you mean just the troops' equipment, and not tanks or APVs, and you're talking about doing this in just one trip, then I know the PLAN is more or less capable of doing so already.  If we talk about Australia or somewhere else in Oceania, for example, as being that other hemisphere then we can see that, even excluding the PLAN's new aircraft carrier and any future aircraft carriers or amphibious ships, the PLAN's current complement of 3 Type 071 transport docks along with dozens of landing ships (mostly medium or tank and generally capable of carrying 250 fully equipped troops or more depending on variant) could easily ferry 10 000 fully equipped troops in a single trip, and if every amphibious ship was used to its full capacity then they could likely more or less double the 10 000 troop requirement.\n\nI don't know much about other countries' navies, but I doubt that any besides the U.S. and PRC could accomplish this in a single trip as things tand right now, but perhaps the U.K. and France could.  If you're willing to look at more unconventional uses of traditional military hardware (using non-amphibious attack ships for amphibious landings or simple transportation), and allow for multiple trips, then I am confident that we could add some other countries into the mix, probably starting with India or Japan, and maybe including Italy or Spain.  Also, Russia's landing craft and aircraft carrier combined could probably come pretty close to bringing 10 000 troops into southern or central Africa, but they might fall short a couple thousand, I don't really know to be honest.\n\nI really don't think that this is a good gauge of relative material power capabilities, though.

As long as they have a virtually untouchable sphere of influence, they would probably classify as a pole in a multipolar world.\n\nThe U.S. does not own capitalism, so other countries might be very happy to continue engaging in trading, taking part in world institutions, and expanding their levels of globalization even if the U.S. ability to project power has been reduced or their leadership is in some other way challenged or weakened.

So when I put my realist cap on to perform foreign policy analyses, power becomes my focus and I essentially shun questions of ethics/morals. Now, I don't view it as immoral, so much as amoral and we'll have to agree to disagree on it since I'm guessing it largely comes down to philosophical differences. My education was hugely impacted by writers like Hobbes and Machiavelli, and my research has largely focused on some pretty awful things (in moral terms). So it shouldn't be an awful surprise that I can 'switch off' concerns of morality for the purpose of doing this sort of thing.\n\nI guess my personal approach is that if someone wants to make ethics and morals the focus of their research, they are free to worry about those things. Morals and ethics are rarely a concern to my work.\n\n&gt;might makes right\" this seems to be incomparable with any sort of human rights advocacy.\n\nSort of. A lot of realists find ways to justify interventions to prevent human rights atrocities like genocide through other means. For instance, instead of arguing for intervention based on human rights violations, a realist (of most variations) might argue intervention is required to maintain regional stability and local balances of power. The human rights concerns just happen to end up as a happy by-product of maintaining the balance of power/regional stability. Also, the intervening states need some sort of interest in doing so. So if regional stability is in the interest of say, France, the French will intervene (like Mali), if it's not - they won't (like Rwanda). The protection of human rights is incidental to the larger picture.\n\nNow, this doesn't always happen. Rwanda, Darfur and a few other human rights abuses have gone unattended. This only reinforces the idea if no state finds it in their interests to stop genocide, they simply won't. It's terrible, but it sort of goes towards proving that the international system doesn't give two shakes about what is 'right', they care about what's in it for them.\n\nYou might also find it interesting that I'm a gay, Canadian that subscribes to realpolitik in international affairs...

Now, I don't view it as immoral, so much as amoral and we'll have to agree to disagree on it since I'm guessing it largely comes down to philosophical differences. My education was hugely impacted by writers like Hobbes and Machiavelli, and my research has largely focused on some pretty awful things (in moral terms). So it shouldn't be an awful surprise that I can 'switch off' concerns of morality for the purpose of doing this sort of thing.\n\nI guess my personal approach is that if someone wants to make ethics and morals the focus of their research, they are free to worry about those things.

A lot of realists find ways to justify interventions to prevent human rights atrocities like genocide through other means. For instance, instead of arguing for intervention based on human rights violations, a realist (of most variations) might argue intervention is required to maintain regional stability and local balances of power. The human rights concerns just happen to end up as a happy by-product of maintaining the balance of power/regional stability. Also, the intervening states need some sort of interest in doing so. So if regional stability is in the interest of say, France, the French will intervene (like Mali), if it's not - they won't (like Rwanda). The protection of human rights is incidental to the larger picture.\n\nNow, this doesn't always happen. Rwanda, Darfur and a few other human rights abuses have gone unattended. This only reinforces the idea if no state finds it in their interests to stop genocide, they simply won't. It's terrible, but it sort of goes towards proving that the international system doesn't give two shakes about what is 'right', they care about what's in it for them.\n\nYou might also find it interesting that I'm a gay, Canadian that subscribes to realpolitik in international affairs...

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1pwk5w", "selftext": "Alright, I'll risk the potential for acrimony and endless inbox messages telling me why I'm wrong. To put this in context, I completed my graduate education in International Relations with a specific focus on American-Canadian security issues.\n\nSnowden's leaks run the risk of weakening American power on the international scene if we accept that power is inclusive of material (guns, warships, tanks etc) and non-material factors (influence, authority etc). The leaks pose a problem because they serve to embarrass the United States in the face of its allies and demonstrate weakness in its internal security processes in what should be some of the most secure institutions of the state. \n\nSo Snowden managed to dent American influence among its allies (even if everyone does spy on one another, it still doesn't look good) and now states that are genuinely interested in weakening American power have cause to believe that they might be able to successfully challenge it in ways not previously possible. Essentially, it's a problem that emboldens potential enemies and makes allies less keen to back American interests.\n\nSo why is a weakened America a problem? The United States has actually successfully maintained international peace through its existence as a world hegemon (especially if you suscribe to [Hegemonic Stability Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemonic_stability_theory)] and a strong America lends economic stability because of its immense consumer base and the fact that the USD is still the reserve currency of the world. So remember, peace through power, stability though power. These are fairly core principles of [realism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_%28international_relations%29). So with the United States' non-material power weakened, it's not able to project itself as effectively as it was once able to do.\n\nNow, let me caveat a bunch of stuff I've just said. The damage is **proportional** - so I'm not saying 'Snowden will cause international chaos'. What I'm suggesting is that his leaks, in the greater scheme of international relations has the *potential* to make life difficult for the United States and its allies. The United States has *a lot* of power to go around, so no one can say what the immediate impact will be. My argument is simply that there is the *potential* for a decrease in non-material power - which negatively impacts the United States and its allies.\n\nAlso, my arguments don't care about internal American politics or law. I don't care if what he did was illegal, or legal, those are inconsequential to my argument. He might be legally justified, he might be ethically/morally justified, and that's fine. But in this analysis, ethics, morals and law mean precisely bunk. Power (in this analysis) is essentially all that matters. What I personally think about the morals/ethics/law of all this is completely separate (but it may or may not be similar) to my analysis of the international implications of his actions.\n\ntl;dr - The leaks hurt American non-material power. No one can quantify how much, or predict the exact impact, but the best argument against his leaks is that the United States plays an integral role in maintaining international peace, and the leaks have the small potential for hurting that peace.\n\nEdit - No acrimony, only intelligent and pleasant conversation.

Realism isn't some monolithic beast that only cares for material power (even if people like Waltz, Mearsheimer, Rose would have it that way).

At it's heart realism is defined by a few core assumptions, one of which is the importance of national interest. But, national interests are defined by power. If we want to go back to the holy bible of realism, that particular line is present in Hans Morgenthau's *Politics Among Nations* where he says\n\n&gt;The main signpost of political realism is the concept of interest defined in terms of power [Morgenthau, 1948]\n\nWhat I'm getting at here is that you can't separate national interest from power, even non-material power. So American material or non-material power is very relevant when discussing national interests of allies and enemies alike. So if American power (non-material in this case) is dented (even a little) the 'calculations' that go into determining the national interests of its allies (such as Germany) change - even if it's a slight change. So it doesn't imply that there is more at play than national interest, what I'm suggesting is that the interplay between national interest and power is dynamic - which is consistent to realism. \n\nSo when I say that, hypothetically Germany, is less likely to cooperate as keenly with the United States what I'm saying is that Germany's national interests have shifted slightly in response to America's relative power change (even if it's slight).\n\nI hope I'm making sense.", "id": "t1_cd6wcfx", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "ThornyPlebeian", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Can I just say how amazed I am at you two disagreeing with each other and neither of you has a single downvote?

Furthermore, the gaps between the U.S. and other countries in both quantity and quality of military forces have also been shrinking.\n\nAt the same time, a reduction in American political will for overseas operations, reduced spending (both military and non-military), and lowered international opinion of the U.S. (since the start of the Iraq War) have all reduced American capacity to influence the policies of other countries, and reduced their relative power in the international system.

You mentioned the UK, but France has virtually the same military capabilities.  There's also the material power of Germany and Japan, vast potential power from India and Brazil, and an enormous amount of existing power from the PRC and the Russian Federation.  Which of these countries eventually emerge as counters to the U.S., and in what form (U.K. or EU?), I do not know.\n\nMy real issue with your comment is your definition though.  You seem to be taking an extremely \"naval-centric\" view of power.  Just an example of why I disagree wholeheartedly with that view:  if Soviet power had ever extended from the western shores of France to the Korean Peninsula, and from Siberia to the Mediterranean and Southeast Asia, then the country could have been economically and militarily dominant.  Even if they would have been unable to fight in another hemisphere or across an ocean.\n\nThe problem with your definition of unipolarity is that it implies that only great powers like the current U.S. or the former British Empire were \"real\" great powers, and that there is somehow less value in being able to project a million troops a thousand kilometers from your border than there is in being able to send a few hundred thousand troops several thousand kilometers away.  It really depends on the country in question and the geopolitical situation, regardless of how impressive logistically one feat is over another.\n\nThe U.S. is in a unique position since it has no real regional competitors and is isolated from much of the world, so it relies on power projection, but other possible poles of a multipolar system have little to no concern with projecting power in another hemisphere, because most, if not all, of their national interests occur within their own hemisphere, if not their own continent.  The Eurasian landmass is where these countries will be most interested, as well as Africa which is very close by.\n\nAnd honestly, 10 000 troops is not very much, assuming that by \"equipment\" you mean just the troops' equipment, and not tanks or APVs, and you're talking about doing this in just one trip, then I know the PLAN is more or less capable of doing so already.  If we talk about Australia or somewhere else in Oceania, for example, as being that other hemisphere then we can see that, even excluding the PLAN's new aircraft carrier and any future aircraft carriers or amphibious ships, the PLAN's current complement of 3 Type 071 transport docks along with dozens of landing ships (mostly medium or tank and generally capable of carrying 250 fully equipped troops or more depending on variant) could easily ferry 10 000 fully equipped troops in a single trip, and if every amphibious ship was used to its full capacity then they could likely more or less double the 10 000 troop requirement.\n\nI don't know much about other countries' navies, but I doubt that any besides the U.S. and PRC could accomplish this in a single trip as things tand right now, but perhaps the U.K. and France could.  If you're willing to look at more unconventional uses of traditional military hardware (using non-amphibious attack ships for amphibious landings or simple transportation), and allow for multiple trips, then I am confident that we could add some other countries into the mix, probably starting with India or Japan, and maybe including Italy or Spain.  Also, Russia's landing craft and aircraft carrier combined could probably come pretty close to bringing 10 000 troops into southern or central Africa, but they might fall short a couple thousand, I don't really know to be honest.\n\nI really don't think that this is a good gauge of relative material power capabilities, though.

I think that they would lose far too many of their planes and pilots to both dogfighting and air defense systems before they could bring down even a sizable amount of another great power's land forces.\n\nThe fact that we're having the conversation is itself a testament to the large gap in military capabilities, but even American power projection has limits.  I doubt the American capacity to fight a major land war against another great power on the Eurasian landmass because it would present far greater logistical problems than Iraq and Afghanistan combined, and they would have to deal with far higher levels of attrition.\n\nMost importantly, I think that your assessment of \"the next few decades\" is an extremely overoptimistic assessment of American capabilities.

As far as I'm concerned morals don't really matter, power matters. It happens that the United States happens to share Canadian interests and those of our allies, therefore I guess if you wanted to peg my own bias the United States being the global hegemon works wonderfully for Canada and most of the Western World.\n\nNo one else has that sort of ability to project power, may as well be a state that shares similar national interests than one that does not.

Would I be correct in assuming you reject any morality-related concepts like human rights or war crimes?  If you accept that international politics are \"might makes right\" this seems to be incomparable with any sort of human rights advocacy.\n\nBasically the idea that morality ought to be ignored in foreign policy strikes me as deeply immoral, not simply amoral.

Now, I don't view it as immoral, so much as amoral and we'll have to agree to disagree on it since I'm guessing it largely comes down to philosophical differences. My education was hugely impacted by writers like Hobbes and Machiavelli, and my research has largely focused on some pretty awful things (in moral terms). So it shouldn't be an awful surprise that I can 'switch off' concerns of morality for the purpose of doing this sort of thing.\n\nI guess my personal approach is that if someone wants to make ethics and morals the focus of their research, they are free to worry about those things. Morals and ethics are rarely a concern to my work.\n\n&gt;might makes right\" this seems to be incomparable with any sort of human rights advocacy.\n\nSort of. A lot of realists find ways to justify interventions to prevent human rights atrocities like genocide through other means. For instance, instead of arguing for intervention based on human rights violations, a realist (of most variations) might argue intervention is required to maintain regional stability and local balances of power. The human rights concerns just happen to end up as a happy by-product of maintaining the balance of power/regional stability. Also, the intervening states need some sort of interest in doing so. So if regional stability is in the interest of say, France, the French will intervene (like Mali), if it's not - they won't (like Rwanda). The protection of human rights is incidental to the larger picture.\n\nNow, this doesn't always happen. Rwanda, Darfur and a few other human rights abuses have gone unattended. This only reinforces the idea if no state finds it in their interests to stop genocide, they simply won't. It's terrible, but it sort of goes towards proving that the international system doesn't give two shakes about what is 'right', they care about what's in it for them.\n\nYou might also find it interesting that I'm a gay, Canadian that subscribes to realpolitik in international affairs...

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1olo8c", "selftext": "Yep! But I can only speak for Alexander Wendt's theory, I'm not as familiar with John Ruggie or some of the other big names.\n\nSo Wendt starts off where Ken Waltz left off, with the idea of the international system and anarchy. Structural realists insist that actors (i.e. states) are naturally self-regarding (selfish) in their pursuit of survival. Structural restraints influence the ways in which states act (in their pursuit of survival), restraints include (but are not limited to) material power which limit the actions of their competitors. Inevitably, this leads to balancing (as in the balance of power) and leads to a bunch of fun stuff like the security dilemma.\n\nAlex Wendt comes in and accepts the principle that the international system is indeed anarchic. **However**, unlike Waltz and structural realism, actors within the international system are not necessarily self-regarding. Wendt argues that there is the opportunity for groups within the international system to behave in an other-regarding (altruistic) way. Though they are not required by any means to be other-regarding, the possibility of such behaviour remains open.\n\nWendt and his colleagues introduce the idea of 'in-groups' and 'out-groups' as a way of dividing the international system. Groups are just actors that share similar identities or identify with one another. 'Out-groups' are simply groups that share different identities. For constructivists, the international system is defined by the groups that occupy it, be they states, nations, religions or any other sort of identity based group.\n\nSo where Waltz sees a system based on power and selfishness, Wendt argues that the system is defined by identity and how that shapes our interactions with other 'out-groups.' \n\nSo where structural realists see states, power and competition, constructivists see identity-groups, and the possibility of altruism within the international system. It's all about social and historical construction, rather than material power essentially.\n\nGive me a few minutes to add some suggested reading for you.\n\n**Edit**\n\n Alexander Wendt, \"Anarchy is What States Make of It: the Social Construction of Power Politics\" in International Organization 46:2, 1992\n\nAlexander Wendt. \"Social Theory of International Politics,\" 1999.\n\nAlexander Wendt. \"Constructing international politics\" in International Security, vol. 20, no. 1, 1995.\"\n", "id": "t1_cct6jjm", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "ThornyPlebeian", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1olo8c", "selftext": "This is a great answer.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1nzztb", "selftext": "It really depends on what element of the international system you're interested in. Realism does a superb job of being able to conceptualize state-oriented actions, power relations and conflict. For example, my MA thesis was on ballistic missile defence and Canadian foreign policy - using a modified realist framework made sense given the topic and content.\n\nLiberalism is well equipped to explain (and prescribe) the conditions for peace and the rise of international institutions. Realism isn't well equipped at all to explain these phenomenon (at least the more traditional sorts).\n\nConstructivism sort of dips into both, but falls short in some ways. The major schools of constructivist thought borrow realist ideas of anarchy in the international system but replace the frigid, selfish nature of humanity with the more optimistic other-help (altruistic) liberal perspective. In my viewpoint, constructivism really suffers from a lack of ontological consistency. It's almost like Alex Wendt wanted his cake and ate it too, all while watering down the theoretical consistency present in realism and liberalism.\n\nDon't forget the critical schools. Some American scholars lump them in with the constructivist school, but in Canada most academics in the field regard them as entirely different creations. Marxists, Neo-Gramscians, Post-Structuralists, Feminists and Queer Theorists all have a niche role to play in explaining the international system and interrogating the more dominant frameworks.\n\nPersonally, my research has always trended towards realism, if only because the content of my work tends to revolve around defence, security and conflict.\n\nIt's also important to note that the best theory might also depend on your geographic location. Realism tends to play really well with Americans because it's easy to talk about power when your state *is* the present power hegemon. This is why it's easier to apply frameworks to American analysis, whereas it needs modification for states that aren't particularly powerful.\n\nFor example, instead of arguing that Canada isn't interested in joining BMD because it wouldn't gain any significant international power, it was easier to argue that Canada was more interested in security. Joining BMD shields made no sense because Canadian security is already assured, making the policy politically unnecessary.\n\nAnyway, I could go on forever about IR theory so I'll stop. \n\nEdit - I also want to plug /r/ask_political_science - this is the sort of question I'd love to see over there!", "id": "t1_ccnssno", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "ThornyPlebeian", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1nzztb", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1429198130, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ccnssno", "author_flair_text": "MA | International Relations", "created_utc": "1381274132", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;I'm talking no more military interventions in terms of human rights violations that has not much to do with the US itself.\n\nThat's a really narrow definition of America's national interests though. I'm not going to make the claim that every human rights violation poses a challenge to American national interests, but the violation of international norms on the use of non-conventional weapons certainly counts. \n\nIf a state is allowed to use the weapons without effective retaliation it sends two signals. First, it speaks to the weakness of the international community (America included) and secondly it demonstrates that there might not be universal moral revulsion to the use of non-conventional weapons.\n\nThe first point about weakness is obvious. It's in America's national interests to appear strong - which means that if America talks the talk, it must walk the walk. By that I mean if America insists on condemning chemical weapons and WMD, and if it insists on remaining party to the Convention on the use of Chemical Weapons, it must enforce its beliefs.\n\nThe second point relates a little more indirectly to America's national interests. By this I mean, if those who control chemical weapons stockpiles question the seriousness by which America and the international community take their use, it is entirely possible that they will be used again. It reminds me of story I read as a kid - If you give a mouse a cookie, he'll want some milk. The next time chemical weapons are used, American foreign assets or allies could be the target. Coupled with the perception of weakness from the first problem this poses a tremendous problem for America's national interests.\n\nYou see, it all comes down to the essence of realpolitik - survival. If America wants to continue to survive the international system it *must* continue to assert its power in defense of its broad national interests. Otherwise it will lose power and risk survival. \n\nThis is all very basic international relations theory. I really recommend that people read at least excerpts from Hans Morgenthau's *Politics Among Nations* or even something a touch more modern such as Shiping Tang's *A Theory of Security for Our Time: Defensive Realism*. \n\nEither work, or the breadth of IR theory will demonstrate why America's national interests extend beyond its borders, which is why completely removing itself from humanitarian interventions, or interventions as a whole is just a terrible idea.\n\nAbout the rest of your question though, what would happen? \ninternational laws and norms wouldn't be as effectively enforced as they are right now. Which means that even though they're enforced sporadically and inconsistently today, it would be worse in a world without American military assets to rely on.\n\nBritain and France have a long and successful history of helping the cause, but neither state, or other NATO allies have the power to go it alone (or even together) without America in an armed conflict without seriously jeopardizing their own national interests. See, France and Britain don't just homeport their navies and armed forces waiting for the United States to say \"Let's go get'em boys\" - they're actively enforcing their own national interests elsewhere all the time. Meaning that any emergency intervention would either go unanswered or would require other states to make sacrifices that they might not be willing to make.\n\nThis is where America's assets come in handy. American military power is so damned strong that it can usually safeguard national interests *and* participate in emergency situations. Other states cannot do the same.\n\n**tl;dr** - Policing the world happens to coincide with America's broad national interests for very good reasons. Withdrawing from it would be costly over time. Other states cannot pick up the slack as effectively, meaning that international norms and laws would be paper tigers not taken very seriously.\n\n\n\nSome basic IR theory that everyone should read:\n\nHans Morgenthau, *Politics Among Nations*, 1948.\n\nHedley Bull, *The Anarchical Society*, 1977.\n\nKenneth Waltz, *Man, the State and War,* 1959.\n\nKenneth Waltz, *Theory of International Politics,* 1979.\n\nAnd specifically some stuff on humanitarian interventions (though he and I ideologically disagree) anything by Fernando Teson will do.", "id": "t1_cbzvuym", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "ThornyPlebeian", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ljdbk", "id": "t1_cc01i6p", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Jimmyfinder", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ljdbk", "id": "t1_cc02cit", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cc01i6p", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429619050, "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cc02cit", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1378100784", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cc02rq3", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Borborygmous", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ljdbk", "selftext": "Of course it brings stability and instability at the same time - no method of global intervention will be completely effective or embraced.

We were the primary founders of it, along with it's progenitor, the League of Nations, and we have always acted as we saw fit, whether the UN agreed or disagreed. To boot, it's headquarters are in *New York City*, on American land. Plus, it's other 'arms', like the World Bank, and the IMF, are both headquartered in the US, and heavily influenced by American politics and the like. \n\n&gt;Second, increases in wealth and interdepence make sure we rely on trading and cooperation in stead of conquering each other. \n\nGenerally, this would be attributed to American naval dominance, allowing for the free-est trade, especially on the seas, since the age of British naval dominance. Other American 'policing' efforts are similarly responsible. \n\n&gt;Also important is a change in norms and practices which ensure we don't beat eachothers heads in when we have an argument (and yet the USA ranks among the highest in civilian interpersonal violence- despite being a 'hegemony' internationally). \n\nInternal affairs of a nation, and how it's power and actions figure into the global community don't overlap 100%. For one, much of America's social issues and violence stems from the still-present specter of slavery, Jim Crow laws, and segregation. You don't spend the vast majority of your nation's history attempting to essentially 'drown' an entire racial group without expecting any repercussions. A similar society is South Africa, in which apartheid has essentially resulted in a great deal of the crime in their modern-day society. Certainly, in both nations, there's some individual-level, and inter-community issues, but when you spend centuries fucking over blacks, and then wonder why black crime rates are sky-high, it's kind of fucking obvious.\n\n&gt;You're confusing correlation with causation. Besides that, you cannot say the world is better off when violence is essentially monopolized by a global superpower just because there is less violence, which was also the case in corrupt communist regimes.\n\nA monopoly on violence is also essential to a harmonious state, and sub-international affairs. Cops can be good or bad, but a strong police force generally helps prevent petty crime, at the least. \n\nAdditionally, while the US is not a 'perfect' country, no nation is, and any of it's 'excesses' are farts in a hurricane compared to what the British, Chinese, Russians, and Japanese do, and have done.

Suddenly we need tanks and rather than just spitting them out rapid-fire we need to spend years and billions of dollars building a new factory AND relearning how to build them because much of the knowledge just disappeared when the old tank makers left. \n\nIt's just simply cheaper to keep making them and not using them rather than having to recreate the entire operation.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cc19b40", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1378258105", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cc08pry", "score": 8, "retrieved_on": 1429613977, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes, although it probably depends on what you mean by military presence.  If you mean simply the existence of a massive US military abroad, while possible that will take some time and is really dependent on a paradigm shift in our how we see military functioning abroad.\n\nThis shift is something that has been taking place since the end of the cold war, and if it was not for Afghanistan or Iraq, we would probably be even further down this road.  There was a growing consensus that the era of large scale military intervention like that of Vietnam and Korea is no longer an efficient or effective way of  asserting US foreign policy.  \n\nIt was shifting towards limited and pointed strikes like those in Libya and what we're likely to see in Syria.  Again the Iraq and to a lesser extent Afhanistan wars changed that, but the broader reality of military use in the world is bending away from such engagements for many of the reasons which are apparent from our engagements in those two wars. \n\nAdditionally, the development of international consensus regarding appropriate conduct involving conflict etc, is a big stabilizing factor.  As is, and this may be the most significant factor, the existence of a global capitalist economy.  Now more than ever the larger international communities' interests are intertwined and what we need to do is continue to develop instutions around these mutual interests (trade, technology, energy).  Both these will reduce the need for large scale military existance and use abroad in the long run.  \n\nCurrently, the maintenance of a cold war army such as the US is evident as being ill suited to our current world.  For example the US simply does not need the amount of M1 tanks it currently maintains, the reason it continues to do so is political, not military. \n\nThe restructuring of our military presence in places like S. Korea, Germany, Japan, etc. and our role as primary military actor for NATO is something that is unlikely to change until there has been a paradigm shift wherein large scale military action is almost never taken or seen as legitimate and the domestic political paradigm shifts to come into line with the post-cold war world in which we currently live.\n\nLastly, the question of China's rise is a potential kink in this change.

Nuclear Iran, and a destabilized Middle East, likely war with Israel.  Soon after a nuclear Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and possibly Iraq.  \n\nb)  Removal of troops stationed in Germany and South Korea, and the removal of our nuclear umbrella over those states.  Germany, Japan, and South Korea would arm (simply more so for S. Korea).

These three are just the first immediate and impact consequences, overall the global influence of the US and the West would be greatly reduced.\n\n2)  I don't really see this as an assumption of what he put forward above, which is, as he said, standard IR realist theory.  Having a military is certainly a deterrent, using the military is essential for giving your policies and national interests legitimacy worldwide.  The countries you named do not screw with serious US interests, they simply have built a domestic identity where their own legitimacy is stabilized through a BS \"defying\" of the US and dominent Western institutions. \n\n3)  Again, it is not so much that the military actions themselves are stabilizing but that the presence of a Hegemony who has legitimate threats to unwarranted conflict is certainly a stabilizing factor.  This also is going to heavily depend on what types of actions are taken and how they fit into the global scheme of balances of power.  Overall when action is taking to preserve or further balance new threats, the overall effect will be to stabilize, not destabilize. \n\nLastly the idea that al Qaeda is now synonymous with the Syrian rebel army is wrong.  Are they there?  Yes.  Are they the primary group or is their ideology fundamental to the movement?  No.  Action taken against Syria for massacring their own people with illegal weapons is not an action to \"assist al Qaeda\" like some conservatives have been saying.  That argument is more about trying to undermine Obama than it is about anything going on in Syria. \n\n", "edited": 1378146650, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ljdbk", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cc06lfc", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1378127253", "ups": 25, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cc07bkk", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "RegisteringIsHard", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cc07ehn", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cc07bkk", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1429616634, "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": 1380281544, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ljdbk", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cc07ehn", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1378131071", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ljdbk", "id": "t1_cc07jyg", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "painfully_boring", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cc07bkk", "score": 6, "retrieved_on": 1429616563, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;Argentina is making threats against Britain over the Falklands\n\nThis is exactly why the Falklands War happened the first time.

But you can't ignore the cons and only discuss the pros. That's cherry picking and leads to faulty conclusions.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of nations enforcing their own national interests is part of the problem. This creates a Prisoners Dilemma which is characterized by the property that everyone working in their own *proximate* best interest will (must!) always result in a worse case for every individual than if the bound themselves to a solution that is in *everyone's* best interests. (See [this discussion](http://adnausi.ca/post/13836082407) on how and why that happens in a Prisoners Dilemma.)\n\nAs in the above link, the solution to this \"best interests\" problem is for everyone to bind themselves to a common goal with enforceable punishments for choosing personal interest against the common interest. In societies we call that organization an elected government (laws, police). In international relations, it is the UN that we try to have fill this role.\n\nSo if the U.S. wanted to truly optimize its *ultimate* best interests it should cease acting alone and bind itself to act only with UN approval.

First off, not intervening militarily in Syria is not exactly the same thing as 'allowing' them to use chemical weapons, since there are a whole load of other legal options which can demonstrate the international community's condemnation of their use. It's highly unlikely that these would be successful, but then on the flip side there's no guarantee that intervention would prevent the use of chemical weapons, and could conceivably make the Syrian government more likely to use them, so the only purpose of intervention would be to 'send a message', which is certainly not an adequate justification for the use of force. The Chemical Weapons Convention is an important statement of the US and the rest of the international community's condemnation of the proliferation and use of these weapons, but it's important to recognise that the convention itself doesn't allow unilateral use of military force as an enforcement mechanism, and such use of force is prohibited by the UN Charter and as a norm of international law on the prohibition of the use of force in general. The only means by which a state is permitted to use force adhering to current international norms is either a) with Security Council approval or b) in self-defense. Period. Claiming to be enforcing a treaty or convention is not grounds for unilateral military action.\n\nIf we're talking about messages we're sending to other states and the world then it's important to recognise what sorts of messages these sorts of unilateral actions also send - it demonstrates that the US isn't serious about international rule of law, because it applies its principles arbitrarily and when it suits them. Let's not forget that the Syrian government has been carrying out atrocities which, in sense of prohibitions in international law, are as grave crimes as the use of chemical weapons. The prohibition of torture, for instance, is not just a norm in international law, but a peremptory one - that is, it's up there with genocide and the use of chemical weapons (which would fall under the umbrella of 'war crimes') in its restriction. \n\nThe fact of the matter is that the Syrian government has been carrying out war crimes of an equally grave nature for nearly two years now, and it's not unfair that some people smell a rat when chemical weapons are treated as a 'red line' on which to justify military intervention. A claim that the US is enforcing international law just isn't credible - the Syrian government has been violating international law for a very long time. Claims of reciprocity (if we let them do it, they'll do it to us) don't stand, because the exact same thing can be said about the use of torture, which the US itself engaged in not so long ago.

The 'proof is in the pudding' as it is, simply looking at China's history of engagement with issues within and exterior to its perceived sphere of influence will demonstrate that they become very touchy when it comes to internal matters within that sphere (Tibet, Taiwan). \n\nChina's strategy is to discourage foreign interventions at basically every chance they get. Again, the evidence is present if you look at their votes and vetoes at the Security Council. They only reason they actually allowed Libya to get past the UNSC was because NATO 'promised' limited strikes and a no-fly zone. NATO broke its promise and China hasn't forgotten - hence their even more rigid approach to Syria.\n\n", "id": "t1_cbxcvf6", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "ThornyPlebeian", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cbxe4ql", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "quintus_horatius", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1lahd0", "id": "t1_cbxjrn2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Sanic3", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cbxe4ql", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429662006, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yep.
