That city has grown immensely in the last 20 years, and it is in the desert.

We know the water evaporates much faster in AZ than Colorado so we now have empty lakes in CO and that water is nowhere to be accounted for. Does that impact climate change? If so, could we legislatively slow the growth in AZ, or is that politically impossible, even though it would be a factor in climate change?   \nAdd on the fact that a few people will rake in huge sums of money selling carbon offsets, that the government will require companies to purchase, is a situation ripe for corruption.\n\nBTW - in my lifetime, less than 50 years,  I've lived through the threat of global cooling, then global warming, and now it's climate change.

While this is appealing because it allows for more individual choice and customization according to needs it also carries the dangers of adverse selection and defeats one of the main points of the ACA.\n\nWhen there are tiers will choose their coverage and payments according to health states. Through adverse selection there is a strong danger of a death spiral. Essentially instead of being fully covered (i will assume this is the top tier), healthy individuals will choose one of the lowest tiers. Accordingly those who are still paying for full coverage will end up paying more since on average in this full coverage group people are less healthy i.e. they need more procedures. In response some of people who are moderately healthy will also choose a lower tier instead of paying higher rates. This again raises the prices and leads to the aforementioned death spiral. This is a situation where due to selection the costs go up for those who most need the procedures. This essentially defies the point of insurance since these unhealthy individual are still fronting a large portion of the bill or in other words their insurance is not that great.\n\nBy forcing everybody into the healthcare system regardless of health status they are able to pool and by extension spread the costs. While this poses other risks in the form of moral hazard (more incentives to over-treat since you are not bearing the full costs), it is arguably better for society by providing suitable healthcare for everybody and other benefits related to coverage like more work mobility since it will not be less tied to employment.\n\nLong story short allowing a multi-tiered system, while still forcing everybody into the healthcare system, would lead to a similar situation as today.\n\nWhile it is true that Obama has gotten in bed with the healthcare companies we still have to acknowledge the ACA would likely not have passed without this, and there are other better examples of the problem their personal interests led to.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ca0szqu", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1368822314", "ups": 7, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t3_1ej4my", "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1431123130, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ca0sjed", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1368821014", "ups": 4, "distinguished": null}

And the only thing that is different is that, after Obama apologized, after Clinton apologized and resigned, after a few other people resigned as well I believe, we are still talking about this issue but with no new information, nothing additional. \n\nNo one is being impeachment charges, no one really seems to be doing anything except scoring cheap political points. \n\nWhats sad is that large swaths of this country are buying the propaganda that this is somehow bigger than actively using the office of the presidency to commit crimes, to cover those crimes up by destroying evidence and lying while under oath. \n\nClinton lied under oath, it was right to bring impeachment charges against him even if they didn't go anywhere. Nixon committed crimes in the office of the presidency, lied under oath and was caught. It was right to impeach Nixon. But no one is making the motion to impeach Obama and no one has provided evidence that Obama either lied under oath, or even real evidence that the state department could have prevented this action.\n\nLet us not forget that it was congress that took funding from the security measures of the diplomatic missions, and let us also not forget that this was not a full embassy that was attacked, which often do not have the same security levels of an embassy.\n\nAccording to PBS(http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2012/09/securing-embassies.html):\n&gt; The embassy in Tripoli is a fairly new facility. It was constructed in 2009 in accordance with security standards established by the Diplomatic Security Service at the State Department. The building in Benghazi was basically a villa that was being rented to serve as a temporary consulate. So it was built in accordance with your normal residential security standards for Libya. It was not made to withstand rocket or bomb attacks. So it was not a very secure facility at all.\n\nYou throw 150 guys at a civilian residence, with rockets, grenades, and what not, and it is very likely that someone is going to get killed. What should be noted is the testament to our own security forces that only 4 were killed. \n\nThe truly legitimate questions that should be asked are why weren't troops sent in earlier (mind you they were sent in) and what was the break-down in security that led to missed warning, which there were a few. \n\nTo argue this was preventable is to argue with hindsight and ignore the legitimate difficulties in securing our diplomatic objectives across the globe. There are threats that come in every day, and it is a nightmare of a task deciding what is a credible threat and what is not. \n\nThis was a major failing of the Obama administration on security, one that I am fairly certain was met with rage by the administration internally and one that is being dealt with to fix these issues moving forward. \n\nBut lets not also forget that there were 50+ attacks on our embassies and diplomatic missions under Bush, and we never saw such controversy. And we know for certain that he lied to the American people to get us into war. Those lies are documented.  So when you act like some how Obama is getting a slide by the media please remember the following:\n* News Corp. is the largest media producer in the country when talking about news. Its products reach more consumers than any of the other media outlets. It is not only a part of the MSM, it by definition is the main stream. \n* Obama has been slammed since before he was president by their products, and has not had a day in the 4yrs, 100 days that hes been president, where he wasn't \"utterly destroyed\" by News Corp products.\n* Bush and Cheney, while investigated to some extent, have not had to suffer the same vitriol of congress and the MSM for their actions which led to over 200K people being killed, many who had done no wrong to warrant death by America. \n\nThis idea that somehow Obama has gotten off free about Benghazi is a propaganda'ed mess and is nothing but a fallacy.

Politics is hyper-partisan right now, and every elected feels that they constantly have a target on their back, no matter how well they are representing the constituency. Money plays too big a role as well.

That's a lot of short-term pain during already hard times in order to prevent....what....? Slower, phased-in pain during better economic times?\n\nIf you believe in the business cycle, you believe that a \"boom\" is always a few years off. The key is to get taxes high and spending low when the boom occurs. And when the bust occurs, get taxes lower and spending higher.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8md20i", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361933207", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_19aen9", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c8mgws3", "parent_id": "t3_19aen9", "score": -5, "retrieved_on": 1431424298, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Not in the US.

For example what is a better return on investment, dollars spent to the military industrial complex or dollars into educations. I am not even talking about waste as both of those examples have numerous anecdotes of high inefficiency. I am questioning the general idea because it seems to me that feeding the military complex just increases its size and reliance in the future with the benefit of increased monetary supply in the present. Whereas social spending would seem to have a similar stimulating effect with the added benefit of increased standard of living for our people and better equipped workers in the future.\n\nBut the target of spending aside I think that sort of classical Keynesian approach is outmoded when compared to how I understand the New Keynesian ideology of working to stabilize natural market fluctuations through intelligent monetary and fiscal policy rather than attempt to guide such highs and lows through policy.
