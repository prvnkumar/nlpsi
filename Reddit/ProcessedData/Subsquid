I have no clue exactly how PRISM operates, beyond the specific admissions that it has at least twice gathered information deemed so invasive they destroyed it.\n\nWhat I reacted negatively to was your preemptive assertion that Greenwald was all wrong based on nothing more than an admin. sourced \"anonymous\" leak. If you enjoy a secret police state literally spying on domestic citizens under the oversight of a secret and unelected court and legislators sworn to secrecy under threat of imprisonment, you are overly credulous to say the least. Now is not the time to start trying to ameloriate any claim at all. Even if Greenwald's claims are patently false, the only reason we know ANYTHING about this is because of them.\n\n&gt;None of these were conspiracies. And none of them are relevant, \n&gt;either. The very fact that you list them as conspiracies reveals quite \n&gt;a bit about your credibility.\n\nEvery single instance I listed, literally followed a pattern of the admin. and apologists like you laughing at the implications of initial charges, dismissing the inquisitive as conspiracy theorists and followed by revelations that the admin. lied in an attempt to shape public perception in that direction. From false leaks, to outright lying to the press even on TV, to planted questions, there have been a string of events involving admin. fuckups and pure agitprop coverups to follow. When does the burden of proof shift against this admin.? How many major embarrassments do you need before it's time to wait and see what gets revealed BEFORE you start trying to shush everyone into silence?\n\nAnd what do you mean none of those were \"conspiracies\"? Do you even know what the noun means? At least three of the five look to be literal conspiracies and the others are just published examples of an elected admin. getting caught lying publicly multiple times, which while not illegal [I think] sure does look like shit.\n\n&gt;Which means... checks and balances are working, no?\n\nRight, no. Because he had to agitate and I am assuming raise hell just to publicly raise the vaguest of objections that no one understood or paid attention to with out getting jailed for violating some secrecy oath. Sure, people recalled his bitching now, but ...\n\n&gt;Why? Because conspiracy theories?\n\nYou've missed out on Carney modifying every unconditional denial he's made right after another leak proves him a liar?

Further it was claimed widely and publicly in a media blitz that there was no evidence of premeditation of the attack.\n\nWhat not only Republicans are trying to prove is that the administration ignored forewarning of the attack from a variety of intelligence sources, requests from the ambassador for increased security, warning from Libyan sources about 48 hours in advance of the attack and a notification from a group providing security in Benghazi that it would no longer do so, and a further rejection by them to a direct request to provide some just for Stevens' visit.\n\nBasically, State dept. incompetence set the stage for the disaster.\n\nDuring the attack, local military assets were denied authorization to go help.\n\nAfterwards, a now documented campaign of misinformation was begun. The CIA provided the State Department with a memo of talking points summarizing knowledge and assumption about what had occurred. It mentioned Anshar al-Sharia's involvement through intelligence sources, Islamic extremism and other evidence of premeditation.\n\nState rejected it and rejected at least one revision right off. A documented email from a White House official said that all would have to be hashed out at the WH. So one CIA official went to the WH to meet with a State Department official and WH officials. During the course of apparently 12 revisions, all reference to Islamic extremism and terrorism was scrubbed from the report. A now public email from Victoria Nuland of the State Dept. said basically to get rid of all references to terrorism 'so Congress can't abuse us with claims that we ignored warnings.' So the coverup is in fact, already documented publicly.\n\nNext Susan Rice, Ambassador to the UN, and presumptive nominee for Secretary of State did a Sunday talk circuit saying we had no indication of premeditation and blaming this Youtube film. Jay Carney, the president's spokesman said the same. Victoria Nuland said the same.\n\nSo despite the first CIA report, all manner of concrete evidence they ignored and all manner of verification after the fact, including Darryl Hicks, Chris Stevens' 2nd in command in Libya, and the president of Libya all pointing to this being a premeditated attack and Islamic terrorism, US gov't officials deliberately misinformed the public about what happened, and also stonewalled and pretended to know less than it is documented that they did.\n\nThey did this against the backdrop of a presidential race so close that the Obama admin. was drafting rules to put in place should Romney win.\n\nSo the evidence is fair that: \n\n- the Benghazi disaster was a direct result of security mismanagement and ignoring intelligence offered all the way up to Hillary.\n\n- the CIA was informing gov't officials as early as 24 hours later the attack was terrorist; the Libyan president said the same on CNN; State had a variety of sources confirming that\n\n- the president's spokesman lied directly that only one small stylistic change was made to the talking points report when in fact it went through 12 revisions and deleted all direct terrorism references\n\n- the president's spokesman and 2 different State Dept. officials, including one with a direct hand in the revisions,  all went on national television and denied that we had forewarning of the attacks, indications of premeditation of the attacks and that our BEST intelligence pointed to this being a demonstration gone bad. All now not only demonstrably false, but known to be false at the time by all three.\n\n**tl;dr State Dept. messed up bad and then shat all over the memories of those who got killed through their incompetence by trying to deflect blame and outright lies, in service of covering their asses and protecting the president in a close race.

It's a police state\n\nYou've obviously never been to China from this comment alone. Chinese people are very up front and honest about things, one of the first they they ask you in small talk is how much you make. We flat out asked one of our guides on a later leg of the trip about Tienanmen (Not Tiannamen, more correctly \u5929\u5b89\u95e8) and she said she wasn't comfortable talking about it much, but that most Chinese knew the entire story and it wasn't a hushed affair. Later we asked our tour guide in Guangdong (First one was in Beijing) and he openly talked about it, as did my host family.\n\n&gt;When your neighbor can turn your ass in for thoughtcrime\n\nYou're grasping for straws that aren't there.\n\n&gt;You have no clue.\n\nNo, you have no clue. You know an acquaintance who bought a slave in China. I've traveled extensively from Beijing to Hong Kong and talked to normal people.

Those comments came **after** evidence already pointed to a distinct militant attack.\"\n\nNow how that debunks anything is up to you. Especially the part where it specifically criticizes blaming the filmmaker in the face of available evidence.\n\n&gt;Despite those (leadership and management) deficiencies, the board \n&gt;determined that no individual officials ignored or violated their duties \n&gt;and recommended no disciplinary action. \n\nThe next sentence being:\n\n\"But it also said poor performance by senior managers should be grounds for disciplinary recommendations in the future.\"\n\nMeaning that FUBAR is not grounds for firing in D.C. Because the report characterizes the security failures as \"senior level mismanagement\" resulting in \"gross inadequacy\" to protect lives. What? The independent report couldn't figure out who was who to find out where the mismanagement came from but knew it was senior?\n\nEveryone involved gets a mulligan for the first instance of getting people killed, and it only threatens disciplinary recommendation for further failures like an event that objectively cost four people's lives. That line right there concedes management failed. If anything should enrage you it should be the line you quoted with the sentence that immediately followed that you coincidentally didn't quote.\n\n&gt;blaming those managers for the failure that Congress guaranteed by \n&gt;their withholding of proper funds. THAT is the Benghazi scandal. \n\nNonsense! If your charge is safeguarding lives, this excuse is total garbage; close the embassy, if you can't safeguard lives. I can say that as a manager at a retail store, just a bit less important than the US diplomatic corps, I wouldn't accept or offer lack of funding as an excuse for endangering employees with broken stepladders, much less oooo, funding's tight so let's let ignore plain terror threat warnings from a variety of sources and use local guards with little or no training or vetting.

There had been specific tactical warnings of planned attacks on Benghazi from a variety of sources.

There had been specific tactical warnings of planned attacks on Benghazi from a variety of sources.

And ideally the Jews would just leave in \n&gt;such a situation.\n\nIt's in their rights to drive them out through every means but denial of economic association now, which is a lot, sufficient to make me want to leave. You move to a town, armed with your anti-discrim. laws, and discover that despite legal prohibitions from refusing you a job, trade, etc., 95% of the town thought you were bad for your love of anti-discrim. laws, excluded you from everything they legally could, and socially ostracized you. Every protected trade was accompanied by \"Here's your change you statist fiend may you fry in egalitarian hell.\" How happy would you be to mutually benefit the townsfolk w/ the trade of the limited time of your life? Like I said, my first move on encountering organized bigotry you fear, with or without the presence of anti-discrimination laws, would be to leave. \n\nSo my point is that the anti-discrimination laws provide no relevant benefit over the proposed change. The point is moot.\n\nReally my objection to your thought here is that anti-discrimination laws through the agency of allowing gov't to deny freedom of association offer at best minor protection from the force of ostracism  a group could deploy against any minority. There's a big cost and a minor benefit, incredibly minor as it wouldn't change my behavior in the least.\n\nMore importantly, you completely dodged the fact that **without** anti-discimination laws, your fears about some community completely freezing out a given group have already proven ahistorical. Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher. I'm not saying to reject AD laws because they don't eliminate all bigotry. I'm saying reject them because they eliminate so little bigotry they aren't worth the cost.\n\n&gt;is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without \n&gt;fear of consequence.\n\nRunning amok is a ludicrous phrase here. Yes, it would be a wanton denial of association. A wild, blood bath of refusal of trade. And that crazed lunatic would still face the open censure of everyone who thought that mindset was stupid, and the implicit cost of loss of business. It's not like there's a lot of history here, about how people can prosper in hostile majority societies and boycotts can negatively impact bigoted businesses.\n\n&gt;As long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.\n\nNo, even a freed slave in the deep South would have seen a benefit from increased buying power, especially them actually.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Yup.

That's been the case for a looong time before the civil rights movement in the 60's. Jewish folks didn't have religious strictures against lending at interest; their relative freedom of contract led to material success; they tended to become doctors, lawyers and other skilled professional jobs with high earning potential and they did this for a long time before any laws tried to codify anti-discrimination.\n\nI'd prefer bigotry out in the open, to the hidden, de facto racism that you are powerless to stop anyway. At least then we'd have an open debate, rather than a bunch of embittered bigots going right on with their messed up epistemology but hidden beneath a veneer of compliance. In this tolerant paradise the 60's civil rights laws have created, 60 years later, people still gravitate to like ethnic communities and I still encounter overt, ugly racism, sexism, etc., on a daily basis. I can tell you for a FACT that if we'd spent 60 years teaching logic as a core curriculum to kids in public school, racism would be a bizarre memory.\n\nThe problem with racism isn't the behavior, it's the mindset that underlies it. You're obsessed with the symptoms of it, when by and large the nastiest symptoms are already outlawed. You can't stab a Jewish person because you hate them; that's morally impermissible in all cases, and illegal for centuries. Refusing to do business just let's them know who their enemies are.

And ideally the Jews would just leave in such a situation.\n\n&gt; In this tolerant paradise the 60's civil rights laws have created, 60 years later, people still gravitate to like ethnic communities and I still encounter overt, ugly racism, sexism, etc., on a daily basis\n\nSo what?  It's way better than it used to be.  Pay gaps are narrowing.  Minority groups can actually get jobs.\n\nAnd are you seriously reminding me that racism still exists?  **I know racism still exists.  I know anti-discrimination laws don't eliminate 100% of racism.** Stop appealing to the Nirvana fallacy, it isn't convincing.  If you want to make the argument that the laws don't work, then make it.  Provide some evidence.\n\n&gt; The problem with racism isn't the behavior, it's the mindset that underlies it. \n\nThe symptoms are what actually hurt people and what we can actually regulate.  If people are secretly racist, that's bad.  But a secret racist who faces a threat of punishment whenever he tries to be racist in a recognizable way that affects other people is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without fear of consequence.\n\n&gt; Although as I pointed out, an increase in buying power will disproportionately benefit the poor, due to the diminishing marginal utility of cash.\n\nAs long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;So just to be clear: in your ideal society, if a town dislikes Jews, it is \n&gt;within their rights to openly drive all the Jews out of town through \n&gt;socioeconomic pressure. And ideally the Jews would just leave in \n&gt;such a situation.\n\nIt's in their rights to drive them out through every means but denial of economic association now, which is a lot, sufficient to make me want to leave. You move to a town, armed with your anti-discrim. laws, and discover that despite legal prohibitions from refusing you a job, trade, etc., 95% of the town thought you were bad for your love of anti-discrim. laws, excluded you from everything they legally could, and socially ostracized you. Every protected trade was accompanied by \"Here's your change you statist fiend may you fry in egalitarian hell.\" How happy would you be to mutually benefit the townsfolk w/ the trade of the limited time of your life? Like I said, my first move on encountering organized bigotry you fear, with or without the presence of anti-discrimination laws, would be to leave. \n\nSo my point is that the anti-discrimination laws provide no relevant benefit over the proposed change. The point is moot.\n\nReally my objection to your thought here is that anti-discrimination laws through the agency of allowing gov't to deny freedom of association offer at best minor protection from the force of ostracism  a group could deploy against any minority. There's a big cost and a minor benefit, incredibly minor as it wouldn't change my behavior in the least.\n\nMore importantly, you completely dodged the fact that **without** anti-discimination laws, your fears about some community completely freezing out a given group have already proven ahistorical. Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher. I'm not saying to reject AD laws because they don't eliminate all bigotry. I'm saying reject them because they eliminate so little bigotry they aren't worth the cost.\n\n&gt;is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without \n&gt;fear of consequence.\n\nRunning amok is a ludicrous phrase here. Yes, it would be a wanton denial of association. A wild, blood bath of refusal of trade. And that crazed lunatic would still face the open censure of everyone who thought that mindset was stupid, and the implicit cost of loss of business. It's not like there's a lot of history here, about how people can prosper in hostile majority societies and boycotts can negatively impact bigoted businesses.\n\n&gt;As long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.\n\nNo, even a freed slave in the deep South would have seen a benefit from increased buying power, especially them actually.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Yup.

That's been the case for a looong time before the civil rights movement in the 60's. Jewish folks didn't have religious strictures against lending at interest; their relative freedom of contract led to material success; they tended to become doctors, lawyers and other skilled professional jobs with high earning potential and they did this for a long time before any laws tried to codify anti-discrimination.\n\nI'd prefer bigotry out in the open, to the hidden, de facto racism that you are powerless to stop anyway.

There's a big cost and a minor benefit, incredibly minor as it wouldn't change my behavior in the least.\n\nMore importantly, you completely dodged the fact that **without** anti-discimination laws, your fears about some community completely freezing out a given group have already proven ahistorical. Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher. I'm not saying to reject AD laws because they don't eliminate all bigotry. I'm saying reject them because they eliminate so little bigotry they aren't worth the cost.\n\n&gt;is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without \n&gt;fear of consequence.\n\nRunning amok is a ludicrous phrase here. Yes, it would be a wanton denial of association. A wild, blood bath of refusal of trade. And that crazed lunatic would still face the open censure of everyone who thought that mindset was stupid, and the implicit cost of loss of business. It's not like there's a lot of history here, about how people can prosper in hostile majority societies and boycotts can negatively impact bigoted businesses.\n\n&gt;As long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.\n\nNo, even a freed slave in the deep South would have seen a benefit from increased buying power, especially them actually.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Yup. It's in their rights to drive them out through every means but denial of economic association now, which is a lot, sufficient to make me want to leave.\n\nI guess we just disagree over whether this is a good thing or not.

No transfer payments. No Fed. Prices would drop for almost everything. Buying power would increase. Since they have the least money, the poor would see the most gain from this.\n\n- Elimination of all inter- and intrastate trade barriers. Drops in health care insurance as markets open up to interstate competition. Drops in energy costs as state mandated energy monopolies go away. Elimination of all national and state monopolies and cartels, again causing a general price decrease.\n\n- The elimination of gov't interference in economy would also eliminate the motive to corrupt officials.

Legalization of prostitution, nullification of sodomy laws, public decency laws, etc. Nullification of any law preventing gambling. No more cartel influence over state gambling licensing.\n\n- Gov't itself would shrink massively. All that money would go back into productive segments of the economy; all the money blown on compliance, regulation, administration, enforcement, etc. of interventionism and welfare statism would go away, further contributing to both price drops and national productivity.\n\nThat should be enough of a laundry list.

Those with the highest socioeconomic status would enjoy them disproportionately, with marginalized minority groups at their mercy.  (I guess this is the idea?

The *first* thing I would do upon encountering a large group of people who were anti-me would be to get my family and me the hell away from them.\n\nThe people who've hated Jewish people have tended to hate them because among other things they are often hard workers, gravitate to jobs in demand and earn a lot of money even as they're being discriminated against. That's been the case for a looong time before the civil rights movement in the 60's. Jewish folks didn't have religious strictures against lending at interest; their relative freedom of contract led to material success; they tended to become doctors, lawyers and other skilled professional jobs with high earning potential and they did this for a long time before any laws tried to codify anti-discrimination.\n\nI'd prefer bigotry out in the open, to the hidden, de facto racism that you are powerless to stop anyway.

You can't stab a Jewish person because you hate them; that's morally impermissible in all cases, and illegal for centuries. Refusing to do business just let's them know who their enemies are. How much easier to put a face on bigotry and stigmatize it than if you publicized some fool refusing to serve X group?\n\nAnd yes, just like now in the status quo, the richest can pay for more material benefits.

Every protected trade was accompanied by \"Here's your change you statist fiend may you fry in egalitarian hell.\" How happy would you be to mutually benefit the townsfolk w/ the trade of the limited time of your life?

The point is moot.\n\nReally my objection to your thought here is that anti-discrimination laws through the agency of allowing gov't to deny freedom of association offer at best minor protection from the force of ostracism  a group could deploy against any minority. There's a big cost and a minor benefit, incredibly minor as it wouldn't change my behavior in the least.\n\nMore importantly, you completely dodged the fact that **without** anti-discimination laws, your fears about some community completely freezing out a given group have already proven ahistorical. Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher.

Yes, it would be a wanton denial of association. A wild, blood bath of refusal of trade. And that crazed lunatic would still face the open censure of everyone who thought that mindset was stupid, and the implicit cost of loss of business.

The *first* thing I would do upon encountering a large group of people who were anti-me would be to get my family and me the hell away from them.\n\nThe people who've hated Jewish people have tended to hate them because among other things they are often hard workers, gravitate to jobs in demand and earn a lot of money even as they're being discriminated against. That's been the case for a looong time before the civil rights movement in the 60's. Jewish folks didn't have religious strictures against lending at interest; their relative freedom of contract led to material success; they tended to become doctors, lawyers and other skilled professional jobs with high earning potential and they did this for a long time before any laws tried to codify anti-discrimination.\n\nI'd prefer bigotry out in the open, to the hidden, de facto racism that you are powerless to stop anyway. At least then we'd have an open debate, rather than a bunch of embittered bigots going right on with their messed up epistemology but hidden beneath a veneer of compliance. In this tolerant paradise the 60's civil rights laws have created, 60 years later, people still gravitate to like ethnic communities and I still encounter overt, ugly racism, sexism, etc., on a daily basis. I can tell you for a FACT that if we'd spent 60 years teaching logic as a core curriculum to kids in public school, racism would be a bizarre memory.\n\nThe problem with racism isn't the behavior, it's the mindset that underlies it. You're obsessed with the symptoms of it, when by and large the nastiest symptoms are already outlawed. You can't stab a Jewish person because you hate them; that's morally impermissible in all cases, and illegal for centuries. Refusing to do business just let's them know who their enemies are. How much easier to put a face on bigotry and stigmatize it than if you publicized some fool refusing to serve X group?\n\nAnd yes, just like now in the status quo, the richest can pay for more material benefits. So that's a wash. Although as I pointed out, an increase in buying power will disproportionately benefit the poor, due to the diminishing marginal utility of cash.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1cxzw6", "selftext": "&gt; There wouldn't be a local group \"in power,\" that's the point. \n\nWho is going to stop them?\n\n&gt; Anyone who could pay would have the right to buy whatever house they wanted. If you are envisioning group X being ostracized, why would group X want to live with, socialize with and benefit a community mostly composed of people who hated them and tried to marginalize them?\n\nSo just to be clear: in your ideal society, if a town dislikes Jews, it is within their rights to openly drive all the Jews out of town through socioeconomic pressure.  And ideally the Jews would just leave in such a situation.\n\n&gt; In this tolerant paradise the 60's civil rights laws have created, 60 years later, people still gravitate to like ethnic communities and I still encounter overt, ugly racism, sexism, etc., on a daily basis\n\nSo what?  It's way better than it used to be.  Pay gaps are narrowing.  Minority groups can actually get jobs.\n\nAnd are you seriously reminding me that racism still exists?  **I know racism still exists.  I know anti-discrimination laws don't eliminate 100% of racism.** Stop appealing to the Nirvana fallacy, it isn't convincing.  If you want to make the argument that the laws don't work, then make it.  Provide some evidence.\n\n&gt; The problem with racism isn't the behavior, it's the mindset that underlies it. \n\nThe symptoms are what actually hurt people and what we can actually regulate.  If people are secretly racist, that's bad.  But a secret racist who faces a threat of punishment whenever he tries to be racist in a recognizable way that affects other people is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without fear of consequence.\n\n&gt; Although as I pointed out, an increase in buying power will disproportionately benefit the poor, due to the diminishing marginal utility of cash.\n\nAs long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;So just to be clear: in your ideal society, if a town dislikes Jews, it is \n&gt;within their rights to openly drive all the Jews out of town through \n&gt;socioeconomic pressure. And ideally the Jews would just leave in \n&gt;such a situation.\n\nIt's in their rights to drive them out through every means but denial of economic association now, which is a lot, sufficient to make me want to leave. You move to a town, armed with your anti-discrim. laws, and discover that despite legal prohibitions from refusing you a job, trade, etc., 95% of the town thought you were bad for your love of anti-discrim. laws, excluded you from everything they legally could, and socially ostracized you. Every protected trade was accompanied by \"Here's your change you statist fiend may you fry in egalitarian hell.\" How happy would you be to mutually benefit the townsfolk w/ the trade of the limited time of your life? Like I said, my first move on encountering organized bigotry you fear, with or without the presence of anti-discrimination laws, would be to leave. \n\nSo my point is that the anti-discrimination laws provide no relevant benefit over the proposed change. The point is moot.\n\nReally my objection to your thought here is that anti-discrimination laws through the agency of allowing gov't to deny freedom of association offer at best minor protection from the force of ostracism  a group could deploy against any minority. There's a big cost and a minor benefit, incredibly minor as it wouldn't change my behavior in the least.\n\nMore importantly, you completely dodged the fact that **without** anti-discimination laws, your fears about some community completely freezing out a given group have already proven ahistorical. Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher. I'm not saying to reject AD laws because they don't eliminate all bigotry. I'm saying reject them because they eliminate so little bigotry they aren't worth the cost.\n\n&gt;is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without \n&gt;fear of consequence.\n\nRunning amok is a ludicrous phrase here. Yes, it would be a wanton denial of association. A wild, blood bath of refusal of trade. And that crazed lunatic would still face the open censure of everyone who thought that mindset was stupid, and the implicit cost of loss of business. It's not like there's a lot of history here, about how people can prosper in hostile majority societies and boycotts can negatively impact bigoted businesses.\n\n&gt;As long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.\n\nNo, even a freed slave in the deep South would have seen a benefit from increased buying power, especially them actually.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Yup.

No transfer payments. No Fed. Prices would drop for almost everything. Buying power would increase. Since they have the least money, the poor would see the most gain from this.\n\n- Elimination of all inter- and intrastate trade barriers. Drops in health care insurance as markets open up to interstate competition. Drops in energy costs as state mandated energy monopolies go away. Elimination of all national and state monopolies and cartels, again causing a general price decrease.\n\n- The elimination of gov't interference in economy would also eliminate the motive to corrupt officials. If you remove the money from their purview, there's no more point in dumping all that cash into bribes, political advertising, etc.\n\n- Unions lose ability to legally force unionization, but gain right to strike at will.

Legalization of prostitution, nullification of sodomy laws, public decency laws, etc. Nullification of any law preventing gambling. No more cartel influence over state gambling licensing.\n\n- Gov't itself would shrink massively. All that money would go back into productive segments of the economy; all the money blown on compliance, regulation, administration, enforcement, etc. of interventionism and welfare statism would go away, further contributing to both price drops and national productivity.\n\nThat should be enough of a laundry list.

However, we can end the war on drugs without a return to rampant and open racism, sexism, etc. and the sacrifice of the basic human rights like healthcare that I have come to enjoy.  \n\nFurthermore, the \"benefits\" you describe would be conditional.  Those with the highest socioeconomic status would enjoy them disproportionately, with marginalized minority groups at their mercy.  (I guess this is the idea?

The *first* thing I would do upon encountering a large group of people who were anti-me would be to get my family and me the hell away from them.\n\nThe people who've hated Jewish people have tended to hate them because among other things they are often hard workers, gravitate to jobs in demand and earn a lot of money even as they're being discriminated against. That's been the case for a looong time before the civil rights movement in the 60's. Jewish folks didn't have religious strictures against lending at interest; their relative freedom of contract led to material success; they tended to become doctors, lawyers and other skilled professional jobs with high earning potential and they did this for a long time before any laws tried to codify anti-discrimination.\n\nI'd prefer bigotry out in the open, to the hidden, de facto racism that you are powerless to stop anyway. At least then we'd have an open debate, rather than a bunch of embittered bigots going right on with their messed up epistemology but hidden beneath a veneer of compliance.

I can tell you for a FACT that if we'd spent 60 years teaching logic as a core curriculum to kids in public school, racism would be a bizarre memory.\n\nThe problem with racism isn't the behavior, it's the mindset that underlies it. You're obsessed with the symptoms of it, when by and large the nastiest symptoms are already outlawed. You can't stab a Jewish person because you hate them; that's morally impermissible in all cases, and illegal for centuries. Refusing to do business just let's them know who their enemies are. How much easier to put a face on bigotry and stigmatize it than if you publicized some fool refusing to serve X group?\n\nAnd yes, just like now in the status quo, the richest can pay for more material benefits.

You move to a town, armed with your anti-discrim. laws, and discover that despite legal prohibitions from refusing you a job, trade, etc., 95% of the town thought you were bad for your love of anti-discrim. laws, excluded you from everything they legally could, and socially ostracized you. Every protected trade was accompanied by \"Here's your change you statist fiend may you fry in egalitarian hell.\" How happy would you be to mutually benefit the townsfolk w/ the trade of the limited time of your life? Like I said, my first move on encountering organized bigotry you fear, with or without the presence of anti-discrimination laws, would be to leave. \n\nSo my point is that the anti-discrimination laws provide no relevant benefit over the proposed change. The point is moot.\n\nReally my objection to your thought here is that anti-discrimination laws through the agency of allowing gov't to deny freedom of association offer at best minor protection from the force of ostracism  a group could deploy against any minority. There's a big cost and a minor benefit, incredibly minor as it wouldn't change my behavior in the least.\n\nMore importantly, you completely dodged the fact that **without** anti-discimination laws, your fears about some community completely freezing out a given group have already proven ahistorical. Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher. I'm not saying to reject AD laws because they don't eliminate all bigotry. I'm saying reject them because they eliminate so little bigotry they aren't worth the cost.\n\n&gt;is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without \n&gt;fear of consequence.\n\nRunning amok is a ludicrous phrase here. Yes, it would be a wanton denial of association. A wild, blood bath of refusal of trade. And that crazed lunatic would still face the open censure of everyone who thought that mindset was stupid, and the implicit cost of loss of business. It's not like there's a lot of history here, about how people can prosper in hostile majority societies and boycotts can negatively impact bigoted businesses.\n\n&gt;As long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.\n\nNo, even a freed slave in the deep South would have seen a benefit from increased buying power, especially them actually.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Yup.

Lack of community with people who hated them never appeared to be particularly hurtful to the Jewish community. They just went ahead and found useful, well paying jobs to learn and excel at.

No transfer payments. No Fed. Prices would drop for almost everything. Buying power would increase. Since they have the least money, the poor would see the most gain from this.\n\n- Elimination of all inter- and intrastate trade barriers. Drops in health care insurance as markets open up to interstate competition. Drops in energy costs as state mandated energy monopolies go away. Elimination of all national and state monopolies and cartels, again causing a general price decrease.\n\n- The elimination of gov't interference in economy would also eliminate the motive to corrupt officials.

Those with the highest socioeconomic status would enjoy them disproportionately, with marginalized minority groups at their mercy.  (I guess this is the idea?

People stratify right now to avoid that. The *first* thing I would do upon encountering a large group of people who were anti-me would be to get my family and me the hell away from them.\n\nThe people who've hated Jewish people have tended to hate them because among other things they are often hard workers, gravitate to jobs in demand and earn a lot of money even as they're being discriminated against. That's been the case for a looong time before the civil rights movement in the 60's. Jewish folks didn't have religious strictures against lending at interest; their relative freedom of contract led to material success; they tended to become doctors, lawyers and other skilled professional jobs with high earning potential and they did this for a long time before any laws tried to codify anti-discrimination.\n\nI'd prefer bigotry out in the open, to the hidden, de facto racism that you are powerless to stop anyway. At least then we'd have an open debate, rather than a bunch of embittered bigots going right on with their messed up epistemology but hidden beneath a veneer of compliance.

I can tell you for a FACT that if we'd spent 60 years teaching logic as a core curriculum to kids in public school, racism would be a bizarre memory.\n\nThe problem with racism isn't the behavior, it's the mindset that underlies it. You're obsessed with the symptoms of it, when by and large the nastiest symptoms are already outlawed. You can't stab a Jewish person because you hate them; that's morally impermissible in all cases, and illegal for centuries. Refusing to do business just let's them know who their enemies are. How much easier to put a face on bigotry and stigmatize it than if you publicized some fool refusing to serve X group?\n\nAnd yes, just like now in the status quo, the richest can pay for more material benefits.

Every protected trade was accompanied by \"Here's your change you statist fiend may you fry in egalitarian hell.\" How happy would you be to mutually benefit the townsfolk w/ the trade of the limited time of your life? Like I said, my first move on encountering organized bigotry you fear, with or without the presence of anti-discrimination laws, would be to leave. \n\nSo my point is that the anti-discrimination laws provide no relevant benefit over the proposed change. The point is moot.\n\nReally my objection to your thought here is that anti-discrimination laws through the agency of allowing gov't to deny freedom of association offer at best minor protection from the force of ostracism  a group could deploy against any minority. There's a big cost and a minor benefit, incredibly minor as it wouldn't change my behavior in the least.\n\nMore importantly, you completely dodged the fact that **without** anti-discimination laws, your fears about some community completely freezing out a given group have already proven ahistorical. Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher. I'm not saying to reject AD laws because they don't eliminate all bigotry. I'm saying reject them because they eliminate so little bigotry they aren't worth the cost.\n\n&gt;is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without \n&gt;fear of consequence.\n\nRunning amok is a ludicrous phrase here. Yes, it would be a wanton denial of association. A wild, blood bath of refusal of trade. And that crazed lunatic would still face the open censure of everyone who thought that mindset was stupid, and the implicit cost of loss of business. It's not like there's a lot of history here, about how people can prosper in hostile majority societies and boycotts can negatively impact bigoted businesses.\n\n&gt;As long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.\n\nNo, even a freed slave in the deep South would have seen a benefit from increased buying power, especially them actually.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Yup.

It's called a counter-example to your hypothesis. **What you claim will happen in the absence of laws that weren't passed until the 60's, historically did not happen.** The Jews did fine internationally right up until two governmental entities decided depriving them of the NEGATIVE rights was a good idea. Lack of community with people who hated them never appeared to be particularly hurtful to the Jewish community. They just went ahead and found useful, well paying jobs to learn and excel at. When the governments started messing with their negative rights to property, life and liberty, yeah things got ugly then.\n\n&gt;What counter example?\n\nJudaism for the 501st time.\n\n&gt;...except for all the ones that didn't.\n\nMeaning whom?

I think most children can attest to that fact.\n\nReally my only answer to this is that, long term, being an adult is more rewarding. Oh and that authoritarian governments inevitably, throughout human history, turn bad and the liberty ceded to the authority for security bites you in the ass and fails to produce either. That's not a particularly new observation, nor is it one that has any observed counter-examples of which I am aware.\n\nThe incipient bankruptcy of the European [not to mention the American] welfare

No transfer payments. No Fed. Prices would drop for almost everything. Buying power would increase. Since they have the least money, the poor would see the most gain from this.\n\n- Elimination of all inter- and intrastate trade barriers. Drops in health care insurance as markets open up to interstate competition. Drops in energy costs as state mandated energy monopolies go away. Elimination of all national and state monopolies and cartels, again causing a general price decrease.\n\n- The elimination of gov't interference in economy would also eliminate the motive to corrupt officials.

Legalization of prostitution, nullification of sodomy laws, public decency laws, etc. Nullification of any law preventing gambling. No more cartel influence over state gambling licensing.\n\n- Gov't itself would shrink massively. All that money would go back into productive segments of the economy; all the money blown on compliance, regulation, administration, enforcement, etc. of interventionism and welfare statism would go away, further contributing to both price drops and national productivity.\n\nThat should be enough of a laundry list.

Those with the highest socioeconomic status would enjoy them disproportionately, with marginalized minority groups at their mercy.  (I guess this is the idea?

People stratify right now to avoid that. The *first* thing I would do upon encountering a large group of people who were anti-me would be to get my family and me the hell away from them.\n\nThe people who've hated Jewish people have tended to hate them because among other things they are often hard workers, gravitate to jobs in demand and earn a lot of money even as they're being discriminated against. That's been the case for a looong time before the civil rights movement in the 60's. Jewish folks didn't have religious strictures against lending at interest; their relative freedom of contract led to material success; they tended to become doctors, lawyers and other skilled professional jobs with high earning potential and they did this for a long time before any laws tried to codify anti-discrimination.\n\nI'd prefer bigotry out in the open, to the hidden, de facto racism that you are powerless to stop anyway. At least then we'd have an open debate, rather than a bunch of embittered bigots going right on with their messed up epistemology but hidden beneath a veneer of compliance. In this tolerant paradise the 60's civil rights laws have created, 60 years later, people still gravitate to like ethnic communities and I still encounter overt, ugly racism, sexism, etc., on a daily basis. I can tell you for a FACT that if we'd spent 60 years teaching logic as a core curriculum to kids in public school, racism would be a bizarre memory.\n\nThe problem with racism isn't the behavior, it's the mindset that underlies it. You're obsessed with the symptoms of it, when by and large the nastiest symptoms are already outlawed. You can't stab a Jewish person because you hate them; that's morally impermissible in all cases, and illegal for centuries. Refusing to do business just let's them know who their enemies are. How much easier to put a face on bigotry and stigmatize it than if you publicized some fool refusing to serve X group?\n\nAnd yes, just like now in the status quo, the richest can pay for more material benefits.

You move to a town, armed with your anti-discrim. laws, and discover that despite legal prohibitions from refusing you a job, trade, etc., 95% of the town thought you were bad for your love of anti-discrim. laws, excluded you from everything they legally could, and socially ostracized you. Every protected trade was accompanied by \"Here's your change you statist fiend may you fry in egalitarian hell.\" How happy would you be to mutually benefit the townsfolk w/ the trade of the limited time of your life? Like I said, my first move on encountering organized bigotry you fear, with or without the presence of anti-discrimination laws, would be to leave. \n\nSo my point is that the anti-discrimination laws provide no relevant benefit over the proposed change. The point is moot.\n\nReally my objection to your thought here is that anti-discrimination laws through the agency of allowing gov't to deny freedom of association offer at best minor protection from the force of ostracism  a group could deploy against any minority. There's a big cost and a minor benefit, incredibly minor as it wouldn't change my behavior in the least.\n\nMore importantly, you completely dodged the fact that **without** anti-discimination laws, your fears about some community completely freezing out a given group have already proven ahistorical. Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher. I'm not saying to reject AD laws because they don't eliminate all bigotry. I'm saying reject them because they eliminate so little bigotry they aren't worth the cost.\n\n&gt;is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without \n&gt;fear of consequence.\n\nRunning amok is a ludicrous phrase here. Yes, it would be a wanton denial of association. A wild, blood bath of refusal of trade. And that crazed lunatic would still face the open censure of everyone who thought that mindset was stupid, and the implicit cost of loss of business. It's not like there's a lot of history here, about how people can prosper in hostile majority societies and boycotts can negatively impact bigoted businesses.\n\n&gt;As long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.\n\nNo, even a freed slave in the deep South would have seen a benefit from increased buying power, especially them actually.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Yup.

IOW, point for freedom.\n\n&gt;Well no, in the absence of anti-discrimination laws they would just \n&gt;drive them out of the country altogether when they got the chance. \n\nWhich interestingly didn't happen in the century between the Civil War and the Civil Rights era. So what is the bright line for when this apocalypse of economic ostracism would occur sans the 60's Civil Rights era? A century wasn't enough.\n\n&gt;What historical counter-examples? Where?\n\nSo you really don't get it? Interesting. *What* would be the Jewish people I've mentioned about 500 times and their startling [at least for you] economic success **prior to anti-discrimination laws** and *where* would be basically worldwide. I mean you had Marx blathering on about \"The Jewish Question\" in the mid 1800's so it's really been a while now.\n\nSince they didn't get driven out of the countries where they lived for so long that, as a community they got wealthy producing bankers, doctors and lawyers, I am wondering where that leaves your theory about what will inevitably happen to minorities living in hostile majorities.\n\n&gt;I'm not sure what I'm missing here. Why did segregation end (or \n&gt;become reduced), in your mind?\n\nYou're missing at least 3 things I see.\n1) Jim Crow laws violated freedom of association\n2) Not even the Deep South produced economic ostracism just segregation.\n3) I have provided a counter-example to your theory that a lack of anti-discrimination laws will result in some type of ostracism driving the minority out of whatever locale.\n\n&gt;This is such a surreal conversation. You're trying to sell me on the \n&gt;wonders of discrimination,\n\nIt's surreal because you are making it surreal by persistent, and I would have thought intentional misunderstanding.\n\nI am trying to sell you on the wonders of freedom by pointing out your fears about what *might* happen if anti-discrimination laws didn't exist are unfounded and historically inaccurate. I mentioned two examples that leapt immediately to mind, the blacks of the deep South and Jews basically everywhere prior to the 1960's. The Jewish people in particular should be recognized by you as a startling counterpoint since as a people they endured such canards as drinking blood and killing Christ while becoming so materially successful they also became the target of conspiracy theories; somehow all managed without the wonderful benefits of your paternalism pretty much worldwide.\n\nIf personal freedom is *nothing* to you, then there's probably little else to discuss.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1cxzw6", "selftext": "&gt; Segregation was a legal position imposed by Jim Crow laws.

Our irreconcilable disagreement seems to like in you persistently misconstruing my position.

You're offering to take away excellent tangible rights I have like healthcare in exchange for increased \"freedom\" that amounts to more leeway to oppress people over who I hold socioeconomic superiority.

Let me ask: in your \n&gt;society, what would prevent the return of segregation? Or is it that \n&gt;increased segregation is acceptable or desirable to you?\n\nI thought it plain enough and not love for segregation. It was that Jim Crow laws, anti-miscegenation laws, etc., infringed the freedom of association of citizens governed by them. IOW, in \"my\" society, they wouldn't exist, whereas they could in yours being a limitation on free association for the purported good of the citizenry.\n\n&gt;But interestingly did happen countless times in eras without legal \n&gt;repercussion for discrimination.\n\nWhen and where?\n\n&gt;So you're just saying their success (or of the survivors at least) \n&gt;justifies the discrimination? Or what?\n\nAgain I thought it plain and nothing like what you took from it. I repeatedly said their success took place despite the ABSENCE of the laws you say are worthwhile. Not only were they not run out of town as you proposed would be a common occurrence, they prospered. In town after town, century after century, across the world. It's called a counter-example to your hypothesis. **What you claim will happen in the absence of laws that weren't passed until the 60's, historically did not happen.** The Jews did fine internationally right up until two governmental entities decided depriving them of the NEGATIVE rights was a good idea. Lack of community with people who hated them never appeared to be particularly hurtful to the Jewish community. They just went ahead and found useful, well paying jobs to learn and excel at. When the governments started messing with their negative rights to property, life and liberty, yeah things got ugly then.\n\n&gt;What counter example?\n\nJudaism for the 501st time.\n\n&gt;...except for all the ones that didn't.\n\nMeaning whom? Just asking to make sure that your answer is relevant to the topic at hand, how economic discrimination as permitted by an absence of 60's era civil rights laws is harmful. I'm sure you aren't thinking of some governmental program of extermination that is completely irrelevant to the topic at hand.\n\n&gt;The tangible differences I see in your society result in it being harder \n&gt;for me to get a job and easier for me to die. I don't like that.\n\nLife as an adult really is harder. Personal responsibility and decision-making is more difficult than delegating your autonomy to a 3rd party for sure. I think most children can attest to that fact.\n\nReally my only answer to this is that, long term, being an adult is more rewarding. Oh and that authoritarian governments inevitably, throughout human history, turn bad and the liberty ceded to the authority for security bites you in the ass and fails to produce either. That's not a particularly new observation, nor is it one that has any observed counter-examples of which I am aware.\n\nThe incipient bankruptcy of the European [not to mention the American] welfare state should be yet another case in point of the long term lack of feasibility of attempting to guarantee a limitless output of whatever, healthcare, retirement cash, etc., from the limited income

No transfer payments. No Fed. Prices would drop for almost everything. Buying power would increase. Since they have the least money, the poor would see the most gain from this.\n\n- Elimination of all inter- and intrastate trade barriers. Drops in health care insurance as markets open up to interstate competition. Drops in energy costs as state mandated energy monopolies go away. Elimination of all national and state monopolies and cartels, again causing a general price decrease.\n\n- The elimination of gov't interference in economy would also eliminate the motive to corrupt officials.

Those with the highest socioeconomic status would enjoy them disproportionately, with marginalized minority groups at their mercy.  (I guess this is the idea?

People stratify right now to avoid that. The *first* thing I would do upon encountering a large group of people who were anti-me would be to get my family and me the hell away from them.\n\nThe people who've hated Jewish people have tended to hate them because among other things they are often hard workers, gravitate to jobs in demand and earn a lot of money even as they're being discriminated against. That's been the case for a looong time before the civil rights movement in the 60's. Jewish folks didn't have religious strictures against lending at interest; their relative freedom of contract led to material success; they tended to become doctors, lawyers and other skilled professional jobs with high earning potential and they did this for a long time before any laws tried to codify anti-discrimination.\n\nI'd prefer bigotry out in the open, to the hidden, de facto racism that you are powerless to stop anyway. At least then we'd have an open debate, rather than a bunch of embittered bigots going right on with their messed up epistemology but hidden beneath a veneer of compliance.

I can tell you for a FACT that if we'd spent 60 years teaching logic as a core curriculum to kids in public school, racism would be a bizarre memory.\n\nThe problem with racism isn't the behavior, it's the mindset that underlies it. You're obsessed with the symptoms of it, when by and large the nastiest symptoms are already outlawed. You can't stab a Jewish person because you hate them; that's morally impermissible in all cases, and illegal for centuries. Refusing to do business just let's them know who their enemies are. How much easier to put a face on bigotry and stigmatize it than if you publicized some fool refusing to serve X group?\n\nAnd yes, just like now in the status quo, the richest can pay for more material benefits.

You move to a town, armed with your anti-discrim. laws, and discover that despite legal prohibitions from refusing you a job, trade, etc., 95% of the town thought you were bad for your love of anti-discrim. laws, excluded you from everything they legally could, and socially ostracized you. Every protected trade was accompanied by \"Here's your change you statist fiend may you fry in egalitarian hell.\" How happy would you be to mutually benefit the townsfolk w/ the trade of the limited time of your life? Like I said, my first move on encountering organized bigotry you fear, with or without the presence of anti-discrimination laws, would be to leave. \n\nSo my point is that the anti-discrimination laws provide no relevant benefit over the proposed change. The point is moot.\n\nReally my objection to your thought here is that anti-discrimination laws through the agency of allowing gov't to deny freedom of association offer at best minor protection from the force of ostracism  a group could deploy against any minority. There's a big cost and a minor benefit, incredibly minor as it wouldn't change my behavior in the least.\n\nMore importantly, you completely dodged the fact that **without** anti-discimination laws, your fears about some community completely freezing out a given group have already proven ahistorical. Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher. I'm not saying to reject AD laws because they don't eliminate all bigotry. I'm saying reject them because they eliminate so little bigotry they aren't worth the cost.\n\n&gt;is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without \n&gt;fear of consequence.\n\nRunning amok is a ludicrous phrase here. Yes, it would be a wanton denial of association. A wild, blood bath of refusal of trade. And that crazed lunatic would still face the open censure of everyone who thought that mindset was stupid, and the implicit cost of loss of business. It's not like there's a lot of history here, about how people can prosper in hostile majority societies and boycotts can negatively impact bigoted businesses.\n\n&gt;As long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.\n\nNo, even a freed slave in the deep South would have seen a benefit from increased buying power, especially them actually.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Yup.

So what is the bright line for when this apocalypse of economic ostracism would occur sans the 60's Civil Rights era? A century wasn't enough.\n\n&gt;What historical counter-examples? Where?\n\nSo you really don't get it? Interesting. *What* would be the Jewish people I've mentioned about 500 times and their startling [at least for you] economic success **prior to anti-discrimination laws** and *where* would be basically worldwide. I mean you had Marx blathering on about \"The Jewish Question\" in the mid 1800's so it's really been a while now.\n\nSince they didn't get driven out of the countries where they lived for so long that, as a community they got wealthy producing bankers, doctors and lawyers, I am wondering where that leaves your theory about what will inevitably happen to minorities living in hostile majorities.\n\n&gt;I'm not sure what I'm missing here. Why did segregation end (or \n&gt;become reduced), in your mind?\n\nYou're missing at least 3 things I see.\n1) Jim Crow laws violated freedom of association\n2) Not even the Deep South produced economic ostracism just segregation.\n3) I have provided a counter-example to your theory that a lack of anti-discrimination laws will result in some type of ostracism driving the minority out of whatever locale.\n\n&gt;This is such a surreal conversation. You're trying to sell me on the \n&gt;wonders of discrimination,\n\nIt's surreal because you are making it surreal by persistent, and I would have thought intentional misunderstanding.\n\nI am trying to sell you on the wonders of freedom by pointing out your fears about what *might* happen if anti-discrimination laws didn't exist are unfounded and historically inaccurate. I mentioned two examples that leapt immediately to mind, the blacks of the deep South and Jews basically everywhere prior to the 1960's. The Jewish people in particular should be recognized by you as a startling counterpoint since as a people they endured such canards as drinking blood and killing Christ while becoming so materially successful they also became the target of conspiracy theories; somehow all managed without the wonderful benefits of your paternalism pretty much worldwide.\n\nIf personal freedom is *nothing* to you, then there's probably little else to discuss.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1cxzw6", "selftext": "&gt; Segregation was a legal position imposed by Jim Crow laws.

It was that Jim Crow laws, anti-miscegenation laws, etc., infringed the freedom of association of citizens governed by them. IOW, in \"my\" society, they wouldn't exist, whereas they could in yours being a limitation on free association for the purported good of the citizenry.\n\n&gt;But interestingly did happen countless times in eras without legal \n&gt;repercussion for discrimination.\n\nWhen and where?\n\n&gt;So you're just saying their success (or of the survivors at least) \n&gt;justifies the discrimination?

Not only were they not run out of town as you proposed would be a common occurrence, they prospered. In town after town, century after century, across the world. It's called a counter-example to your hypothesis. **What you claim will happen in the absence of laws that weren't passed until the 60's, historically did not happen.** The Jews did fine internationally right up until two governmental entities decided depriving them of the NEGATIVE rights was a good idea. Lack of community with people who hated them never appeared to be particularly hurtful to the Jewish community. They just went ahead and found useful, well paying jobs to learn and excel at. When the governments started messing with their negative rights to property, life and liberty, yeah things got ugly then.\n\n&gt;What counter example?\n\nJudaism for the 501st time.\n\n&gt;...except for all the ones that didn't.\n\nMeaning whom? Just asking to make sure that your answer is relevant to the topic at hand, how economic discrimination as permitted by an absence of 60's era civil rights laws is harmful. I'm sure you aren't thinking of some governmental program of extermination that is completely irrelevant to the topic at hand.\n\n&gt;The tangible differences I see in your society result in it being harder \n&gt;for me to get a job and easier for me to die. I don't like that.\n\nLife as an adult really is harder. Personal responsibility and decision-making is more difficult than delegating your autonomy to a 3rd party for sure. I think most children can attest to that fact.\n\nReally my only answer to this is that, long term, being an adult is more rewarding. Oh and that authoritarian governments inevitably, throughout human history, turn bad and the liberty ceded to the authority for security bites you in the ass and fails to produce either. That's not a particularly new observation, nor is it one that has any observed counter-examples of which I am aware.\n\nThe incipient bankruptcy of the European [not to mention the American] welfare

No transfer payments. No Fed. Prices would drop for almost everything. Buying power would increase. Since they have the least money, the poor would see the most gain from this.\n\n- Elimination of all inter- and intrastate trade barriers. Drops in health care insurance as markets open up to interstate competition. Drops in energy costs as state mandated energy monopolies go away. Elimination of all national and state monopolies and cartels, again causing a general price decrease.\n\n- The elimination of gov't interference in economy would also eliminate the motive to corrupt officials.

Those with the highest socioeconomic status would enjoy them disproportionately, with marginalized minority groups at their mercy.  (I guess this is the idea?

The *first* thing I would do upon encountering a large group of people who were anti-me would be to get my family and me the hell away from them.\n\nThe people who've hated Jewish people have tended to hate them because among other things they are often hard workers, gravitate to jobs in demand and earn a lot of money even as they're being discriminated against. That's been the case for a looong time before the civil rights movement in the 60's. Jewish folks didn't have religious strictures against lending at interest; their relative freedom of contract led to material success; they tended to become doctors, lawyers and other skilled professional jobs with high earning potential and they did this for a long time before any laws tried to codify anti-discrimination.\n\nI'd prefer bigotry out in the open, to the hidden, de facto racism that you are powerless to stop anyway.

You can't stab a Jewish person because you hate them; that's morally impermissible in all cases, and illegal for centuries. Refusing to do business just let's them know who their enemies are. How much easier to put a face on bigotry and stigmatize it than if you publicized some fool refusing to serve X group?\n\nAnd yes, just like now in the status quo, the richest can pay for more material benefits.

Every protected trade was accompanied by \"Here's your change you statist fiend may you fry in egalitarian hell.\" How happy would you be to mutually benefit the townsfolk w/ the trade of the limited time of your life? Like I said, my first move on encountering organized bigotry you fear, with or without the presence of anti-discrimination laws, would be to leave. \n\nSo my point is that the anti-discrimination laws provide no relevant benefit over the proposed change. The point is moot.\n\nReally my objection to your thought here is that anti-discrimination laws through the agency of allowing gov't to deny freedom of association offer at best minor protection from the force of ostracism  a group could deploy against any minority. There's a big cost and a minor benefit, incredibly minor as it wouldn't change my behavior in the least.\n\nMore importantly, you completely dodged the fact that **without** anti-discimination laws, your fears about some community completely freezing out a given group have already proven ahistorical. Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher. I'm not saying to reject AD laws because they don't eliminate all bigotry. I'm saying reject them because they eliminate so little bigotry they aren't worth the cost.\n\n&gt;is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without \n&gt;fear of consequence.\n\nRunning amok is a ludicrous phrase here. Yes, it would be a wanton denial of association. A wild, blood bath of refusal of trade. And that crazed lunatic would still face the open censure of everyone who thought that mindset was stupid, and the implicit cost of loss of business. It's not like there's a lot of history here, about how people can prosper in hostile majority societies and boycotts can negatively impact bigoted businesses.\n\n&gt;As long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.\n\nNo, even a freed slave in the deep South would have seen a benefit from increased buying power, especially them actually.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Yup.

Also, it's a lot harder to perpetuate racist culture when you can't marginalize and dehumanize and separate the \"other.\"  Joe Racist is probably going to get over his affliction faster if he has to deal with the cognitive dissonance of working alongside an equally capable \"other.\"  It's a lot easier to believe and perpetuate damaging nonsense about other groups when you don't have to ever see them or deal with them.\n\n&gt; 2) Because that's EXACTLY what happened to the Jewish diaspora you keep ignoring.

I mentioned two examples that leapt immediately to mind, the blacks of the deep South and Jews basically everywhere prior to the 1960's. The Jewish people in particular should be recognized by you as a startling counterpoint since as a people they endured such canards as drinking blood and killing Christ while becoming so materially successful they also became the target of conspiracy theories; somehow all managed without the wonderful benefits of your paternalism pretty much worldwide.\n\nIf personal freedom is *nothing* to you, then there's probably little else to discuss.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1cxzw6", "selftext": "&gt; Segregation was a legal position imposed by Jim Crow laws.

It's called a counter-example to your hypothesis. **What you claim will happen in the absence of laws that weren't passed until the 60's, historically did not happen.** The Jews did fine internationally right up until two governmental entities decided depriving them of the NEGATIVE rights was a good idea. Lack of community with people who hated them never appeared to be particularly hurtful to the Jewish community. They just went ahead and found useful, well paying jobs to learn and excel at. When the governments started messing with their negative rights to property, life and liberty, yeah things got ugly then.\n\n&gt;What counter example?\n\nJudaism for the 501st time.\n\n&gt;...except for all the ones that didn't.\n\nMeaning whom? Just asking to make sure that your answer is relevant to the topic at hand, how economic discrimination as permitted by an absence of 60's era civil rights laws is harmful.

I think most children can attest to that fact.\n\nReally my only answer to this is that, long term, being an adult is more rewarding. Oh and that authoritarian governments inevitably, throughout human history, turn bad and the liberty ceded to the authority for security bites you in the ass and fails to produce either. That's not a particularly new observation, nor is it one that has any observed counter-examples of which I am aware.\n\nThe incipient bankruptcy of the European [not to mention the American] welfare

Every protected trade was accompanied by \"Here's your change you statist fiend may you fry in egalitarian hell.\" How happy would you be to mutually benefit the townsfolk w/ the trade of the limited time of your life? Like I said, my first move on encountering organized bigotry you fear, with or without the presence of anti-discrimination laws, would be to leave. \n\nSo my point is that the anti-discrimination laws provide no relevant benefit over the proposed change. The point is moot.\n\nReally my objection to your thought here is that anti-discrimination laws through the agency of allowing gov't to deny freedom of association offer at best minor protection from the force of ostracism  a group could deploy against any minority. There's a big cost and a minor benefit, incredibly minor as it wouldn't change my behavior in the least.\n\nMore importantly, you completely dodged the fact that **without** anti-discimination laws, your fears about some community completely freezing out a given group have already proven ahistorical. Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher. I'm not saying to reject AD laws because they don't eliminate all bigotry. I'm saying reject them because they eliminate so little bigotry they aren't worth the cost.\n\n&gt;is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without \n&gt;fear of consequence.\n\nRunning amok is a ludicrous phrase here. Yes, it would be a wanton denial of association. A wild, blood bath of refusal of trade. And that crazed lunatic would still face the open censure of everyone who thought that mindset was stupid, and the implicit cost of loss of business. It's not like there's a lot of history here, about how people can prosper in hostile majority societies and boycotts can negatively impact bigoted businesses.\n\n&gt;As long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.\n\nNo, even a freed slave in the deep South would have seen a benefit from increased buying power, especially them actually.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Yup.

No transfer payments. No Fed. Prices would drop for almost everything. Buying power would increase. Since they have the least money, the poor would see the most gain from this.\n\n- Elimination of all inter- and intrastate trade barriers. Drops in health care insurance as markets open up to interstate competition. Drops in energy costs as state mandated energy monopolies go away. Elimination of all national and state monopolies and cartels, again causing a general price decrease.\n\n- The elimination of gov't interference in economy would also eliminate the motive to corrupt officials.

Legalization of prostitution, nullification of sodomy laws, public decency laws, etc. Nullification of any law preventing gambling. No more cartel influence over state gambling licensing.\n\n- Gov't itself would shrink massively. All that money would go back into productive segments of the economy; all the money blown on compliance, regulation, administration, enforcement, etc. of interventionism and welfare statism would go away, further contributing to both price drops and national productivity.\n\nThat should be enough of a laundry list.

Those with the highest socioeconomic status would enjoy them disproportionately, with marginalized minority groups at their mercy.  (I guess this is the idea?

People stratify right now to avoid that. The *first* thing I would do upon encountering a large group of people who were anti-me would be to get my family and me the hell away from them.\n\nThe people who've hated Jewish people have tended to hate them because among other things they are often hard workers, gravitate to jobs in demand and earn a lot of money even as they're being discriminated against. That's been the case for a looong time before the civil rights movement in the 60's. Jewish folks didn't have religious strictures against lending at interest; their relative freedom of contract led to material success; they tended to become doctors, lawyers and other skilled professional jobs with high earning potential and they did this for a long time before any laws tried to codify anti-discrimination.\n\nI'd prefer bigotry out in the open, to the hidden, de facto racism that you are powerless to stop anyway. At least then we'd have an open debate, rather than a bunch of embittered bigots going right on with their messed up epistemology but hidden beneath a veneer of compliance. In this tolerant paradise the 60's civil rights laws have created, 60 years later, people still gravitate to like ethnic communities and I still encounter overt, ugly racism, sexism, etc., on a daily basis. I can tell you for a FACT that if we'd spent 60 years teaching logic as a core curriculum to kids in public school, racism would be a bizarre memory.\n\nThe problem with racism isn't the behavior, it's the mindset that underlies it. You're obsessed with the symptoms of it, when by and large the nastiest symptoms are already outlawed. You can't stab a Jewish person because you hate them; that's morally impermissible in all cases, and illegal for centuries. Refusing to do business just let's them know who their enemies are. How much easier to put a face on bigotry and stigmatize it than if you publicized some fool refusing to serve X group?\n\nAnd yes, just like now in the status quo, the richest can pay for more material benefits.

You move to a town, armed with your anti-discrim. laws, and discover that despite legal prohibitions from refusing you a job, trade, etc., 95% of the town thought you were bad for your love of anti-discrim. laws, excluded you from everything they legally could, and socially ostracized you. Every protected trade was accompanied by \"Here's your change you statist fiend may you fry in egalitarian hell.\" How happy would you be to mutually benefit the townsfolk w/ the trade of the limited time of your life? Like I said, my first move on encountering organized bigotry you fear, with or without the presence of anti-discrimination laws, would be to leave. \n\nSo my point is that the anti-discrimination laws provide no relevant benefit over the proposed change. The point is moot.\n\nReally my objection to your thought here is that anti-discrimination laws through the agency of allowing gov't to deny freedom of association offer at best minor protection from the force of ostracism  a group could deploy against any minority. There's a big cost and a minor benefit, incredibly minor as it wouldn't change my behavior in the least.\n\nMore importantly, you completely dodged the fact that **without** anti-discimination laws, your fears about some community completely freezing out a given group have already proven ahistorical. Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher. I'm not saying to reject AD laws because they don't eliminate all bigotry. I'm saying reject them because they eliminate so little bigotry they aren't worth the cost.\n\n&gt;is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without \n&gt;fear of consequence.\n\nRunning amok is a ludicrous phrase here. Yes, it would be a wanton denial of association. A wild, blood bath of refusal of trade. And that crazed lunatic would still face the open censure of everyone who thought that mindset was stupid, and the implicit cost of loss of business. It's not like there's a lot of history here, about how people can prosper in hostile majority societies and boycotts can negatively impact bigoted businesses.\n\n&gt;As long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.\n\nNo, even a freed slave in the deep South would have seen a benefit from increased buying power, especially them actually.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Yup.

IOW, point for freedom.\n\n&gt;Well no, in the absence of anti-discrimination laws they would just \n&gt;drive them out of the country altogether when they got the chance. \n\nWhich interestingly didn't happen in the century between the Civil War and the Civil Rights era. So what is the bright line for when this apocalypse of economic ostracism would occur sans the 60's Civil Rights era? A century wasn't enough.\n\n&gt;What historical counter-examples? Where?\n\nSo you really don't get it? Interesting. *What* would be the Jewish people I've mentioned about 500 times and their startling [at least for you] economic success **prior to anti-discrimination laws** and *where* would be basically worldwide. I mean you had Marx blathering on about \"The Jewish Question\" in the mid 1800's so it's really been a while now.\n\nSince they didn't get driven out of the countries where they lived for so long that, as a community they got wealthy producing bankers, doctors and lawyers, I am wondering where that leaves your theory about what will inevitably happen to minorities living in hostile majorities.\n\n&gt;I'm not sure what I'm missing here. Why did segregation end (or \n&gt;become reduced), in your mind?\n\nYou're missing at least 3 things I see.\n1) Jim Crow laws violated freedom of association\n2) Not even the Deep South produced economic ostracism just segregation.\n3) I have provided a counter-example to your theory that a lack of anti-discrimination laws will result in some type of ostracism driving the minority out of whatever locale.\n\n&gt;This is such a surreal conversation. You're trying to sell me on the \n&gt;wonders of discrimination,\n\nIt's surreal because you are making it surreal by persistent, and I would have thought intentional misunderstanding.\n\nI am trying to sell you on the wonders of freedom by pointing out your fears about what *might* happen if anti-discrimination laws didn't exist are unfounded and historically inaccurate. I mentioned two examples that leapt immediately to mind, the blacks of the deep South and Jews basically everywhere prior to the 1960's. The Jewish people in particular should be recognized by you as a startling counterpoint since as a people they endured such canards as drinking blood and killing Christ while becoming so materially successful they also became the target of conspiracy theories; somehow all managed without the wonderful benefits of your paternalism pretty much worldwide.\n\nIf personal freedom is *nothing* to you, then there's probably little else to discuss.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1cxzw6", "selftext": "&gt; Segregation was a legal position imposed by Jim Crow laws.

You're offering to take away excellent tangible rights I have like healthcare in exchange for increased \"freedom\" that amounts to more leeway to oppress people over who I hold socioeconomic superiority.  There's no benefit.  The tangible differences I see in your society result in it being harder for me to get a job and easier for me to die.

Let me ask: in your \n&gt;society, what would prevent the return of segregation? Or is it that \n&gt;increased segregation is acceptable or desirable to you?\n\nI thought it plain enough and not love for segregation. It was that Jim Crow laws, anti-miscegenation laws, etc., infringed the freedom of association of citizens governed by them. IOW, in \"my\" society, they wouldn't exist, whereas they could in yours being a limitation on free association for the purported good of the citizenry.\n\n&gt;But interestingly did happen countless times in eras without legal \n&gt;repercussion for discrimination.\n\nWhen and where?\n\n&gt;So you're just saying their success (or of the survivors at least) \n&gt;justifies the discrimination? Or what?\n\nAgain I thought it plain and nothing like what you took from it. I repeatedly said their success took place despite the ABSENCE of the laws you say are worthwhile. Not only were they not run out of town as you proposed would be a common occurrence, they prospered. In town after town, century after century, across the world. It's called a counter-example to your hypothesis. **What you claim will happen in the absence of laws that weren't passed until the 60's, historically did not happen.** The Jews did fine internationally right up until two governmental entities decided depriving them of the NEGATIVE rights was a good idea. Lack of community with people who hated them never appeared to be particularly hurtful to the Jewish community. They just went ahead and found useful, well paying jobs to learn and excel at. When the governments started messing with their negative rights to property, life and liberty, yeah things got ugly then.\n\n&gt;What counter example?\n\nJudaism for the 501st time.\n\n&gt;...except for all the ones that didn't.\n\nMeaning whom? Just asking to make sure that your answer is relevant to the topic at hand, how economic discrimination as permitted by an absence of 60's era civil rights laws is harmful. I'm sure you aren't thinking of some governmental program of extermination that is completely irrelevant to the topic at hand.\n\n&gt;The tangible differences I see in your society result in it being harder \n&gt;for me to get a job and easier for me to die. I don't like that.\n\nLife as an adult really is harder. Personal responsibility and decision-making is more difficult than delegating your autonomy to a 3rd party for sure. I think most children can attest to that fact.\n\nReally my only answer to this is that, long term, being an adult is more rewarding. Oh and that authoritarian governments inevitably, throughout human history, turn bad and the liberty ceded to the authority for security bites you in the ass and fails to produce either. That's not a particularly new observation, nor is it one that has any observed counter-examples of which I am aware.\n\nThe incipient bankruptcy of the European [not to mention the American] welfare state should be yet another case in point of the long term lack of feasibility of attempting to guarantee a limitless output of whatever, healthcare, retirement cash, etc., from the limited income

But a secret racist who faces a threat of punishment whenever he tries to be racist in a recognizable way that affects other people is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without fear of consequence.\n\n&gt; Although as I pointed out, an increase in buying power will disproportionately benefit the poor, due to the diminishing marginal utility of cash.\n\nAs long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;So just to be clear: in your ideal society, if a town dislikes Jews, it is \n&gt;within their rights to openly drive all the Jews out of town through \n&gt;socioeconomic pressure. And ideally the Jews would just leave in \n&gt;such a situation.\n\nIt's in their rights to drive them out through every means but denial of economic association now, which is a lot, sufficient to make me want to leave. You move to a town, armed with your anti-discrim. laws, and discover that despite legal prohibitions from refusing you a job, trade, etc., 95% of the town thought you were bad for your love of anti-discrim. laws, excluded you from everything they legally could, and socially ostracized you. Every protected trade was accompanied by \"Here's your change you statist fiend may you fry in egalitarian hell.\" How happy would you be to mutually benefit the townsfolk w/ the trade of the limited time of your life? Like I said, my first move on encountering organized bigotry you fear, with or without the presence of anti-discrimination laws, would be to leave. \n\nSo my point is that the anti-discrimination laws provide no relevant benefit over the proposed change. The point is moot.\n\nReally my objection to your thought here is that anti-discrimination laws through the agency of allowing gov't to deny freedom of association offer at best minor protection from the force of ostracism  a group could deploy against any minority. There's a big cost and a minor benefit, incredibly minor as it wouldn't change my behavior in the least.\n\nMore importantly, you completely dodged the fact that **without** anti-discimination laws, your fears about some community completely freezing out a given group have already proven ahistorical. Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher. I'm not saying to reject AD laws because they don't eliminate all bigotry. I'm saying reject them because they eliminate so little bigotry they aren't worth the cost.\n\n&gt;is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without \n&gt;fear of consequence.\n\nRunning amok is a ludicrous phrase here. Yes, it would be a wanton denial of association. A wild, blood bath of refusal of trade. And that crazed lunatic would still face the open censure of everyone who thought that mindset was stupid, and the implicit cost of loss of business. It's not like there's a lot of history here, about how people can prosper in hostile majority societies and boycotts can negatively impact bigoted businesses.\n\n&gt;As long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.\n\nNo, even a freed slave in the deep South would have seen a benefit from increased buying power, especially them actually.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Yup.

Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher.

Lack of community with people who hated them never appeared to be particularly hurtful to the Jewish community. They just went ahead and found useful, well paying jobs to learn and excel at.

No transfer payments. No Fed. Prices would drop for almost everything. Buying power would increase. Since they have the least money, the poor would see the most gain from this.\n\n- Elimination of all inter- and intrastate trade barriers. Drops in health care insurance as markets open up to interstate competition. Drops in energy costs as state mandated energy monopolies go away. Elimination of all national and state monopolies and cartels, again causing a general price decrease.\n\n- The elimination of gov't interference in economy would also eliminate the motive to corrupt officials.

Those with the highest socioeconomic status would enjoy them disproportionately, with marginalized minority groups at their mercy.  (I guess this is the idea?

The *first* thing I would do upon encountering a large group of people who were anti-me would be to get my family and me the hell away from them.\n\nThe people who've hated Jewish people have tended to hate them because among other things they are often hard workers, gravitate to jobs in demand and earn a lot of money even as they're being discriminated against. That's been the case for a looong time before the civil rights movement in the 60's. Jewish folks didn't have religious strictures against lending at interest; their relative freedom of contract led to material success; they tended to become doctors, lawyers and other skilled professional jobs with high earning potential and they did this for a long time before any laws tried to codify anti-discrimination.\n\nI'd prefer bigotry out in the open, to the hidden, de facto racism that you are powerless to stop anyway.

You can't stab a Jewish person because you hate them; that's morally impermissible in all cases, and illegal for centuries. Refusing to do business just let's them know who their enemies are. How much easier to put a face on bigotry and stigmatize it than if you publicized some fool refusing to serve X group?\n\nAnd yes, just like now in the status quo, the richest can pay for more material benefits.

Every protected trade was accompanied by \"Here's your change you statist fiend may you fry in egalitarian hell.\" How happy would you be to mutually benefit the townsfolk w/ the trade of the limited time of your life? Like I said, my first move on encountering organized bigotry you fear, with or without the presence of anti-discrimination laws, would be to leave. \n\nSo my point is that the anti-discrimination laws provide no relevant benefit over the proposed change. The point is moot.\n\nReally my objection to your thought here is that anti-discrimination laws through the agency of allowing gov't to deny freedom of association offer at best minor protection from the force of ostracism  a group could deploy against any minority. There's a big cost and a minor benefit, incredibly minor as it wouldn't change my behavior in the least.\n\nMore importantly, you completely dodged the fact that **without** anti-discimination laws, your fears about some community completely freezing out a given group have already proven ahistorical. Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher. I'm not saying to reject AD laws because they don't eliminate all bigotry. I'm saying reject them because they eliminate so little bigotry they aren't worth the cost.\n\n&gt;is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without \n&gt;fear of consequence.\n\nRunning amok is a ludicrous phrase here. Yes, it would be a wanton denial of association. A wild, blood bath of refusal of trade. And that crazed lunatic would still face the open censure of everyone who thought that mindset was stupid, and the implicit cost of loss of business. It's not like there's a lot of history here, about how people can prosper in hostile majority societies and boycotts can negatively impact bigoted businesses.\n\n&gt;As long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.\n\nNo, even a freed slave in the deep South would have seen a benefit from increased buying power, especially them actually.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Yup.

Also, it's a lot harder to perpetuate racist culture when you can't marginalize and dehumanize and separate the \"other.\"  Joe Racist is probably going to get over his affliction faster if he has to deal with the cognitive dissonance of working alongside an equally capable \"other.\"  It's a lot easier to believe and perpetuate damaging nonsense about other groups when you don't have to ever see them or deal with them.\n\n&gt; 2) Because that's EXACTLY what happened to the Jewish diaspora you keep ignoring.

It's called a counter-example to your hypothesis. **What you claim will happen in the absence of laws that weren't passed until the 60's, historically did not happen.** The Jews did fine internationally right up until two governmental entities decided depriving them of the NEGATIVE rights was a good idea. Lack of community with people who hated them never appeared to be particularly hurtful to the Jewish community. They just went ahead and found useful, well paying jobs to learn and excel at. When the governments started messing with their negative rights to property, life and liberty, yeah things got ugly then.\n\n&gt;What counter example?\n\nJudaism for the 501st time.\n\n&gt;...except for all the ones that didn't.\n\nMeaning whom? Just asking to make sure that your answer is relevant to the topic at hand, how economic discrimination as permitted by an absence of 60's era civil rights laws is harmful.

I think most children can attest to that fact.\n\nReally my only answer to this is that, long term, being an adult is more rewarding. Oh and that authoritarian governments inevitably, throughout human history, turn bad and the liberty ceded to the authority for security bites you in the ass and fails to produce either. That's not a particularly new observation, nor is it one that has any observed counter-examples of which I am aware.\n\nThe incipient bankruptcy of the European [not to mention the American] welfare
