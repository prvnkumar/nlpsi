If a person making $50k and a person making $500k both pay $10k in mortgage interest, the richer person gets a proportionally larger tax break.\n\nAnyway -- the *premium* isn't a tax, the penalty is a tax, and the penalty is effectively flat. (I'd prefer if it *were* actually flat, though, instead of being proportionally much higher for poor people and waiving it off as irrelevant because they get a subsidy when they purchase insurance. Anyone making that argument leaves themself open to you jumping in and saying \"Aha! So the premiums *are* part of the tax!\")\n\nDon't get me wrong, I completely understand your argument that because the penalty can be avoided by purchasing insurance, the cost of insurance might as well be a tax. I just don't think that's how most people see it, and it's not what most people mean when they describe regressive taxes. Maybe that's your goal though, to make people think about what \"regressive tax\" really means.

Requiring all drivers have liability insurance, I think, is a good thing because it covers a minimal amount of things that do not happen often, and therefore cost can be kept low while coverage can still be effective.\n\nWith health insurance though, there often isn't an option for only catastrophic coverage. Health insurance plans cover everything from terminal illness to walking canes. I, and many others, feel that while I benefit greatly from being able to afford a $20,000 MRI should my doctor think it would help, I do not see the benefit of having a $60 cane from Wal-Mart only cost me $40 because I pay a little more on my premium each month for that discount. I just do not need to discount items I can afford - just like I do not need car insurance that gives me a discount every time I change a tire, change the oil, or fill up my gas. These things I can afford to do, and if I pay monthly to bring their cost down, then over time I am still likely to pay more through my monthly premiums than I would have had I just paid $100 here and there as needed.\n\nI think that if it were possible to restructure healthcare in general, then at that time something like universal insurance would be more appreciated by more people, but as the medical industry and health insurance industry stand right now, it seems impossible to me (based on the numbers I have crunched) for people to get a meaningful use out of their insurance. For instance - the cheapest plans I have seen are still about $200 a month - do you know ANYBODY that spends more than $200 a month on maedical bills right now, or perhaps more importantly - do MOST people you know spend more than that? If not, then they will be losing money once they start paying for insurance. Yes, one person somewhere will get in a car wreck and luckily be covered, but 1,000s of people everywhere will just have a new non-trivial bill to add to their stack each month.\n\nFor the record, I like the ACA. Before the ACA I was forced to use a PPO, now I can be on a high deductible plan which fits my needs much better. Our insurance provider told us they would not have offered the High Deductible plan except that they were required to by the ACA. I have not heard many people talk about this, so I am not sure about its accuracey. But our company has setup a deductible account that we can put pre-tax dollars into (like a 401(k)) that we can then use to pay for medical treatment, or we can opt not to use it to pay for medical treatment and pay out of pocket if we want. That way, when I go to the doctor for a little $100 perscription I just pay that (either out of pocket or out of my deductible account). My insurance does not pay for anything until I have paid at least $2,500 out of my pocket (or out of my deductible account), at which point they pay 100% of all medical bills for the rest of the year. This is wonderful, because I can save to cover my deductible, then be covered no matter what if something I can't afford happens. The premiums are higher, but that's ok, because I am not paying to make walking canes 40% cheaper - I am paying to make unaffordable medical bills effectively free.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cckejv3", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1380827865", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;IMO it is more important first to provide coverage for all then if need be revise the law to make it better over time.\n\nI think that government intervention significantly slows progress.

The vote was a non-binding one about the UN small arms treaty.  The vote list appears to be accurate.  Snopes is good for a lot of things, but on political issues it often leaves out important facts.\n\n&gt;The Senate last month also signaled its aversion, voting 53-46 to oppose the treaty in a nonbinding test vote as part of the budget debate. Eight Democrats joined all 45 Republicans in opposing the treaty.  [Source](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/apr/2/un-passes-international-arms-regulation-treaty/?page=all)\n\nOne concern over the treaty that Snopes failed to address is that it would lead directly to a gun registry which is widely considered to be the first step to confiscation (one such discussion is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1kquq5/registered_gun_owners_why_are_background_checks/cbrprop)).  \n\nUnder the treaty every gun that is sold internationally must be registered and the list maintained.  This would include every gun sold in the US by Glock, Heckler &amp; Koch, Walther, SIG Saur, Benelli, Beretta and many, many more.  This registry would have have to be maintained for a minimum of 10 years and each and every transfer recorded.  The easiest way to enforce such a registry would be to simply require all guns to be registered.  \n\nIf you really want more info on this, head over to /r/gunpolitics.
