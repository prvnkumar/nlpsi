{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Your realizations on the true impact of regulation and taxes are perfectly correct, and have been recognized by economists for decades now (but who listens to them, right?). There are two reasons people like to go over business: such policies can have some small short-term benefits (even though they only hurt everything in the long run), and because people hate thinking that more successful people are better than them, so prefer to think that the rich and very successful of society reached their position unfairly, or by being bad people, or by exploiting others, etc., and so are more than happy to use government power to make things \"fair\" (in their favor, of course).\n\nThis is not to say that regulations were meant to do what they often do in practice. Your example of inspections might seem perfectly reasonable to someone who doesn't think about the unintended consequences of a law. However, what you'll often find is that large businesses will, in fact, lobby for regulation that one might expect them to oppose, because they know it will stop competitors from entering the market due to the costs. \n\nFor example, in France right now, you'll see an interesting phenomenon: there are TONS of firms with 49 employees. This is because in France, the moment a firm hits 50 employees, a crapton of regulations start to apply to them, so rather than expand, hire more people and provide more product for customers, these firms are essentially forced to avoid growth. \n\nMy final point is that the relationship between workers and so-called \"capitalists\" is often misinterpreted as a parasitic one, while it is, in reality, a symbiotic one.

As a libertarian/borderline anarcho-capitalist, I am fully for the right for workers to organize and peacefully strike or bargain with their employers. However, this comes with several caveats. Firstly, the state or a union shouldn't be able to force someone to join a union against their will, since (1) this gives one union a monopoly on labor in an industry, which is always bad, and (2) it limits the individual freedoms of the employee (after all, if I would rather not join a union for whatever reason, why should anyone be able to force me?)\n\nSecondly, while I'm fine with people forming and joining unions, know that if a worker violates their contract with their employer (for example, by striking), the employer has every right to violate their end of the contract (i.e. firing you). \n\nEssentially, people should be free to do what they will, including agreeing (or not) to any contract voluntarily, whether employment or joining a union.

The city of Detroit, for example, has become infamous for using eminent domain for projects that end up failing completely to benefit the city at all.\n\nBottom line is, in a free market, absolutely *nobody* has the power to force you to buy or sell something at a fixed price. You always have the option to look somewhere else, or to just refuse to buy/sell. Why should the government get a special right to coerce you like that?", "id": "t1_cbfh51h", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "haalidoodi", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1jjhix", "selftext": "Then get the government out of those businesses.

People with extra money usually keep it in a bank, right? But that money doesn't just sit in a vault, but is used by banks to provide loans to new and growing businesses, which could not expand (or at least, could only do so very slowly) without them. If you take all that \"idle monies\" and redistribute it to the lower classes, chances are they'll spend it rather than save it, so aggregate demand would go up in an economy, as people are *buying* more of everything. Unfortunately, in the face of increasing demand, firms can't get loans to expand production, since all of the \"idle monies\" has been redistributed and made unavailable to lenders and lendees. So what do businesses do? There is demand for more stuff than they can produce, so they simply raise prices. Now, eventually this *will* allow them to expand, although as all prices rise in an economy, profits shrink and it becomes more difficult to save up enough to expand (not to mention that, unlike saving for something, a loan is an instant cash injection). The result is that, thanks to redistribution, output will grow much *slower* than before, and prices will only rise.\n\nThe economy naturally finds a balance between savings/investment, as determined by interest rates (literally the price of money), and consumption, as defined by the prices of goods. Now, I'm not saying that consumption is bad (after all, life would really suck if we didn't \"consume\" goods like cars, video games, books, homes, etc.), but if you artificially push the market too far towards consumption by redistributing \"idle monies\", then you sacrifice long-term growth for short-term aggregate utility gain. \n\nFinally, remember: if you tax the rich more, then there'll only be a greater incentive for them to move their assets to somewhere where they'll be safe.

They don't deduct from anyone else's account and they don't jam a bunch of $100s into the disk drive of the computer.  It's new money. That is why bank credit increases the money supply and why I said before that loans *create* deposits. \n\nNow at the same time that they add $4000 to your account, the bank also books a $4000 loan in their internal accounting. So they've added a 4k liability (the deposit) and a 4k asset (the loan). Note that the deposit is a liability for the bank -- they may need to give you cash for it later. By adding an offsetting asset and liability the bank's capital (what we might call net worth for an individual) is unchanged, but their total liabilities and total assets have increased. Thus their capital ratio has fallen.  The limit to when banks can't loan any more is determined by capital requirement regulations. Yes, there are also reserve requirements for liquidity, but if the bank is short on reserves it can always borrow (that loan also shows up as a liability for the bank) more from the Fed until the bank hits its capital ratio limit.\n\nI hope that makes more sense.\n\nEdit: Also take a look at [this article](http://pragcap.com/understanding-the-modern-monetary-system-part-4-2/comment-page-1).

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "One thing you have to remember with \"putting money back into the hands that will spend it\" is: money that firms sit on and don't spend is not useless, but is usually kept in a bank. When a bank has more deposits (i.e. when the supply of bank deposits are greater), banks will loan out more money, and at lower rates. This means that more firms will be able to more cheaply take out loans for investment and expanding their businesses (not to mention that consumers, such as those looking to buy homes or other expensive things can also get money cheaper). \n\nHowever, if you take those loanable deposits and you give them to people that will buy consumer goods with them, it will be more difficult, and more expensive, for entrepreneurs to get loans to either create businesses or expand them, discouraging growth. This is not necessarily a bad thing: after all, while investment can expand output in the long run, it is purchasing and consuming goods (e.g. food, video games, books, tv's, etc.) that provides the population with utility/satisfaction/happiness. \n\nEssentially, my main point is that while increasing consumption (with the inevitable trade-off in investment) may increase happiness in the short run as people can buy more stuff, in the long run, it limits investment, which limits economic growth, or the amount of stuff we can make (and buy) in the future. This is of course ignoring all the other issues surrounding the minimum wage, but since I don't want to turn into a downvote magnet, I'll avoid those more controversial issues in this comment.\n\nEDIT: I've cross-posted this question [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1eeutu/xpost_rask_politics_when_we_raise_the_minimum/) to /r/politicaldiscussion.

Nothing about libertarianism allows the average American a better chance at pot legalization, any more than is happening at state levels currently. We have two states that have legal weed without a libertarian fronting the effort. Obviously its too early to see how the federal government will handle it in the long run, but at the moment it happened on a state level without Ron Paul. Why do people expect states to magically pass all these things once the federal government gives them authority to do so? They haven't yet, and so far it doesn't look like much is stopping states from proposing the idea of legalization except for a lack of support. \n\nIf you are a proponent of legalization, I feel like its most rational to request the federal government to make it happen. Too many states in this polarized society will stick to their guns and refuse things that libertarians want to be decided at a state level. Especially things like gay marriage etc, which I think is enough about the rights of citizens that the federal government should be obligated. \n\nI just don't feel like certain things deserve a regional decision in this day and age. Certain things need to be legislated federally because it makes sense for the country as a whole. I don't think districts in some states have the political sophistication necessary to decide on these issues.. or even the right to in many instances. In many cases, I could see states voting completely against their self interest because they are ignorant of the politics. The federal government can protect those states from themselves. (Which I know sounds funny when you look at the arguments for states rights in comparison.. I just think we are connected enough in this day and age to rule out certain regional preferences). \n\nThis is a little rant-y but its just an opinion.

They would still be forced to \"reserve\" those funds, but their new \"half\" would go into a 401k.  Then, their benefits from the program would be half of normal.  Why not give people that option?\n\nMedicare is a little tougher for libertarians to figure out, but I've always wondered why it isn't more of a reimbursement program/catastrophic coverage rather than universal care, like our current HDHP/HSA combinations.  For seniors who need that immediate cash support, there is Medicare.  But let rich seniors bear the burden a bit more themselves if they can.\n\nAs for the rest of the social net, I think its just too pervasive.  We have dozens and dozens of programs on the federal level.  The libertarian in me wants to just do a review, eliminate/combine to reduce overhead/administrative costs and see if they are actually accomplishing their goals.

Again, we are changing nothing on the patient-facing side (including doctor repayments, as that would then impact the patient as the doctors change their habits).  This [Forbe's Article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/aroy/2011/03/04/private-insurer-profits-13-billion-medicare-fraud-48-billion-health-reform-priceless/) pegs the 2010 at $13 billion.  Lets just use that number to estimate what we might get back.  Under the new law, 80% of all revenues must go to treatment, so that means, at most, this $13 billion is all profit.  That's the low side of savings.  On the higher side, lets assume that this $13 billion is a 4% margin (as cited), which means we have another 16% that could be saved, or $52 billion.  That's the high range, assuming the government could run it with absolutely no overhead.  That's something, but really that's not much.\n\nNow, for any increase in quality, we're going to start eating into that savings - either more care, higher quality care, etc - while still maintaining the same reimbursements/preventing impacts that would hit doctors/hospitals/etc and cause a negative impact to the patients.  (Again, if you cut reimbursements, many might leave the profession or do other things to make up for it.  People react to changes, so we're only looking at positive changes).  How much increase can we really have?  Remember, that high-end estimate was assuming we could save the 20% companies now can use for profit and overhead.  That means the limit is a 25% increase in the quality/access to care, at most, before we lose all cost savings.\n\nAnd all of this is assuming you kept *everything else* the same.  Reimbursement rates and reimbursement speed, etc.  How likely to do you think that is?  And when you look at single-payers across the pond (especially UK) you see that we have faster, better care.  Its basically the old saying - fast, cheap, good.  You can pick two.  Single payer falls into that system as well.  Usually it tends to aim for \"cheap and good\" but sometimes can't even manage that.  Hell, our system can't manage \"fast and good\" many times.\n\nIts all about math.

The problem with our system isn't the health*care* but rather the health *insurance* side of it.\n\nI'd go a single-payer route, but make it more akin to catastrophic coverage rather than some all-covering health insurance.  More like an HDHP/HSA combination.\n\nIt'd work like this.  We adopt the rules governing HSAs for qualified medical expenses and make Americans responsible for the first $3k per person.  Those qualified medical expenses would be dollar-for-dollar refundable tax credits to be filed at the end of each year with the current IRS filing system.  For those Americans who could not afford that sort of out-of-pocket expense, Medicare/Medicaid would be reformed to fill that gap, providing assistance to those who qualify.  HSAs would remain as well, allowing people to fund them for future expenses (tax the credit now, save the money for later).\n\nThe goal of this half of the system is to put pricing competition back into play.  If Americans would shop around for routine care or preventative care, we might be able to achieve real savings as doctors/practices begin to compete.  This is how MinuteClinic and those sorts currently make their money - they have NP's instead of doctors who provide low level care for quite a cheap amount.  (As a side note, one of the first things I ask when I get new clients for helping them save/meet financial goals is to ask how much their average doctor visit costs, in total, not just their copay.  They usually don't have a clue.  That's a problem...)\n\nNow, once you hit that cap, the government pays for everything.  Break your leg?  Your out of pocket is only $5k, which you'll get back at tax time (or have Medicare/Medicaid pay for instead).
