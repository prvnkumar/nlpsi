You do have a few Republican members, but not many. In the Senate that wouldn't be a problem, but in the House, you're going to need leadership to let it get to the floor.\n\nAs far as your Congressman is concerned, he's a first-term freshman, so his power is pretty limited. I'm not sure he'd be willing to buck the party leadership, but going to him on it is worth a shot. That said, his support won't sway Boehner/Cantor/company. What you really need to do is get to them. That's going to be a much more coordinated effort. You're talking about phone calls, letters, emails, etc. The best thing you can probably do is spread that link around to \"contact your members of congress\" that they have there in all bold, and get as many people as possible to get in on that. Obviously, those in Boehner's and Cantor's districts would be best, but that's going to be hard to do without real member lists.

Pp. 2\u201353.\n&gt;        (a) The Amendment\u2019s prefatory clause announces a purpose, but does not limit or expand the scope of the second part, the operative clause. The operative clause\u2019s text and history demonstrate that it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms. Pp. 2\u201322.\n&gt;        (b) The prefatory clause comports with the Court\u2019s interpretation of the operative clause. The \u201cmilitia\u201d comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens\u2019 militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule. The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens\u2019 militia would be preserved. Pp. 22\u201328.\n&gt;        (c) The Court\u2019s interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately followed the Second Amendment. Pp. 28\u201330.\n&gt;        (d) The Second Amendment\u2019s drafting history, while of dubious interpretive worth, reveals three state Second Amendment proposals that unequivocally referred to an individual right to bear arms. Pp. 30\u201332.\n&gt;        (e) Interpretation of the Second Amendment by scholars, courts and legislators, from immediately after its ratification through the late 19th century also supports the Court\u2019s conclusion. Pp. 32\u201347.\n&gt;        (f) None of the Court\u2019s precedents forecloses the Court\u2019s interpretation. Neither United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542 , nor Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252 , refutes the individual-rights interpretation. United States v. Miller, 307 U. S. 174 , does not limit the right to keep and bear arms to militia purposes, but rather limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by the militia, i.e., those in common use for lawful purposes.

Originalism s a technique for interpretation, *and I admit that there are other techniques just as valid for doing the same thing*. \n\nMy point is that an originalist will be very well supported regarding the context surrounding the passing of the law. In this case, some of the key points are looking at similar items in state constitutions (the VA one specifically defines the same thing), as well as the discussion of the 2A before it was passed. I think these are particularly relevant when you mentioned that \"intent\" is important here (some believe that original intent is not important, but not me). \n\nA court watcher can point to a guy and say he's an originalist, or he's not, but the method of originalism itself will lead to the same conclusions in this case. None of the dissenting opinions on Heller were originalists, but rather \"living constitution\" guys/gals.\n\nYou seem to be implying (by \"eyes of the beholder\") that there is a lot of conflicting contextual information that has been ignored by the majority on this decision, and that Scalia has selectively picked his sources to support his decision. On the contrary, I've seen no evidence of any other contextual discussion on this topic that conflicts with the majority decision. In light of that, I'm holding that there's really only 1 originalist interpretation here, and that it's well supported.\n\nBut then again, if intent doesn't matter, then it *could* mean anything the court wanted it to. It could mean the right to taxidermied ursus arctos appendages. But then again, it takes an entire court to decide these things, and they decided that it does matter.\n", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "id": "t1_c9ggk0a", "parent_id": "t1_c9gffcf", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431535805, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ce4q9", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9ggk0a", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366139629", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "If you don't see the difference between a mortgage contract and a framework of ideals, then wow.

I think what you're likely to see is an increase in \"challenges from the right\" to any Republicans who agreed to higher taxes, and some of those would lose in what is an increasingly partisan primary electorate. The problem for Republicans right now is that these \"out-flanking\" primary challenges tend to produce more extreme candidates for the general election, which could lead to some losses in the House. I don't see a large shift towards Democrats in the House in the mid-terms, because history shows us the President's party almost always loses in his 2nd-term midterms (it's just the nature of the beast), but their lead could shrink a little more if hyper-partisan nominees made it through in more moderate districts.\n\nGerrymandering has eliminated the threat of this somewhat, at least for the next 10 years. Looking at the states that voted for Obama by pop vote, you can see that many of them have Republican representation at the House and State Legislature levels, Florida being one example. In this way, the parties in power (mostly Republicans right now, but they're hardly the only ones at fault) have ensured that their power will remain. Even a challenge from the right in a hard-right district wouldn't necessarily result in the loss of a seat.\n\nWhat the ramifications are if more partisan Congressmen make it in, Lord only knows.

While I agree with your statement that if there wasn't already an embargo, there wouldn't be one, you then continue to argue for its continued existence.\n\nJust because something could theoretically \"boost\" the current regime isn't a reason to continue the embargo. The bottom line is, keeping it does not hurt Castro in the slightest, only the people who live there. No other country cares anymore, and we deal with much worse regimes on a daily basis. The quickest way to bring any sort of social change is to end the embargo, open borders to travel, and allow more open communication and exchange of ideas.\n\nThere was an interesting poll done by Florida International University in 2011, their \"Cuba Poll\", which showed the vast changes taking place in the Cuban electorate. The biggest takeaway from that poll (which I could have told you from the beginning, being in this demographic and having many Cuban friends growing up) was that younger Cubans don't want to continue the embargo, and really do see it for what it is, a pointless relic from a bygone era. I think it's much like some other social progress, as you see the \"older generations\" pass on, it will fade away.\n\nBefore it was \"just wait for Fidel to die, just wait!\". Now people are realizing it's Raul's turn, then the next one, then the next one. If the Cubans want to \"free themselves\", they will. The thing stunting their economy, and their well-being, more than ANYTHING else, is not the Castros, but us.
