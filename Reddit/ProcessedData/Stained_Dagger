It means no country can compel another country to do what they don't want to do. It's the cornerstone of International Law and has been since the 17th century.\n\nAnything \"trans-national\" like international treaties only have force if all nations agree to participate. Usually when they sign up, the treaty becomes \"law of the land\" and so the rule of law compels the nation to follow it. Any penalties for breaking a treaty must be either purely external (such as nations stop trading/having relations with you) or voluntary from within the violating nation. Treaties can not have non-voluntary internal punishments.\n\n\n\nWhen China has been sued repeatedly for intellectual theft (and I'm not talking about DVD and purses, I'm talking about cars and medicine that they steal the plans to) the Chinese have refused to pay the compensation. Short of a trade embargo there is nothing else that can be done and unfortunately a trade embargo with China are considered more costly than what the recovered fines would be. \n\nWithout an act of war, nations can not *force* a foreign government to act a particular way, they can only isolate them from contact and hope it goes away (see North Korea). Isolating China would cost billions if not trillions and since the Chinese government doesn't seem to care that they are breaking the treaties there's nothing we can do.\n\nEdit: For example, just about every European nation has been brought before an international tribunal of some kind, and they almost always agree to whatever the ruling is even if it costs them money. They could refuse to pay, but that would mean the other European nations could start limiting trade or otherwise denying benefits of other treaties. The Queen of England herself was brought before an EU court for not converting to metric in the businesses she owns and even though no nation could *force* her to pay she paid anyway. Rule of Law and threat of isolation are the only \"power\" these trans-national groups have until we create a new kind of international law (and there's no real proposals of what to switch *to* in that regard). \n\nChina doesn't care about the rule of law like the West does and doesn't fear isolation since that would never happen, there's no big motivation for them to follow everything they sign.

Again, this should be standard.  I'm not for Voter ID without these means to mitigate these issues.\n\n&gt;The difference of course, is that the voter fraud they are trying to prohibit was never a problem in the first place.\n\nCan you provide evidence that people have never tried to vote under someone's name?  It nearly happened to [Eric Holder](http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/04/09/okeefes-video-on-eric-holders-ballot-still-not/185858), although O'Keefe stopped the attempt so he wouldn't actually break the law (since he was filming it).\n\nFurther from that link, it states that voter fraud occurs in 0.00004% of the time.  But while that sounds small, mulitiply that by 100 million and that's 4,000 instances every national election.  The other estimate from Washington was it was 0.0009.  That's 90,000 illegal votes.\n\nSeems to me that if you can manage to get IDs out to those who don't have them - which they need to fully participate in the modern world to begin with - having a control against fraud is a no-brainer.", "id": "t1_capy50m", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "AuditorTux", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1h1ej6", "id": "t1_capymw5", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "cattailboner", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1h1ej6", "selftext": "&gt;I'm saying it's not a systemic problem.

Can we use that for other legal issues - what about financial fraud?  I mean, its only 0.0009%...  Either you put controls in place to prevent fraud or you do not.  As an auditor and CPA, I tend to favor putting controls in place (which is why the TSA drives me nuts because they went the other extreme).\n\n&gt;Is this some make-believe voter ID law you're talking about? In the real world, the voter ID laws do not set up any apparatus to seek out and give IDs to poor people.\n\nMany Voter ID laws give away free, qualifying IDs.  Not sure how much more you can do... but if a law doesn't include that, I'd be opposed to it.\n\n&gt;Anyways, why don't you question the increasing need to provide ID for nearly everything? Your label says libertarian, but in what sense is a requisite citizen ID part of a smaller government?\n\nOne of the key parts of most beliefs is that you don't want to allow someone to harm another, whether libertarian or communist.  If my bank didn't require an ID, someone could walk in and clean out my account.  I'm not just going to rely on the social contract to prevent that.  Now the bank can provide their own issued IDs (some do) or we could consolidate and have the government issue an ID that could take their place.  I'm not one of the crazy anarchists that want to the government to do absolutely nothing.  But what it does do should be done well and efficiently.  This is one of those cases you can make the argument (economies of scale).\n\n&gt;Again, it seems like you are just making shit up as you go. That would be nice, to allow any form of ID on the form count as valid ID (although you should note that one of the forms of ID is a voter registration card, which makes this proposal moot), but most voter ID laws have very narrow definitions of what constitutes valid voter ID.\n\nPick a state's IDs allowed - your choice - and we'll compare it to the I-9's allowable forms of ID.\n\n&gt;Again, I thought we were talking about the actual voter ID laws, not AuditorTux's ideas of perfect voter ID laws.\n\nAnd on your case you're perfect voter ID law is none whatosever.

Anyway, yes, statistically speaking that is acceptable, and I don't think that's a controversial statement in the slightest. And it's one thing to try to completely eradicate cheating, but these laws have other consequences. There are all sorts of articles, feel free to google it, that try to figure out how many legal citizens these laws might prevent from voting. They run the gamut, but I [think this article from ProPublica](http://www.propublica.org/article/everything-youve-ever-wanted-to-know-about-voter-id-laws) is pretty good:\n\n&gt; How many voters might be turned away or dissuaded by the laws, and could they really affect the election?\n\n&gt;It's not clear.\n\n&gt;According to the Brennan Center, about 11 percent of U.S. citizens, or roughly 21 million citizens, don't have government-issued photo ID. This figure doesn't represent all voters likely to vote, just those eligible to vote.\n\n&gt;In late September, an analysis by Reuters and research firm Ipsos of data culled from 20,000 voter interviews found that those lacking proper ID were less likely to vote anyway, \u201cregardless of state law changes.\u201d\n\n&gt;Among those who said they were \u201ccertain to vote,\u201d only 1 percent said they did not have proper ID while another 1 percent said they were uncertain whether they had the proper ID.\n\n&gt;The analysis also found that those who lack valid photo ID tended to be young people, those without college educations, Hispanics and the poor.\n\n&gt;State figures also can be hard to nail down. In Pennsylvania, nearly 760,000 registered voters, or 9.2 percent of the state's 8.2 million voter base, don't own state-issued ID cards, according to an analysis of state records by the Philadelphia Inquirer. State officials, on the other hand, place this number at between 80,000 and 90,000.\n\n&gt;In Indiana and Georgia, states with the earliest versions of photo ID laws, about 1,300 provisional votes were discarded in the 2008 general election, later analysis has revealed.\n\n&gt;As for the potential effect on the election, one analysis by Nate Silver at the New York Times' FiveThirtyEight blog estimates they could decrease voter turnout anywhere between 0.8 and 2.4 percent. It doesn't sound like a very wide margin, but it all depends on the electoral landscape.\n\n&gt;\"We don't know exactly how much these news laws will affect turnout or skew turnout in favor of Republicans,\" said Hasen, author of the recently released The Voting Wars: From Florida 2000 to the Next Election Meltdown. \"But there's no question that in a very close election, they could be enough to make a difference in the outcome.\" \n\nNeedless to say, there really is no consensus, but by whatever measurement, I think at the very least, the net result of these voter ID laws is probably a wash; even the smaller estimates are around that same 90,000 figure you give.\n\n[Here's a segment from Democracy Now!](http://www.democracynow.org/2008/1/10/supreme_court_considers_voter_id_law) from 2008 that says basically the same stuff that I've already said.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1h1ej6", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_caq8h65", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1372206026", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_capymw5", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430687920, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "green", "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_capytcr", "author_flair_text": "[CPA][Libertarian]", "created_utc": "1372180507", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_capy50m", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1430688004, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm saying it's not a systemic problem.

It's not unfounded to say that hate attacks happen, and that organized groups sometimes carry them out. The evidence is, for example, the news story I linked you. Better safe than sorry is exactly the same logic you are using, but reversed. It is better to be safe than sorry when it comes to protecting people from hate attacks vs. it is better to be safe than sorry when it comes to protecting people from civil liberties violations. So if it's silly then you are too. \n\nb. This logic is fine, but completely nonsensical in the context of the US. If the guiding line for the continuation of something is whether or not it can be universal, then there is almost nothing that is allowable in your government. Not every member of the public can be trusted with a firearm, therefore no firearms. Not every member of the public can be trusted with classified intelligence, therefore no classified information. \n\nFurther, if we want to talk about evidence, then provide me a link to even one gun shop or state that does this. And again, and where we're going to most disagree, I think it extremely unwise to make airport travel some sort of right that requires an extreme rationale to override it. \n\n2.\"I think these concerns are not unfounded. This watch list has the **potential** for great abuse...\" Again, let's have some evidence. Yes, the government will abuse people. The difference in my world versus yours is how addressable the concern is. If, in my world, the publication of the list leads to violence, then odds are good that either serious damage or death is the result. In your world, however, someone has to jump through a few extra hoops to get on an airplane. Further, while the IRS and DOJ issues are important, I'm not convinced that some terrible evil has happened. So some Tea Party groups didn't get 501(c)(3) status as quickly as they would've liked. It's not the end of America, and it certainly doesn't result in serious harm to anyone. The best argument you can make is that the delay in status made it more difficult to run their operation and therefore more difficult to advocate for their issues and therefore some generalized harm far in the future hasn't been avoided. That's not a convincing scenario for me.\n\nSo yes, you and I are going to disagree over the \"price\" we'll pay in terms of freedom v. security. We're also going to disagree about the amount of nefarious things that are going on behind the scenes. So unless you can prove this horrible, conspiratorial price to me (and vice-versa dependent on how we view burdens) I'm not going to be persuadable.\n\n3.We have no idea about the success of the list. I think you'll agree that's disquieting, but it's also a mystery rather than something you can hang your \"limited (if any) success\" hat on. Under our form of government the National Counterterrorism Center, authorized by Congress via the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, runs the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE), aka the terrorist watch list. They report to Congress, and so indirectly, are watched by the people. That's the way a republican government works. I think you may have inroads to a good argument for oversight changes, but I don't think your solution of transparency or civilian oversight is the right way to do it. There is absolutely a need to operate in the shadows. You think it's easier to catch a terrorist when they're unsure if they're being tracked, or if they know they are? Further, the publication of information might also tell you something about the source of the information. If I'm an al-Qaeda commander and I know my cell's been identified, and since it is a cell only a limited number of people have access to that information, you think I can't figure out who leaked the information? Bang, there goes the human intelligence source that could prevent future attacks. \n\n4.That's vigilantism plain and simple, which a civil society has no need for. If the government believes that the public can help, rather than, say, attacking random Muslims with the name Mohammed, then they publish the information. Before that point, all you do is start a witch hunt, and give cover to violent nutjobs. Remember, suspected terrorists are on there too. Think of how useful Reddit was with the Boston Marathon bombings. The mob did a bang-up job there.

Or it might make organized hate groups more systematic.\n\nAgain, I think this claim is entirely unfounded.  There is no evidence to support this, and saying \"better safe than sorry\" is silly.\n\nIf we can't trust the public with the list, then maybe we need to remove the list entirely.  Or remove its impact on things like airport security or firearms purchases (which some states use to determine eligibility).\n\n&gt; And even if what you say is true, I'd much rather prefer to be stricter about avoiding violence then liberal in some unfounded concern about civil liberties protections.\n\nI think these concerns are not unfounded.  This watch list has the potential for great abuse, and as we are now seeing with the recent IRS and Media espionage debacles, the Government is hardly trustworthy enough to maintain it.\n\nThis is one of those: trade freedom for security things.  Except, we're not privy to the payout in terms of security.  In fact, we don't even know what this list is all about, who is on it, how one gets on it, etc.\n\nIt's presumably hidden away because its a \"state secret\", but this is easy cover for a whole host of state security apparatuses which can presumably be abused.\n\n&gt; The value in having it around is that it gives airlines, law enforcement agencies, and other groups the ability to flag, track, and investigate potential terrorists. It's record-keeping.

There is no need for it to operate in the shadows.   \n\nLastly, these are suspected terrorists, correct?  Wouldn't it be helpful if people knew who they were so we can all keep an eye out for them?
