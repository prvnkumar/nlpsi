Perhaps if you were only eligible for the top up if you work.. ok. But then this just becomes a tax break for corporations to pay workers fuck all. They'll know that they can cut worker wages and it's ok because the workers will hardly notice the difference and the taxpayer will pick up the tab.\n\nIt's not about always earning more when you're in work, because that's pretty much how it is already. What needs to be true is that you are *way* better off in work, not just a little bit better off. But when you are out of work, the safety net exists that you can still use to live off.\n\nPerhaps if job seekers was means tested to tax recently paid. I've paid tens of thousands of pounds in taxes over the last couple of years. If anyone should be entitled to a buoyant safety net in the event of losing my job, it's me.

The government isn't there to top up wages with taxes paid for by tax on the same wages they are topping up.\n\nIf the minimum wage was brought to a level that an individual could rent a shitty apartment and buy enough food and transport to live off (which would be considerably higher than it is now) then Macdonalds would be forced to pay people more money by law. By extension though, engineers will start commanding more money because what's to stop them walking out of their high stress job into a a fast food joint and earning 80% the wage they used to earn?\n\nAll this extra wage in the hands of Joe public means public spending increases and the opposition noise yelling of companies going bust because they can't afford to pay their employees will be drowned out by the sound of till checkouts ringing off the hook.", "id": "t1_ce34fyj", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "MrPoletski", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_ce32uuo", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428108348, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ce34fyj", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1387214875", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

The social safety net needs to be far enough under the wage you'd get for working for working vs slacking being a no-brainer.\n\nNow if you are offering to top up wages to a minimum level, that means everyone is soluble but still makes you wonder why your working when not working brings you the same money.\n\nIf we lived in a society where even the shittiest job is enough to live off then this could work because the safety net will be considerably lower than the pay of your average job.\n\n\nI really don't see this idea as a solution to anything. What we need is an incentive for companies to pay higher wages. Perhaps we should pass the cost of the additional benefits bill to companies who pay their employees next to nothing. So, for example, the macdonalds worker that works a 50 hour week and still qualifies for food stamps and such, well what if macdonalds were also charged, or taxed for the cost of the food stamps that person still needs.
