The concept of \"fair share\" isn't necessary here. It's \"Are you abiding by the law or are you not?\"  I suppose the closest thing that would equate (to \"wealth redistribution\" and \"fair share\") would be the prohibition of changing your lending practices due to the proximity of jubilee.  The Israelites were instructed, by the law from God, to continue lending money to people that needed it even though the law would shortly tell the lender to forgive the debt.  \n\nAs I mentioned previously, the law was not without its judges, and there are verses detailing how judges handle disputes under the law. \n\nSo while you won't explicitly find a commandment instructing the Israelites to search out those violating the prohibition of changing lending practices right before a jubilee year, you can easily see that they were instructed on how to settle disputes under the law.  \n\nSo if someone wasn't abiding by the law and it was affecting you there were systems put in place to ensure compliance and mete out punishments.\n\nPut simply, a commandment to make sure others are following specific commandments was unnecessary, and is assumed with the creation of systems to settle disputes and dispense justice under the law.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1afuqz", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8xdfei", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1363548297", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "EricWRN", "id": "t1_c8x8606", "parent_id": "t1_c8x5pli", "score": -1, "retrieved_on": 1431613011, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1afuqz", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8x8606", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1363528194", "distinguished": null, "ups": -1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "TeaEarlGreyTepid", "id": "t1_c8x5pli", "parent_id": "t1_c8x5kbg", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431611875, "controversiality": 0, "body": "This portion of the book of Deuteronomy is specifically addressed to the collective theocratic state and its laws.

Of course, he was okay with helping to inflict the USSR with its own Vietnam experience in Afghanistan, sold weapons to Iran illegally, and inflated the military budget to unprecedented levels -- but in terms of actual military operations, it pales against Iraq. \n\nNot to mention, Reagan (and the 1980s GOP) never really tried to end Medicare or Social Security (though Reagan famously opposed Medicare from the start); they didn't try to expand the social safety net, and Reagan demonized welfare recipients, but it was more talk than action. Compare that to Bush's attempt to privatize Social Security, and the Paul Ryan budget's plan to make Medicare a defined-contribution plan rather than a defined-benefit plan. \n\nIn terms of being in cahoots with the religious right, Reagan started a trend, but he definitely didn't see its peak. Reagan's administration cracked down on tax-exempt status for religious organizations in the [*Bob Jones*](http://www.oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1982/1982_81_3) case (decided by Rehnquist, no less!), holding that they cannot racially discriminate in admissions and keep the subsidy.
