It's just that many think right-wing = rich, big business, etc. However, many very wealthy are liberals, e.g. Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, all the major network TV anchors, most hollywood actors, etc\n\nThis statement simply exacerbates the confusion of what left and right really mean in historical terms. Buffet, Gates et al are neo-liberals, not leftists. They're still far to the right of the historical left, but we cannot even have that conversation in the mainstream because the nation has been pushed so far to the right over the last 40 years. You can't talk about labor unions. You can't talk redistributed wealth. You can't talk about anything even remotely leftist in this country without self-marginalization. The propaganda is too strong.\n\nLastly, OP asked for books, not diatribe about why socialist ideals are bad or good.

The reason for that is clear. We have a 1 party ideology in Washington: The business party. They represent and fight for the rights of businessmen and corporations, not the working/labor/poverty class. That's evident in major legislation where average people are losing homes, losing jobs, losing benefits, losing public assistance, earning low wages, and paying for expensive utilities; while corporations and billionaires nearly tanked the economy, drive to privatize everything, destroy the environment, capture regulatory agencies, write their own laws, perpetuate consumerism, buy elections, hate democracy, plunder the earth, and get bailed out and protected for all of it every step of the way.\n\nThere is no middle class. It's either have or have not. And as the gap widens, populations will become more oppressed and eventually will act against the masters. Thus is the cycle of poor and rich.\n\nSo that being said, Democrats don't say far-left outlandish(?) things because it's not in the interest of the masters who own the country. Take healthcare as a prime example.
