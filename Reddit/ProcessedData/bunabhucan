The bit that is important is that none of these countries could move these troops today or in the next few decades without the US allowing it. That is why I mentioned this:\n\n&gt; ...without at least the US remaining neutral...\n\n10,000 troops could go anywhere on earth via commercial air or charter in a matter of days (that is how the US frequently sends them.) Or they could take boats. Hell they could march. But they could not do this if the US made it a priority to prevent it.\n\nI chose that example because it so small and simple yet it clearly shows how far behind the US the rest of the world is in terms of military capacity. We saw PLA troops [*marching*](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/world/asia/02china.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0) into Sichuan after the 2008 earthquake. This is inside their own borders.

Possibly even France or India could pull this off.  While American sea power is currently effectively unchallenged, their air power has limits, especially in the face of advanced air defense systems.  I think that they would lose far too many of their planes and pilots to both dogfighting and air defense systems before they could bring down even a sizable amount of another great power's land forces.\n\nThe fact that we're having the conversation is itself a testament to the large gap in military capabilities, but even American power projection has limits.  I doubt the American capacity to fight a major land war against another great power on the Eurasian landmass because it would present far greater logistical problems than Iraq and Afghanistan combined, and they would have to deal with far higher levels of attrition.\n\nMost importantly, I think that your assessment of \"the next few decades\" is an extremely overoptimistic assessment of American capabilities.  It's impossible to know how military capabilities will match up in even twenty years, and the anti-access and area denial capabilities of the PLAN are already casting doubt on the American ability to project power within the first island chain by the end of the decade.\n\nMaterial power must be backed by both resolve and credibility to be effective, and I think it's questionable whether the U.S. can maintain such resolve and credibility in so many regions and on so many issues, especially when many of those issues are far less salient to them than they are to the relevant actors in their own regions.  This problem is only amplified by their decreasing levels of material power relative to other major actors on the international stage.\n\nIt is certainly possible that no other state may be able to match American military power for several decades, but I really think that they will come close enough to have much greater freedom of movement and action within their own regions within the next one to two decades.  Their military power may not be comparable to the U.S. in the sense that their capacity to launch military operations in the Americas will not even come close to the American ability to launch military operations in their own regional theatres, but I am confident that they will still have the capacity to operate in their own regions at a comparable level to the U.S., at least to the extent that the U.S. would no longer have free reign in its actions in those theatres.", "id": "t1_cd74iqr", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "SENACMEEPHFAIRMA", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1pwk5w", "selftext": "With prior warning, I think the US could stop Russia or China from an invasion with a speed bump worth of US troops and a mutual defense treaty, making that \"unstoppable\" invasion force a war with the US.\n\nI don't question your military analysis in terms of capabilities.

You mentioned the UK, but France has virtually the same military capabilities.  There's also the material power of Germany and Japan, vast potential power from India and Brazil, and an enormous amount of existing power from the PRC and the Russian Federation.  Which of these countries eventually emerge as counters to the U.S., and in what form (U.K. or EU?), I do not know.\n\nMy real issue with your comment is your definition though.  You seem to be taking an extremely \"naval-centric\" view of power.  Just an example of why I disagree wholeheartedly with that view:  if Soviet power had ever extended from the western shores of France to the Korean Peninsula, and from Siberia to the Mediterranean and Southeast Asia, then the country could have been economically and militarily dominant.  Even if they would have been unable to fight in another hemisphere or across an ocean.\n\nThe problem with your definition of unipolarity is that it implies that only great powers like the current U.S. or the former British Empire were \"real\" great powers, and that there is somehow less value in being able to project a million troops a thousand kilometers from your border than there is in being able to send a few hundred thousand troops several thousand kilometers away.  It really depends on the country in question and the geopolitical situation, regardless of how impressive logistically one feat is over another.\n\nThe U.S. is in a unique position since it has no real regional competitors and is isolated from much of the world, so it relies on power projection, but other possible poles of a multipolar system have little to no concern with projecting power in another hemisphere, because most, if not all, of their national interests occur within their own hemisphere, if not their own continent.  The Eurasian landmass is where these countries will be most interested, as well as Africa which is very close by.\n\nAnd honestly, 10 000 troops is not very much, assuming that by \"equipment\" you mean just the troops' equipment, and not tanks or APVs, and you're talking about doing this in just one trip, then I know the PLAN is more or less capable of doing so already.  If we talk about Australia or somewhere else in Oceania, for example, as being that other hemisphere then we can see that, even excluding the PLAN's new aircraft carrier and any future aircraft carriers or amphibious ships, the PLAN's current complement of 3 Type 071 transport docks along with dozens of landing ships (mostly medium or tank and generally capable of carrying 250 fully equipped troops or more depending on variant) could easily ferry 10 000 fully equipped troops in a single trip, and if every amphibious ship was used to its full capacity then they could likely more or less double the 10 000 troop requirement.\n\nI don't know much about other countries' navies, but I doubt that any besides the U.S. and PRC could accomplish this in a single trip as things tand right now, but perhaps the U.K. and France could.  If you're willing to look at more unconventional uses of traditional military hardware (using non-amphibious attack ships for amphibious landings or simple transportation), and allow for multiple trips, then I am confident that we could add some other countries into the mix, probably starting with India or Japan, and maybe including Italy or Spain.  Also, Russia's landing craft and aircraft carrier combined could probably come pretty close to bringing 10 000 troops into southern or central Africa, but they might fall short a couple thousand, I don't really know to be honest.\n\nI really don't think that this is a good gauge of relative material power capabilities, though.

Or they could take boats. Hell they could march. But they could not do this if the US made it a priority to prevent it.\n\nI chose that example because it so small and simple yet it clearly shows how far behind the US the rest of the world is in terms of military capacity.

Possibly even France or India could pull this off.  While American sea power is currently effectively unchallenged, their air power has limits, especially in the face of advanced air defense systems.  I think that they would lose far too many of their planes and pilots to both dogfighting and air defense systems before they could bring down even a sizable amount of another great power's land forces.\n\nThe fact that we're having the conversation is itself a testament to the large gap in military capabilities, but even American power projection has limits.  I doubt the American capacity to fight a major land war against another great power on the Eurasian landmass because it would present far greater logistical problems than Iraq and Afghanistan combined, and they would have to deal with far higher levels of attrition.\n\nMost importantly, I think that your assessment of \"the next few decades\" is an extremely overoptimistic assessment of American capabilities.  It's impossible to know how military capabilities will match up in even twenty years, and the anti-access and area denial capabilities of the PLAN are already casting doubt on the American ability to project power within the first island chain by the end of the decade.\n\nMaterial power must be backed by both resolve and credibility to be effective, and I think it's questionable whether the U.S. can maintain such resolve and credibility in so many regions and on so many issues, especially when many of those issues are far less salient to them than they are to the relevant actors in their own regions.  This problem is only amplified by their decreasing levels of material power relative to other major actors on the international stage.\n\nIt is certainly possible that no other state may be able to match American military power for several decades, but I really think that they will come close enough to have much greater freedom of movement and action within their own regions within the next one to two decades.  Their military power may not be comparable to the U.S. in the sense that their capacity to launch military operations in the Americas will not even come close to the American ability to launch military operations in their own regional theatres, but I am confident that they will still have the capacity to operate in their own regions at a comparable level to the U.S., at least to the extent that the U.S. would no longer have free reign in its actions in those theatres.", "id": "t1_cd74iqr", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "SENACMEEPHFAIRMA", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1pwk5w", "selftext": "With prior warning, I think the US could stop Russia or China from an invasion with a speed bump worth of US troops and a mutual defense treaty, making that \"unstoppable\" invasion force a war with the US.\n\nI don't question your military analysis in terms of capabilities.

So, speculating, Ron Paul might personally be pro-choice but make a political calculation that running with that position would derail something more important that he might consider achievable/important like fed reform or foreign policy.\n\nA better example of this calculus for Ron Paul would be [his position on evolution.](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ron_Paul#On_evolution) I think it is likely that candidate Ron Paul, a physician, personally does \"accept\" the theory of evolution but his political position and calculus is the same as that of candidate Obama on gay-marriage.\n\nSo, OP, Ron Paul being \"inconsistent\" on abortion might just be political calculus - a non core position jettisoned like his evolution position in favor of something more important that he considers achievable.", "id": "t1_cb0ibyn", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "bunabhucan", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1i1o21", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430504792, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cb0ibyn", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1373559359", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

My recommendation for you, a Norwegian trying to understand US gun culture is lurk on /r/guns for a few months, asking polite questions when you don't understand something. \n\n&gt;why haven't the laws changed?\n\nPart of the problem is that the US already has a lot of guns in circulation. If the goal of the US government was to try to aim the gun laws to achieve an outcome like that in Norway or Australia it would have to involve the government taking back some guns (say all handguns for example.) This (\"government is coming or my guns!\") reflexively raises the heckles of large chunks of US society to the extent that such a reform, or even the suggestion of it, is political suicide.\n\n&gt;Why is there such a large support of gun rights in the US?\n\nI would say it's cultural. Norway would be a very different place if there wasn't centuries of continuity and heritage and language. If instead the country had been recently seized from natives, fought a civil war, ended an apartheid-type set of laws and so on, there would be a lot less trust in government. Make the Norwegian government the only world superpower, constantly starting wars and distrust in government would be higher.\n\n&gt;Why do people think more guns is a good answer to increasing crime rates?\n\nThe \"gun debate\" in the US is as unreasonable, vitriolic and fact free as the \"abortion debate.\" Each side has its own set of \"facts\" which it screams at the \"crazies\" on the other side while covering their own ears. Anyone (like you or I) asking questions or trying to understand is frequently shouted down, leaving the only discussion to the fringes.\n\nThe NRA pushed hard for and got a federal funding ban on the CDC (think of them as the \"why do americans die?\" bit of government) funding research into gun violence. The result is a dearth of actual research upon which factual assertions might be made.

At least you put your self in the shoes of the person making that call and realized that the question isn't simple.\n\nThe other thing that I think is a hard mental leap in the first world is grappling with the idea of rule-of-law. There are many jurisdictions and countries where the remit of the government does not extend to all areas notionally governed. So the Pakistani tribal areas, Yemen and the more extreme example of Somalia. If you do the thought experiment that OBL is in a compound in England, you would imagine the US would ask the UK government to handle the arrest. We trust that the UK government is monolithic (does not have rebel factions acting in different directions) and that the UK government can act and impose power *anywhere* inside its territory.\n\nThose assumptions are simply false in Yemen or Pakistan.\n\nSo while you can apply the ideal of preserving national sovereignty (capturing/killing OBL is a \"serious crime\") the fact on the ground is that Yemeni or Pakistani sovereignty is itself an ideal - and an ideal not realized. Whether in the tribal areas where the Islamabad government has no control or in the Abbotabad compound where (presumably) the ISI or a similar faction had carved out a safe haven for OBL, the government is *not* in a position to provide rule-of-law and arrest OBL.\n\nSo given *that* reality, should a country with the power to act (Pakistan would probably not have the power to capture someone in Texas) do so or should it hold back to preserve a utopian ideal of sovereignty and rule of law that does not in fact exist?\n\nIf OBL was hiding out in a failed state like Somalia instead of Pakistan would it change your view on a capture-or-kill operation?

There is a spectrum of military and political options from trying to extradite OBL from Pakistan (he would have fled) to bombing the compound with drones to using B2s to sending in the troops.\n\nThe US has stated that they did not have positive ID on OBL but rather knew it was someone important in AQ and the reasoning was: if not OBL then who? They did consider the B2 bombing option but were worried that the bombing solution required (to destroy tunnels if they existed) would also destroy surrounding houses and possibly not make it easy to ID OBL.

All that said, the decision to capture him alive at all costs or only if he surrenders has to be made before the operation, a question you never answered.\n\nThe US *doesnt* have authority to send soldiers into Pakistan - it's an act of war. Political and military folks (ambassador and a general) were waiting to call their Pakistani counterparts as soon as the US were out of Pakistsni airspace.

At least you put your self in the shoes of the person making that call and realized that the question isn't simple.\n\nThe other thing that I think is a hard mental leap in the first world is grappling with the idea of rule-of-law. There are many jurisdictions and countries where the remit of the government does not extend to all areas notionally governed. So the Pakistani tribal areas, Yemen and the more extreme example of Somalia. If you do the thought experiment that OBL is in a compound in England, you would imagine the US would ask the UK government to handle the arrest. We trust that the UK government is monolithic (does not have rebel factions acting in different directions) and that the UK government can act and impose power *anywhere* inside its territory.\n\nThose assumptions are simply false in Yemen or Pakistan.\n\nSo while you can apply the ideal of preserving national sovereignty (capturing/killing OBL is a \"serious crime\") the fact on the ground is that Yemeni or Pakistani sovereignty is itself an ideal - and an ideal not realized. Whether in the tribal areas where the Islamabad government has no control or in the Abbotabad compound where (presumably) the ISI or a similar faction had carved out a safe haven for OBL, the government is *not* in a position to provide rule-of-law and arrest OBL.\n\nSo given *that* reality, should a country with the power to act (Pakistan would probably not have the power to capture someone in Texas) do so or should it hold back to preserve a utopian ideal of sovereignty and rule of law that does not in fact exist?\n\nIf OBL was hiding out in a failed state like Somalia instead of Pakistan would it change your view on a capture-or-kill operation?

As far as I know, they didn't have any really legitimate claim to Ireland in the first place. Although, the IRA shouldn't have killed innocent people in pursuit of their goals, from their perspective they were acting to expel an illegitimate colonial government, and I have some sympathy with that view.  I say this as an ethnically 'anglo-saxon' settler of a former British colony.\n\nWhat they should do in the case that some of their citizens are killed by members of the IRA is a complicated question. But as far as I can tell, the only way that these cycles of retributive violence can be avoided is through the establishment of systems of legal order through which disputes can be resolved fairly and impartially. In such cases, all actors must relinquish, or be forced to relinquish their claims to the use of illegitimate force. This is the basis of stable social orders within states, and the basis for systems of international law and governance, which though flawed are probably our best bet for avoiding never ending cycles of international violence and their realpolitik justifications.\n\nWishing for an ideal world, as well as acting in concrete ways to bring it about, is in my mind the only real way to address these issues. It reminds me of the Situationist slogan \"be realistic, demand the impossible.\" For what it's worth I don't actually believe that countries should have sovereignty everywhere within their borders. I think some kind of decentralized global federalism would be a better model. How to achieve these goals is somewhat unclear, but at least some attempt to do so would be nice. The US doesn't even try, which essentially blocks the whole thing from ever happening. \n\nWhile it might be true that one must occasionally \"hold ones nose and respond,\" the US does an awful lot of nose-holding. Indeed, given that they are probably the primary proponents of global violence, one gets the impression that they are rather used to the scent of such distasteful acts.\n\nPolitical capital, in my view has nothing to do with this. The notion that Obama must accede to demands for international slaughter in order to press his own domestic program is in no way a justification.

But so far that has not happened, the lower courts \n    have held the political doctrine applicable on the basis of reasons relied on by Judge \n    Wyzanski of the Federal District bench in Massachusetts.\n\n    ...\n\n    The direction in which the foregoing legal factors all point, I believe,\n    is that the courts are not a suitable forum for the settlement of our \n    Vietnam problem.\n\n    Contemplate, for example, the spectacle of the Supreme Court \n    reviewing and pronouncing judgement on the question of whether\n    Congress has authorized our Vietnam operations, with Congress\n    sitting at hardly a stone's throw away able to speak for itself.\n    -- Nuremberg and Vietnam: an American Tragedy pg. 110, 116\n\nAnd you're right, this question led to the passage of the War Powers Resolution ultimately leading to the withdrawal from Vietnam, but if you look at the 2001 AUMF it explicitly says:\n\n    (1) SPECIFIC STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION- Consistent with section 8(a)(1) of the War Powers Resolution, \n    the Congress declares that this section is intended to constitute specific statutory authorization within the \n    meaning of section 5(b) of the War Powers Resolution.", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Stormflux", "id": "t1_c9nol4f", "parent_id": "t1_c9nmudr", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431410716, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1d60e3", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9nol4f", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1367064012", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "reddititis", "id": "t1_c9nmudr", "parent_id": "t1_c9nkyws", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1431411537, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9nmudr", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1367048490", "distinguished": null, "ups": 3}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I also am anti-war.

There is a spectrum of military and political options from trying to extradite OBL from Pakistan (he would have fled) to bombing the compound with drones to using B2s to sending in the troops.\n\nThe US has stated that they did not have positive ID on OBL but rather knew it was someone important in AQ and the reasoning was: if not OBL then who? They did consider the B2 bombing option but were worried that the bombing solution required (to destroy tunnels if they existed) would also destroy surrounding houses and possibly not make it easy to ID OBL.

All that said, the decision to capture him alive at all costs or only if he surrenders has to be made before the operation, a question you never answered.\n\nThe US *doesnt* have authority to send soldiers into Pakistan - it's an act of war. Political and military folks (ambassador and a general) were waiting to call their Pakistani counterparts as soon as the US were out of Pakistsni airspace.

At least you put your self in the shoes of the person making that call and realized that the question isn't simple.\n\nThe other thing that I think is a hard mental leap in the first world is grappling with the idea of rule-of-law. There are many jurisdictions and countries where the remit of the government does not extend to all areas notionally governed. So the Pakistani tribal areas, Yemen and the more extreme example of Somalia. If you do the thought experiment that OBL is in a compound in England, you would imagine the US would ask the UK government to handle the arrest. We trust that the UK government is monolithic (does not have rebel factions acting in different directions) and that the UK government can act and impose power *anywhere* inside its territory.\n\nThose assumptions are simply false in Yemen or Pakistan.\n\nSo while you can apply the ideal of preserving national sovereignty (capturing/killing OBL is a \"serious crime\") the fact on the ground is that Yemeni or Pakistani sovereignty is itself an ideal - and an ideal not realized. Whether in the tribal areas where the Islamabad government has no control or in the Abbotabad compound where (presumably) the ISI or a similar faction had carved out a safe haven for OBL, the government is *not* in a position to provide rule-of-law and arrest OBL.\n\nSo given *that* reality, should a country with the power to act (Pakistan would probably not have the power to capture someone in Texas) do so or should it hold back to preserve a utopian ideal of sovereignty and rule of law that does not in fact exist?\n\nIf OBL was hiding out in a failed state like Somalia instead of Pakistan would it change your view on a capture-or-kill operation? Would it still be an \"act of war\" if the state being \"invaded\" didn't exist in any meaningful way?", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1d60e3", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I was born in Ireland, I think the UK government could have served a warrant in South Armagh or the Bogside with enough planning, though at the risk of British lives.

It is not a fight that can be \"won.\" The other side wants to establish a worldwide caliphate and arewilling to kill to pursue that aim.\n\nI don't know if you see this coming but I'm constructing a slippery slope for you.

Although, the IRA shouldn't have killed innocent people in pursuit of their goals, from their perspective they were acting to expel an illegitimate colonial government, and I have some sympathy with that view.  I say this as an ethnically 'anglo-saxon' settler of a former British colony.\n\nWhat they should do in the case that some of their citizens are killed by members of the IRA is a complicated question. But as far as I can tell, the only way that these cycles of retributive violence can be avoided is through the establishment of systems of legal order through which disputes can be resolved fairly and impartially. In such cases, all actors must relinquish, or be forced to relinquish their claims to the use of illegitimate force. This is the basis of stable social orders within states, and the basis for systems of international law and governance, which though flawed are probably our best bet for avoiding never ending cycles of international violence and their realpolitik justifications.\n\nWishing for an ideal world, as well as acting in concrete ways to bring it about, is in my mind the only real way to address these issues. It reminds me of the Situationist slogan \"be realistic, demand the impossible.\" For what it's worth I don't actually believe that countries should have sovereignty everywhere within their borders. I think some kind of decentralized global federalism would be a better model. How to achieve these goals is somewhat unclear, but at least some attempt to do so would be nice. The US doesn't even try, which essentially blocks the whole thing from ever happening. \n\nWhile it might be true that one must occasionally \"hold ones nose and respond,\" the US does an awful lot of nose-holding. Indeed, given that they are probably the primary proponents of global violence, one gets the impression that they are rather used to the scent of such distasteful acts.\n\nPolitical capital, in my view has nothing to do with this. The notion that Obama must accede to demands for international slaughter in order to press his own domestic program is in no way a justification. I'm sure it played into his decision making, but it is not an argument in favor of violating international law. \n\n\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9nwta8", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1367096837", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "bunabhucan", "id": "t1_c9nw3dj", "parent_id": "t1_c9nv6ms", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431407106, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1d60e3", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9nw3dj", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1367094367", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Shankley", "id": "t1_c9nv6ms", "parent_id": "t1_c9nuv6z", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431407536, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Fair enough, the conditions in Pakistan may make it much more difficult to pursue things like extradition. \n\nIt should be noted that, until very recently the UK did indeed have rebel groups operating within its claimed territory, and was actually forced to relinquish it's claims to some of it's territory.

A no-fly zone *could* sway the outcome of the war, or at least hasten the end of Assad (especially if it expanded to include targeting tanks/guns of the Assad regime.)\n\nThe US is interested in pursuing the fall of Assad because it greatly weakens Iran's hand and diminishes the opportunity that Iran has of becoming a regional hegemon.\n\nThe likely outcomes are Assad to fall within a year or two after much bloodshed, or a quicker outcome if Russia stops blocking intervention.", "id": "t1_c878v8i", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "bunabhucan", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_17navu", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1431146267, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c878v8i", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1359682249", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}

If (say) the upper limit on a gun was a .50 cal machine gun, then *that* would be the pointless patch of mud between the trenches. And if a bolt action .22 with a three round clip was the limit then everybody would be huffing and puffing about how *that* was either the thin line between freedom and tyranny or alternatively was the reason for the first-world-leader-in-gun-deaths spot.\n\nI see this as a culture war.

If you wanted to move the dial to a lower setting to assist your diabolical future plans where do you think the inflection point would be where the government can no longer be kept in line?

This is the level where you would want a rifle that's fast, accurate, and requires minimum fuss, which is why the AK and AR platforms are so popular.\n\nA reduction or limitation that targets commonly available technology never works. Not only is there the disparity of force (criminals already have them and will continue to use them, while you don't/can't), you have the secondary issue of setting arbitrary limits that attempt to restrict, in theory, the infinite potential outcomes of a citizen's genuine need for self-defense/home defense/civil protection.\n\nNext, is the fact that the majority of gun owners are going to gravitate towards a norm. That's the AR-15.  You can spend $500 or $5000.  There are modifications for every component to fit any need, from precision target shooting to hog hunting. The gun is a successful amalgam of close-defense firearms concepts like reliability, modularity, and portability.  Let's say semi-auto rifles were banned.

Because the military won't buy a double-action battle rifle. What trickles down to the citizens for their scaled-down use is a scaled-down version of what is successful on the battlefield. This is no different than NASA's trickledown, or the benefits road cars receive from advanced racing technology.  And, the reason you don't see or hear a cry for weapons beyond a light rifle is because no one wants them for personal defense.  If there is a threat of tanks, then yeah, give me the right to buy a bazooka.  But if the threat is from people, whether looters, robbers, or a crazed, drunk road rager who followed me home, I want a semi-auto pistol and a modular M-4 based carbine.  Sure, if I have to worry about insurrectionists or T-Rexes at 500 yards, I would add a .338 or .50 caliber \"sniper\" rifle to my list.  But that's not really something 99% of the gun owners worry about.\n\nThe stalemate is the most baffling thing about this subject.  It exposes the major differences in culture among regions in the US.  While some communities are daily witnesses to deaths where firearms are used, others are awash in guns, but don't have the crime to go with it.  Statistics are all over the place, because both extremes of the spectrum (the infrareds and ultraviolets?) make a lot of noise that's inaccurate and intentionally misleading. The core players like the FBI have stats available online, along with methodologies, which 90% of those joining the argument will never see.  \n\nIf you try to approach the subject objectively, there are a few issues to consider; one is the \"single-purpose\" argument, which states that because guns are only designed to kill, you can't statistically compare them with vehicle or accidental deaths. The problem with this position is that it negates *any* argument. There is value in looking at where we fail; discounting comparisons because \"cars were never meant to kill\" inhibits speculation that could prove beneficial. Guns are used every day, and based on ammunition sales to gun deaths, 99.997% of bullets never touch flesh.  Even if only half of the ammunition purchased each year was fired, we're talking in excess of three billion rounds. *That's how much Americans use their guns.* And the most popular gun in use is the AR-15 platform.  It's as ubiquitous as the Honda Accord (doh! another car comparison).\n\nRegarding the Title II/NFA discussion, there are some that would like to see a loosening of the restrictions for ownership. There's a camp that wants all restrictions removed, but I wouldn't count them as a majority. Whether from regulation or expense, crimes where fully automatic weapons are involved are nil.  Same with truly high-caliber weapons like the .50 cal. No one uses them in crimes.\n\nHere's the thing about the Second Amendment: it was written so the citizens of America would not be restricted in owning arms to enforce the \"We, the People...\" philosophy.  Core to the American way of life is this tenet of personal responsibility for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  I know that many disagree, but wasn't the United States founded on the concept that the government works for its citizens?  The last stand that a citizen can take is to bear arms against its own government. As bizarre as that sounds, it's played a big part in getting where we are, and protecting other rights. Sure, we stumbled on slavery and suffrage, but hey, it's not like we're still questioning those amendments.\n\nIf you read all the amendments, you can see the intention was to be as general as possible (except for that $20 payment thing). There are no mentions of types of press in the First, or specific designs or locations of abodes in the Fourth.  There's no way we would be able to  permanently amend the Second to reflect types of gun usage.\n\nTL/DR: 99.997 percent of guns are used responsibly, and the 2nd Amendment exists so we can keep our government in line.

I just wonder if (say) the NFA act title II firearms had restricted semi-automatic weapons would the \"need for defense\" argument be for  whatever was then the maximum available firepower weapon (say a large caliber bolt action rifle or pump action shotgun) rather than the AR-15. Conversely if the title II had allowed public ownership of everything up to (say) an automatic machine gun up to a certain caliber, would we be having a debate about public ownership of those instead? I'm not suggesting either change, just wondering if the stalemate nature of the current fight over whatever an \"assault rifle\" is would be about a different gun.\n\nDo you know if anyone publicly advocates for *loosening* the restrictions of the title II?

Worried about tyranny - you can join a militia and train with automatic weapons but they must be kept outside the home at the militia training ground etc.\n\nRight now there are a bunch of different groups with different perceived needs all arguing over the current status quo (itself ambiguous) through the prism of a 220 year old clause with weird phraseology.", "id": "t1_c7zgnx2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "bunabhucan", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_16pfmw", "id": "t1_c7zht4k", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "disgustipated", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Sorry if I wasn't clear.
