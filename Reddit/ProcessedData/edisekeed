Since they formed the majority government and took the presidency in 2007, the [Justice and Development Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_and_Development_Party_(Turkey) (AKP) has become increasingly authoritarian. The violent police reaction to demonstrators in the park was just the straw that broke the camel's back. \n\nThe AKP silenced many members of the secular intellegista community (including artists) for \"instulting relgion\", which curtailed freedom of speech in both the media (jailing thousands of journalists) and academic circles. The government also increased the power of the (traditionally pro-Islamic) police while stunting the (tratidionally pro-secular) military through [Balyoz trials](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sledgehammer_(coup_plan)).\n\nThe AKP also increased the scope and assistance to religious education (which was formally banned in Turkey under Ataturk), imposed restrictions on the consumption of alcohol, revoked the permissibility of abortions after the first week of conception, mandated that every theatre, opera house, and university construct a mosque on their premises, and had the words \"Turkish Republic\" stripped from all public buildings. \n\nIn short: Erdogan has worn out his welcome. His party was widely supported in the earlier years, especially as Turkey saw impressive economic growth under the regime. AKP also promoted peace talks with the [Kurdish Workers' Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Workers'_Party) (PKK), a militarist Kurdish separatist group that engaged in violence within the state for many years. But as the AKP gained in power Erdogan became less sensitive to the will of the people and began to act more like a tone-deaf oppressor. People are simply sick and tired of not being listened to, of being walked over, of being ignored. There are political games afoot as well, with [Kemalist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemalism) rivals of Erdogan and the AKP fanning the flames in the hope that his party will crumble, clearing the way for their ascension.

According to your logic, if an oil company spends money trying to influence the government to relax its regulations on CO2 emissions, that is just evidence that the government is too large and should not be involved in regulating CO2. Your rule of thumb (Is the corporation trying to influence the government on this issue?) rules out the possibility of government ever doing any activity which is against the interest of corporations.\n\nReducing the size of government just gives more power to corporations. You apparently believe government is tipping the scale in favor of big business, and you haven't provided any evidence for that assumption. That's ideology. There was a time in our history where we didn't have a government-enforced minimum wage and people worked twelve hours a day. That's history.\n\nSo, there are two problems:\n\n* Your logic prevents the government from ever doing anything to curb the influence of corporations in favor of the public, affording far more power to corporations\n\n* We already tried what you're suggesting and it didn't work", "edited": 1367778798, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1djyyd", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9so4ez", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1367731322", "ups": 13, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c9t55jg", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "pointmanzero", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1djyyd", "selftext": "You are missing the argument I am making.

Pp. 2\u201353.\n&gt;        (a) The Amendment\u2019s prefatory clause announces a purpose, but does not limit or expand the scope of the second part, the operative clause. The operative clause\u2019s text and history demonstrate that it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms. Pp. 2\u201322.\n&gt;        (b) The prefatory clause comports with the Court\u2019s interpretation of the operative clause. The \u201cmilitia\u201d comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens\u2019 militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule. The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens\u2019 militia would be preserved. Pp. 22\u201328.\n&gt;        (c) The Court\u2019s interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately followed the Second Amendment. Pp. 28\u201330.\n&gt;        (d) The Second Amendment\u2019s drafting history, while of dubious interpretive worth, reveals three state Second Amendment proposals that unequivocally referred to an individual right to bear arms. Pp. 30\u201332.\n&gt;        (e) Interpretation of the Second Amendment by scholars, courts and legislators, from immediately after its ratification through the late 19th century also supports the Court\u2019s conclusion. Pp. 32\u201347.\n&gt;        (f) None of the Court\u2019s precedents forecloses the Court\u2019s interpretation. Neither United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542 , nor Presser v. Illinois, 116 U.

I think these are particularly relevant when you mentioned that \"intent\" is important here (some believe that original intent is not important, but not me). \n\nA court watcher can point to a guy and say he's an originalist, or he's not, but the method of originalism itself will lead to the same conclusions in this case. None of the dissenting opinions on Heller were originalists, but rather \"living constitution\" guys/gals.\n\nYou seem to be implying (by \"eyes of the beholder\") that there is a lot of conflicting contextual information that has been ignored by the majority on this decision, and that Scalia has selectively picked his sources to support his decision.

So no laws have been passed saying that you shouldn't have to pay to purchase, use, or keep a firearm. \n\nYou're incorrect, this has been done in the past ([source](http://www.conservapedia.com/Gun_control) (not the best souce, but I don't save current politician quotes from recent articles, but esp. in Chicago this is exactly their stated intent)):\n&gt; After the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1878, most States turned to \"facially neutral\" business or transaction taxes on handgun purchases. However, the intention of these laws was not neutral. An article in Virginia's official university law review called for a \"prohibitive tax...on the privilege\" of selling handguns as a way of disarming \"the son of Ham,\" whose \"cowardly practice of 'toting' guns has been one of the most fruitful sources of crime.... Let a negro board a railroad train with a quart of mean whiskey and a pistol in his grip and the chances are that there will be a murder, or at least a row, before he alights.\"[33] Thus, many Southern States imposed high taxes or banned inexpensive guns so as to price blacks and poor whites out of the gun market. \n\nIt's worth noting that infringements must be on the \"right to keep and bear\" arms. This means ownership, and lawful use, at least (it probably means in public, but hasn't been interpreted yet, however McDonald points that the concealed carry ban of IL is an infringement, so it's probably safe to assume). \n\nThe 2A doesn't say \"the right to purchase a gun shall not be infringed\". \n\nIn light of the IL's laws, they are clearly infringements on both. \n\nFirst, in most jurisdictions there you have to pay a tax to simply own (\"keep\" a gun, via the registration system and $100/3yr fee). This is clearly an infringement on keeping the arm. \n\nSecond, the concealed carry ban was ruled unconstitutional as it's an infringement on \"bearing\" arms.\n\n&gt; the premise of your argument isn't very strong either, why don't u try comparing gun costs to other, more closely related ideas, such as car/motorycle ownership/use.\n\nI don't think comparing costs is required here.

V. Heller, no rights are unlimited.  so you then have to ask yourself, \"well, under what circumstances can rights be abridged by the government?\" i chose the \"controlling state interest\" argument.\n\nyou can't yell \"fire\" in a crowded theater in violation of your 1st amendment rights, due to controlling state interest.\n\nyou have to pay to register or background check yourself and your guns in violation of your 2nd amendment rights in order to to keep them out of the hands of criminals or the mentally unstable, due controlling state interest.\n\nif you could prove some sort of controlling state interest in preventing fraud in the voting system (such as statistically significant numbers or widespread loss in confidence in the institution), then it'd be ok to abridge the right to vote for people without an ID. \n\netc. etc.    ", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;if it's a bad source, then don't use it. if you're admitting its not a good source, i won't bother to read or respond to it. your source isn't very strong, and i don't feel like responding to the pro-gun folk.\n\nI didn't say it was bad, but not the best. There was a great quote I read recently that I was wishing I could link to where the Chicago guys are specifically saying they intend to limit the 2A with the use of taxes. The source cited is not the best in that it isn't what I had in mind. However, it is actually a pretty good source when discussing the Racist implications of gun control laws of the past and present, which addresses the Jim Crow comments directly. In that way, it is an excellent source. I see nothing to dispute it's holding of previous gun control policy intended directly to have the same effect as Jim Crow laws.\n\nAs for fees/etc, the only infringing I see is when it directly relates to the \"keep and bear\" portion of the 2A, which doesn't include the original purchase of the gun.\n\nThat is not to say that I don't see infringement happening. I do, but I just don't see a constitutional basis against it as a tax as I do with the \"keep and bear\" stuff. \n\nDisenfranchisement is not relevant here, just infringement. State interests are relevant here, but only in the sense that it fits within federal authority, as in a tax. SCOTUS has held repeatedly that congress can impose taxes to limit undesirable behavior (probably most recently in the Obamacare decision). If the government can state that gun *sales* (background checks or sale taxes) or *manufacturing* (federal excise tax) are undesirable, there's nothing to stop them from taxing that.\n\nHowever, gun *ownership* is specifically protected against in the 2A. Passing a gun tax where you had to pay per gun (once or yearly) would be thrown out in court in a heartbeat. Stating that you have to have a license to posses a gun (and then a yearly fee on a license) is on extremely shaky ground, and I don't think will hold up in court much longer in the future. This goes way beyond what the court has upheld (requiring a license for concealed carry, as this goes beyond the home), and I know of no decision upholding such.\n\nAs for the mentally ill, it seems this restriction has not been decided by the SCOTUS. Heller, in the long explanation states:\n&gt;Although *we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment*, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or\nlaws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws impos\u00ading conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. [26]\n\nAnd note 26:\n\n&gt;We identify these presumptively lawful regulatory measures only as examples; our list does not purport to be exhaustive.\n\nWhat they are doing is punting on this one, as is required as this was not addressed in the case at hand. They are saying that the existing prohibitions are to be presumed lawful until specifically addressed.\n\nFrom this, I can't completely agree with you that the reason for the existence of these existing restrictions is due to a \"controlling state interest\", and that any other such state interests can be used to justify any other restrictions.\n\nAs to this balance between state interests and a constitutionally guaranteed right, the Heller decision states (including comparisons to the 1A):\n&gt; We know of no other enumerated constitutional right whose core protection has been subjected to a freestanding \u201cinterest-balancing\u201d approach. The very enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government\u2014even the Third Branch of Government\u2014the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth insist\u00ading upon. A constitutional guarantee subject to future judges\u2019 assessments of its usefulness is no constitutional guarantee at all. \n&gt;Constitutional rights are enshrined with the scope they were understood to have when the people adopted them, whether or not future legislatures or (yes) even future judges think that scope too broad. We would not apply an \u201cinterest-balancing\u201d approach to the prohibi\u00adtion of a peaceful neo-Nazi march through Skokie. See National Socialist Party of America v. Skokie, 432 U. S. 43 (1977) (per curiam). The First Amendment contains the freedom-of-speech guarantee that the people ratified, which included exceptions for obscenity, libel, and disclo\u00adsure of state secrets, but not for the expression of ex\u00adtremely unpopular and wrong-headed views. The Second Amendment is no different. Like the First, it is the very product of an interest-balancing by the people\u2014which JUSTICE BREYER would now conduct for them anew. And whatever else it leaves to future evaluation, it surely elevates above all other interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.\n\nSo what he is saying here is that legal restrictions on the 2A right are those that are understood to have existed when the 2A was ratified. When it was ratified, it was subject to this \"state interest\" balance, but only to the extent of the state interest that existed at that time. Redefining the state interest today should not alter the scope of the restrictions placed on the right in the name of such state interests. The restrictions are constant, short of constitutional amendment, in effect.\n\nNow, lets look at these restrictions you mention in light of this.\n\n1. The limit of shouting \"fire\" in a theater still applies, as it was understood to be so restricted at ratification.\n\n2. Registration of arms should not apply, as it was not understood at the time. In fact, arms didn't even have serial numbers at the time, so any concept of registration could not have been imaginable to those who ratified the 2A. As such, a registration requirement is an infringement.\n\n3. Background checks on sales. Infringement or not doesn't matter. Fed's have been granted the power to regulate interstate commerce, and states their own commerce. Requiring a fee for this is a tax, and also a granted power. [**NOTE:** However, that the Federal gov doesn't have jurisdiction to force background checks for sales that don't cross state lines or involve federally licensed parties. A state does. This matters as to the implementation of background checks only, but the power has been granted to one form of government or the other, and is not reserved to individuals]. [**NOTE2:** I'm not sure the commerce clause will apply the same to non-sale transfers, such as inheriting a weapon].\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1ce4q9", "selftext": "ummm... when the constitution was written, Americans had a 4th amendment right to be secure in their property which of course included the constitutionally gauranteed right to own other human beings (african slaves)....\n\nand even when you couldn't own them, SCOTUS said they weren't citizens.\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "And that was the shitty law of the time, and the SCOTUS confirmed that.

While the government was not permitted to restrict people from owning guns (hence, a negative right) there exists a long list of cases that have brought up the individual right under the second amendment. Heller was the first time that SCOTUS (the highest and final interpreter of the Constitution) recognized that individuals do have a right to own guns for self-defense under the second amendment. \n\nWhile it's true other cases relating to the 2A came up prior to Heller, the SCOTUS can only decide the exact issue at hand, and nothing else. Heller was the first time that the individual right was actually put to the question before the court. Heller addresses this specifically when they say:\n&gt;(f) None of the Court\u2019s precedents forecloses the Court\u2019s interpretation. Neither United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, 553, nor Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252, 264\u2013265, refutes the individual-rights interpretation. United States v. Miller, 307 U.

In terms of guns, it is less of an active guarantee by the government and more of a restriction on the government. \n\nI'd be interested to see how these are any different in interpretation of the law. Whether negative or positive or liberty, or whatever, I would like to actually see how the right to vote and the 2A right are not exactly the same thing.\n\nFrom the \"negative\" point of view (as you define it), these rights pre-exist and are not granted by the government. As such, the government can define no priority of them, or even any specific construction of those rights (saying this one was granted here, or that one there, in different ways). The constitution only holds that rights are granted from God. God isn't answering on which is more important.\n\nSince construction of the rights is not within in the law, the only difference between rights is in the restrictions placed on the rights within the constitution. So where are these differences between the 2 rights we're talking about? Where is there SCOTUS decision stating that they are to be treated differently? \n\nI've yet to see anything, but since I don't have all day to research into this subject, I'll leave it open to the possibility, if someone would just post something along those lines.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "joshmmartin", "id": "t1_c9ggzns", "parent_id": "t1_c9gf1em", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431535600, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I definitely understand that SCOTUS is reactive and it takes a case to reach them before they can rule.

Some might label these as *negative rights* but they are generally known as liberties, meaning that you are free to exercise them without the government interfering.

Whereas the government guarantees everyone the right to vote, not everyone is guaranteed the right to own a gun. Nor the right to drive a car. All the Constitution says is that you can own a gun and it can't be taken away by the government, not that the government has to ensure you can own a gun. \n\n&gt; Then I'd ask for a refund if I were you. \"Shall not be infringed\".

We can't blame just a teacher MOST of the time. Although there are some pretty crappy ones. And as for their hours and pay, teacher are practically babysitters and the sad fact is that most kids spend more time awake with a teacher then they do their own parents. \n\n\n&gt;And please, please, please can we stop with this \"living-wage\" BS?

Also, people makeing UNDER $50k a year is over 50% of the population.

And, as you can see, its not that much harder to hit the median.\n\nThat's all well and good, but I would like to know a place that employs full time at minimum wage with a guarantee 40hrs a week. \n\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1a8ab5", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8vtwte", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1363308534", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "AuditorTux", "id": "t1_c8vo7da", "parent_id": "t1_c8vgjb5", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431586086, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "green", "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8vo7da", "author_flair_text": "[CPA][Libertarian]", "created_utc": "1363291717", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Carmanowar", "id": "t1_c8vgjb5", "parent_id": "t1_c8vgdma", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431582401, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Right.

You can be just as deadly with high-magazine handguns as you can with assault weapons, simply because you can carry more of them. If someone wants to own 100 shotguns, that's fine, because even if he/she went on a rampage, there a low number of shotguns which can be carried and used. The best way I heard it said was on Reddit, that own guns is like collecting pokemon: they all have different feels and uses, and you gotta collect 'em all. It sounds silly, but in some sense it is true. Now, I am in favor of stringently enforcing the laws we have concerning guns and closing the loopholes. A background check should be necessary and private individuals should be able to do them. A simple website where you punch in a gun card id: boom.  That's all it would take. If you sell a gun without doing so, you are liable for some percentage of the damages if the person goes on a spree.\n\n\nI think recreational uses of weapons is okay.

The drone warfare issue is separate, though related, but also a mire that I won't address here.\n\nGuantanamo he made several efforts to close, but in fact has no legislative power to redirect where the detainees go, and was blocked from moving them to anywhere he tried.  \n\nThe drug war, he has increased spending.  [Das not cool](http://www.mpp.org/media/press-releases/obama-administration.html)\nBUT \n&gt; The report stresses that more resources need to be spent on addiction treatment and prevention, and that an enforcement-centric \u201cwar on drugs\u201d is unworkable.\n\nThis is pretty damn refreshing.  Might be lip service, but its nice that at least we have some non-nonsense on the front page of our national drug policy, even if the actual spending priorities still reflect a backwards and paternalistic money machine.\n\nThe deficit, he seems to be set on spending as a long-term avenue towards sustainable growth through investment in education, infrastructure, and deescalation of the military.  Entitlement reform is probably the most crucial immediate budget issue, and he has done little but pay lip service to the idea.  Also, not cool, but I happen to agree with investments in infrastructure and education.  The bloated juggernaut of our government clearly needs to be redesigned, I think through crowdsourcing and direct democracy.  That's off topic.\n\nThe bailout, yeah I'm with you there.  I mean, he didn't draft any part of it, or vote on it, but he could have been at least a vocal opponent of it.  And the appalling power grab that happened in the vacuum of the crisis went unaddressed by O to the H B....  C.R.E.A.M.\n\nFast &amp; Furious-- I'm amazed that anyone ever approved this; it sounded like a dumb plot for a movie.  This particular fiasco left everyone near it running at full speed in the opposite direction.  But Obeezy did say that neither he nor Eric Holder authorized it.  And while Holder did end up with his foot firmly in his mouth, Obama never lied about it.  By the way, the DEA did this a total of 5 (FIVE) times.  And failed.  5.  Times.  People would tear Tom Clancy apart if he reused a plot that much.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATF_gunwalking_scandal\n\nAnd that takes us, finally, to Benghazi.  This horse has been beaten for so long, its pretty much just a puddle of glue (I don't know how that works).  But seriously, this story never had legs.  There hasn't been one substantiated allegation in this entire pasty shoutfest, and still no one can point to any evidence that there was deceit, malice, politicking, or even criminal negligence from Bo or Hilary.  All they have done is ask questions with a mean voice, repeatedly.  WHY didn't you tell us who did it, at first!  --We didn't know, we had false intelligence.  Ok, that point got belabored for a few weeks, then dropped because, apparently, it was true.  Now a new angle.  WHY didn't you provide additional security for the embassy.  Well, she never saw the cable.  This apparently is indicative of a dysfunction in the State Department, cause for concern, but hardly an indictment of Obama (that is what we're talking about, right?)  By the end of the recent congressional hearing, the strongest substantiated criticism I saw was \n&gt; Just withhold. Don't say what you don't know for sure until it's finally decided. -McCain\n\nAs in-- you shouldn't have said anything about a video, even though there were riots over it that day, and attacks on 2 other embassies-- [check it out](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactions_to_Innocence_of_Muslims)\n\nSooo although I would recommend checking out the list made by /u/tealcdargoworf and posted by /u/cynoclast at the top of this thread, I can't really get behind most of what you are saying, and, by and large, these criticisms you listed are the most commonly cited by opponents of BHO.

Not to mention that Goldman is only worth about $70 Billion as a company. Trillions of dollars are not changing hands. These are future derivatives that are not evaluated in the way the article is saying. It would be like saying buying stock in Goldman Sachs is making a $70 billion dollar trade (value of company) when the stock only cost about $150.\n\nAnother thing is that people just assume that a bank can easily manipulate a market at any whim. This is simply not true. People seem to forget that while Goldman Sachs may try to buy up the price of corn for example, there are hundreds of other banks, hedge funds, whole sale buyers, etc. buying and selling corn against them. It is an entire world of traders establishing what is the fair (agreed upon) price. \n\nThe only thing banks like goldman sach do is trade off of information that they hear before anyone else. I am not talking about insider trading (which is illegal but does happen). I am talking about goldman sach being the first to hear about an oil pipepline bursting, or the government giving more subsidies to corn farmers. These things influence the price and they are generally the first to get the information, trade off of it, and make a profit.\n\n", "id": "t1_c82tciy", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "edisekeed", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1765v2", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431065710, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c82tciy", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1359047790", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}

Otherwise, what the hell did you work so hard for your whole life if all that money you earned just disappears from you when you die?\n\nSo if you know the money is going to disappear, you would either 1) save less for after you stop working and try to just blow that money now on recreation and nondurable goods, or 2) spend much more recklessly during your retirement. This basically encourages risky spending behavior and leads people to incur debt and live beyond their means, because they have no incentive to build a nest egg. \n\nAnd then when the people who tried to blow all their money during their lifetimes incur debts, they default sometimes. And when enough of them default, the investors financing their debts don't recover their investments. And when that happens you have a crisis similar to the 2008 housing crisis. The government has to spend more money on stimulus packages, support/welfare payments, and bailouts, and they don't have much tax revenue because people are getting paid less because the businesses they work for aren't recovering their investments (see above), so you have less taxable income, and the government wouldn't be making a ton of money off the new estate tax, because you're trying to blow it all during your lifetime.\n\nI am kind of butchering the economic explanation and blending the long and the short run, but this is basically what would happen.\n\n**TL;DR** it would incentivize spending and possibly overspending during ones life, this sets off debt-investment default chains like the housing crisis, and the government's debt goes up and economic indicators of wellbeing (unemployment, inflation) get worse.
