Essay ahead!**\n\nI'm Canadian, so possibly a bit of a different perspective than you were looking for. I don't really trust conspiracy theories. They're usually the marriage of several factors:\n\n1. Distrust of media. All media is biased; that's for sure. However, some people take this too far in assuming that all media is controlled by the government/Illuminati/what have you, and tells blatant lies on a daily basis. I think when it comes to media, you can usually (not always) trust the facts presented in the stories, but take all narrative with a grain of salt. If Fox News says someone was killed in a car crash, they probably did die in a car crash.\n\n2. Distrust of government and government agencies. Politicians, government workers, and anyone up there really are all people. There is some degree of corporate control in my opinion, but they are still people and if you work hard enough you can get into that position (i.e. it's not a secretive society with strict control on membership). Information can be leaked pretty easily by anyone who has access to it and thinks the public deserves to see it, and conspiracies would be incredibly hard to keep under control.\n\n3. Too many \"If X didn't actually happen, why did...?\" questions. Example: \"If the parents of the Sandy Hook's kids are truly grieving, why did they laugh and have to get into character before appearing on TV?\" These usually have simple, boring answers that are much more fitting according to Occam's razor. These questions are not scientific and add very little.\n\n4. Lots and lots of ad hoc fluff. If one little glitch in the Matrix or one little continuity error appears, people develop a vast unproven theory, and begin to bend it around to fit the evidence. Again, Occam's razor.\n\nThis is why, to me, the vast majority of all conspiracy theories are simply untrue. I love discussing them and theorizing them, but at the end of the day, I never see any real validity.\n\nI don't know too much about JFK's death to comment properly. I do understand that several eyewitnesses heard multiple shots, perceived firing from the grassy knoll, and found evidence of multiple shots in his body/the car. To me, although this could suggest an explanation aside from what the majority of the major investigations concluded, it really doesn't amount to much. Almost all of the conspiracy evidence points towards multiple shooters and nothing more.

The debates are around the government-provided benefits that a married couple receives (joint custody, tax breaks, property ownership, etc.). These government benefits were established because it has been widely accepted that stable married couples are a good thing for a society to have. Government benefits are in place to encourage more people to get married, and to stay married.\n\nA legal marriage is really nothing more than a couple signing a contract - all the business with the church is just a party. The government doesn't care about any of it. My wife and I got 'married' about three weeks before our wedding. We walked into the city hall, filled out a few forms, signed a contract, and went on our way. Because we're in Florida, we had to jump through some extra hoops for not going through a Catholic marriage course (don't specifically recall the details) - but I understand that is not common.\n\nMost people that oppose equal marriage rights are coming from a religious viewpoint.

Their owners are making billions off of them, why can't they get a cut of the prize?  And their careers are extremely short (ten years is a good, long career in most sports), so high taxation means that they'll run out of money in the end, except for the superstars that also get endorsements.\n\n... see, its not just the fact that they make lots of money.

For you and I, that is an easy choice.  We must guarantee funding for programs that reward honest effort : Head Start, Job Corps, Infrastructure Rebuilding, etcetera; or be a witness to the madness when Occupy turns violent.

Their owners are making billions off of them, why can't they get a cut of the prize?  And their careers are extremely short (ten years is a good, long career in most sports), so high taxation means that they'll run out of money in the end, except for the superstars that also get endorsements.\n\n... see, its not just the fact that they make lots of money.

My business is very employee-intensive (CPA firm).  Say you put the maximum wage I could draw down before a 100% tax would be... $2 million.\n\nFirst thing I would do is to look at my low-margin or difficult clients and see, if I dropped them, what that would do to my profits.  Now there are people who need a service that aren't getting it.\n\nSay that it gets me to $2.5 million.  Well, that's $500k worth of work being done for free.  Now I need to drop more clients until my profit is at the $2 million mark.  Say I do... but now I have far more employees than I need.  So I'll need to let some of them go until I peg my estimated profit probably around $1.9 million.  Now we have more people unemployed.\n\nLast, if in this year I see that I'm at $1.8 million in profit, I might start shutting down the business for the year.  After all, I don't want to cross that line.  And I bet my wife would love to have me back for some of the year.  Since its my business, there's no impact to me.  But for all those employees who are temporarily laid off, they've just got unemployment insurance to keep themselves happy.  Trust me, I pay them a lot more than they would get for unemployment.\n\nETA:  Its an economic thought problem like any other.

You know its likely if you work today, you'd hit it and only get paid for half the day.  Would you want to work that day?  Now we're into how risk averse you are, but many people might simply forgo income they would get because they don't have the granularity of work to get up to that line without crossing.  It would be offset some by people working over that line (essentially working that shift) because they really didn't mind... perhaps they have a wife at home that drives them bonkers.

If you're in what is in effect a local monopoly, you'd lose that. You might even start struggling to meet that 2 million a year. Your employees might start leaving you too, because rather than shut his business down and fire his employees when he hits the 2 million dollar mark like some complete asshole, your former employee's company might raise wages and benefits for its employees, which might draw away most of your top talent (even after picking up all the people you laid off). His company would then be full of happier people making enough to support themselves, and they'd know that they have a boss willing to compensate them, so they'd work in a better work environment, and at the end of the day, offer higher client satisfaction.\n\nNow you'd have to personally work much harder, and offer better incentives for your employees to attempt to match what your former employee's company is offering if you want to keep your precious 2 million dollar a year cash cow business from collapsing.\n\n2 million dollars is about equal to 40 man years of work for the average person. Its what most people might make in their entire lifetime. I personally would not shed any tears over your plight should such a thing occur as you'd still be extraordinarily rich. That said, I'm not for a maximum wage. High tax rates yes, but not a maximum wage. 75% taxes should get most of the benefit while keeping incentives high for the wealthy. If nothing else going for 75 over 100 should keep us all from drowning in a sea of rich tears.\n\nThis exchange between us, is a great example of why one of the pillars of right wing thinking is so flawed. The right believes that successful people are successful because of their individual actions. This is partly true, but they're also successful because of the presence of opportunities in their environment. The opportunity, the demand is what really governs business. The rich are not job creators, demand is what creates jobs. If you gave up your business, someone else would step in because there is demand. You started it, so you deserve credit, but if you didn't exist, people would still be able to buy CPA services in your area.\n\nIf Walmart up and collapsed tomorrow, Target, Kmart or some other perhaps new corporation would immediately take its place.

Defense against a tyrannical government. This is an extension of the right to liberty. I doubt this will happen in my lifetime, but this is the primary reason for the 2A. If my right to bear arms is taken away, or even just infringed on (e.g. \"you can only own something with a sporting purpose, like a shotgun or bolt-action rifle\"), it decreases the chance of a successful uprising against a tyrannical government later (even if 'later' means several centuries from now).\n\n2. Personal self-defense (i.e. concealed carry). This is mostly an extension of the right to life. It's actually [safer](http://www.ncpa.org/images/1029.gif) to defend yourself with a gun than to comply with a mugger's demands. \n\n3. Defense of my family (i.e. home defense). This is an extension of the right to life and property. If someone breaks into my house at 3AM, I don't want to be at their mercy. This and the previous point are actually not that rare; there are between 800,000 and 2.5 million defensive gun uses per year in the US.\n\n4. Ideological disagreement with gun control. I can use guns safely, so why should the government take them away from me because other people do not use them safely? I hate the 'nanny state' we're becoming; I should be able to do anything I want as long as it doesn't affect anyone else, and my gun ownership does not affect anyone else. In any case, this is especially important in light of my first reason. Guns represent the power to overthrow a government. A government that does not trust its citizens with that power is dangerous.\n\nNotice that there is nothing about hunting or target shooting in here.

Defense against a tyrannical government. This is an extension of the right to liberty. I doubt this will happen in my lifetime, but this is the primary reason for the 2A. If my right to bear arms is taken away, or even just infringed on (e.g. \"you can only own something with a sporting purpose, like a shotgun or bolt-action rifle\"), it decreases the chance of a successful uprising against a tyrannical government later (even if 'later' means several centuries from now).\n\n2. Personal self-defense (i.e. concealed carry). This is mostly an extension of the right to life.

I hate the 'nanny state' we're becoming; I should be able to do anything I want as long as it doesn't affect anyone else, and my gun ownership does not affect anyone else. In any case, this is especially important in light of my first reason. Guns represent the power to overthrow a government. A government that does not trust its citizens with that power is dangerous.\n\nNotice that there is nothing about hunting or target shooting in here.

Defense against a tyrannical government. This is an extension of the right to liberty. I doubt this will happen in my lifetime, but this is the primary reason for the 2A. If my right to bear arms is taken away, or even just infringed on (e.g. \"you can only own something with a sporting purpose, like a shotgun or bolt-action rifle\"), it decreases the chance of a successful uprising against a tyrannical government later (even if 'later' means several centuries from now).\n\n2. Personal self-defense (i.e. concealed carry). This is mostly an extension of the right to life. It's actually [safer](http://www.ncpa.org/images/1029.gif) to defend yourself with a gun than to comply with a mugger's demands. \n\n3. Defense of my family (i.e. home defense). This is an extension of the right to life and property. If someone breaks into my house at 3AM, I don't want to be at their mercy. This and the previous point are actually not that rare; there are between 800,000 and 2.5 million defensive gun uses per year in the US.\n\n4. Ideological disagreement with gun control. I can use guns safely, so why should the government take them away from me because other people do not use them safely? I hate the 'nanny state' we're becoming; I should be able to do anything I want as long as it doesn't affect anyone else, and my gun ownership does not affect anyone else. In any case, this is especially important in light of my first reason. Guns represent the power to overthrow a government. A government that does not trust its citizens with that power is dangerous.\n\nNotice that there is nothing about hunting or target shooting in here. I enjoy both of those things, but realistically, I could find hobbies to replace them (perhaps even archery).

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_16qi6a", "selftext": "I was going to post a similar question. I'll offer my insight instead.\n\nIt seems to me that back in the 1700s the fresh new 'Murican government was a small organization of people who were afraid (prolly not the right word here) of British rule. The new country was so much more simplistic and didn't take a lot of political time to run it. The government was an organizational tool and a union between people of common beliefs of independence and liberty. The reason the second amendment was put in place was to protect the people from the government if it ever became like a dictatorship or a monarchy.\n\nHowever, on reflection, I don't think the US has ever been in danger of going down that road. The system was set up so that even without the the second amendment the government would never become a force against the people. In other countries this is possible because the government and the people are different groups entirely and there's rarely any flow between the two. For America to attack it's own people would be suicide; the government *is* the people, not a separate culture entirely.\n\nYou're second point is correct as well. What could we the people realistically do against the government? We have some organization, but not nearly as much as the military. We have a few semi-automatics, whereas they have tanks, drones, and big angry machine guns. In the 1700s the government had only guns and cannonry. Things have changed drastically, if gun lobbyists are really afraid of tyranny, they're going to need an amendment granting the right to own tanks and nuclear weapons.\n\nIf you didn't catch it, I'm Canadian. I have no gun and I never intend to buy one. The people who do up here buy them because they like hunting and/or destroying random fruit in slow motion from a distance. We're not paranoid of our government. We know that if a party is unpopular, the opposition will make it difficult for them and they'll quickly be voted out. I don't think any one party has the power to dissolve this kind of democracy.", "id": "t1_c7yi6fz", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sufjanfan", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "You say that there are already enough protections against tyranny, but what happens when the government ignores those protections?

That means there is one civilian AR-15 for every person in the US military, both active and reserves. There are millions of other similar firearms in the US, and in any case, many soldiers would defect to the opposition. In any case, you place too much value on automatic weapons: except for machine gunners, no infantryman will fire his weapon on auto or 3-round-burst. It'll essentially be AR-15 v AR-15, and the US military's preferred tactic is suppression, which requires a constant supply of ammo, especially for the few actual machine guns. Next, you have to think about tactics. Obviously, a citizen with a hunting rifle won't be effective against a tank. So why attack the tank with your hunting rifle? Why not hide, and then snipe the crew when they get out? Why not raid the supply convoys and limit the tank's fuel supply? In any case, a revolution would involve taking DC, and a bunch of civilians with guns would do well there (and tanks and drones wouldn't). In any case, even if the military killed 500 people with tanks and drones, they'd be creating 1000 more opponents; if they used nukes, they'd create millions of opponents.

The most deadly school shootings in US history were done with pistols. In fact, rifles only account for about 400 deaths per year (for reference, hammers are used more often to murder people than rifles). An AWB or magazine capacity restriction would not have prevented any of the recent tragedies (in fact, the Aurora shooting would've been much worse if Holmes used 10-round magazines instead of the 100-round magazine; the 100-round mags are unreliable and his, predictably, jammed).

Defense against a tyrannical government. This is an extension of the right to liberty. I doubt this will happen in my lifetime, but this is the primary reason for the 2A. If my right to bear arms is taken away, or even just infringed on (e.g. \"you can only own something with a sporting purpose, like a shotgun or bolt-action rifle\"), it decreases the chance of a successful uprising against a tyrannical government later (even if 'later' means several centuries from now).\n\n2. Personal self-defense (i.e. concealed carry). This is mostly an extension of the right to life. It's actually [safer](http://www.ncpa.org/images/1029.gif) to defend yourself with a gun than to comply with a mugger's demands. \n\n3. Defense of my family (i.e. home defense). This is an extension of the right to life and property. If someone breaks into my house at 3AM, I don't want to be at their mercy. This and the previous point are actually not that rare; there are between 800,000 and 2.5 million defensive gun uses per year in the US.\n\n4. Ideological disagreement with gun control. I can use guns safely, so why should the government take them away from me because other people do not use them safely? I hate the 'nanny state' we're becoming; I should be able to do anything I want as long as it doesn't affect anyone else, and my gun ownership does not affect anyone else. In any case, this is especially important in light of my first reason. Guns represent the power to overthrow a government. A government that does not trust its citizens with that power is dangerous.\n\nNotice that there is nothing about hunting or target shooting in here. I enjoy both of those things, but realistically, I could find hobbies to replace them (perhaps even archery).

I'll tell my buddies in Afghanistan that they can come home, since they're obviously irrelevant to the war right now. All joking aside, infantry are a necessary part of combat because only they can hold ground. Infantry is the ideal counter to other infantry, so you still need small arms.\n\n&gt;the idea of random people \"sniping\" professional soldiers with small arms, raiding supply lines... Yeah, that worked so well in Iraq where these guys were far better armed.\n\n48,000 dead/wounded Americans? I'd say the Iraqis did pretty fucking well, all things considered. In any case, you're assuming that the US military would overwhelmingly turn against US civilians. That's not true at all. \n\n&gt;Americans don't even have RPGs and full auto weapons.\n\nRPGs would be ideal, but an IED would often work just as well. As for full-auto weapons, do you know when an average US soldier will fire his M16/M4 in anything other than semi? Never. It's a waste of ammo.\n\n&gt;They wouldn't be able to defend themselves even from army of Zimbabwe, let alone from anything modern.\n\nThat's absolutely ridiculous. If the Zimbabwean army tried to invade the US, they would get fucking slaughtered. First of all, we would be fighting on our home turf. Second, there are hundreds of millions of US gun owners, compared to 30,000 active duty Zimbabwean soldiers. And guess what? There are 1.2 million wartime veterans in Texas alone. I'm guessing they have a lot better training than some conscripts from a third-world backwater. Those facts *alone* would mean that US civilians could take out the Zimbabwean military, and I could go on.\n\n&gt;The only effective weapon you'd have would be IEDs, and they're not covered by 2nd amendment.\n\nYeah, but an IED is pretty much useless if you get shot on your way to plant it.
