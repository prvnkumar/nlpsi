It punished every state that allowed persons below 21 years to purchase and publicly possess [alcoholic beverages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage) by reducing its annual federal highway apportionment by ten percent.\n\n&gt;While this act did not outlaw the consumption of alcoholic beverages by those under 21 years of age, seven states and Washington D.C. extended its provisions into an outright ban. These states are: [Alabama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama), [Idaho](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho), [Indiana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana), [Kansas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas), [North Carolina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina), [Pennsylvania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania), and [Vermont](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont). The minimum drinking age is a state law. However, most states still permit \"underage\" consumption of alcohol in some circumstances. In some states, no restriction on private consumption is made, while in others, consumption is only allowed in specific locations, in the presence of consenting and supervising family members as in the states of [California](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California), [Colorado](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado), [Maryland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland), [Montana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana), [New York](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York), [Texas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas), [West Virginia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia), [Wisconsin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin), and [Wyoming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming). The act also does not seek to criminalize alcohol consumption during religious occasions; (e.g. [communion wines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramental_wine), [Kiddush](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiddush)).\n\n&gt;The United States of America is one of only four [developed countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country) in the world who have a nationwide drinking age of over 18, the other three are [South Korea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea) (19), [Iceland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland) (20), and [Japan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan) (20).\n\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](http://i.imgur.com/PwK1DJC.png) [^(i)](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_\\(obverse\\).svg)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^U.S. ^history ^of ^alcohol ^minimum ^purchase ^age ^by ^state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._history_of_alcohol_minimum_purchase_age_by_state) ^| [^Legal ^drinking ^age](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_drinking_age) ^| [^Amethyst ^Initiative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amethyst_Initiative) ^| [^Alcohol ^laws ^of ^New ^Jersey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_laws_of_New_Jersey) \n\n*^\\/u/TheGreenRecluse ^can ^reply ^with ^'delete'. ^Will ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less.* ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/) ^| [^flag ^a ^glitch](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/autowikibot&amp;subject=Glitched comment report&amp;message=What seems wrong: (optional description goes here\\)%0A%0A---%0A%0AReply no. 37071:%0Ahttp://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1wjrsc/why_isnt_there_a_federalset_of_state_laws_that/cf2z4vq)", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cf2z520", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1391114047", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1wjrsc", "selftext": "Yes.

The charter systems is meant to bring business ideas, like free competition, into the world of education.  The worst charter schools will fail; the best will remain running.  This is in contrast to the traditional public school system, where (usually) the school remains open regardless of test performance.  \n\nNow, what's interesting is why these schools fail and if this kind of failure can be avoided.  Theoretically, some charters will fail because they experiment with untested methods--maybe a new curriculum, a certain type of faculty, etc.  This is the kind of failure we want, because it is the only way to really see how new methods of instruction can be implemented in other schools.  But are the schools failing because the district is approving more charters than there are students intersted in charters (supply exceeds demand)?  Are they failing because unqualified leaders are opening these schools (barriers to entry are too low)?\n\nFinally, just because charters are failing does not mean that traditional public school are succeeding.  Are we wasting money on unqualified teachers, administrators, or programs in public schools?  Are our public schools being shutdown at a similar rate (see Chicago or DC)?  \n\nA lot of people view these two systems as being in competition with each other.  While they might compete for enrollment, academic gains are not zero sum, and this is the end game (one hopes) for both systems.

Step one is to chew away at the idea that we rise and fall as one nation with regards to education. after that, you privatize education. you start small, but ultimately end up with a whole bunch of republican wins such as:\n\n1. you create more capitalist enterprises (private schools)\n2. you limit the amount of money the rich suburban towns have to pay to keep a uniform level of education throughout the country.  Some like the lower taxes, some have more racist undertones.\n3. You create new sources of patronage.\n4. You eliminate government intrusion into people's lives.\n5. You dismantle the teachers unions, which are powerful forces working in opposition to you.\n\nhere's a [bit about this](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/12/tea-party-movement_n_1770452.html):\n\n*In Pennsylvania, the dominant conservative player in the school-choice debate, a cause dear to conservatives, was FreedomWorks, an initiative of former U.S. House Majority Leader Dick Armey and powerful conservative financiers. Gov. Tom Corbett on June 30 signed a law for student tuition grants that are paid for by businesses that, in return, receive state tax credits.\n\nAna Puig, the FreedomWorks state director, said she put 34,000 miles on her car building public support for the grants. She visited tea party groups and anyone else who would listen, while also using conventional lobbying of legislators.\n\nAfter the fall elections, Puig said, FreedomWorks will push to raise the $50 million program cap to $100 million. The long-term goal is traditional tuition vouchers paid directly by state tax money. \"Change happens slowly,\" Puig said. \"We understand the value of incrementalism.\"*\n\n", "id": "t1_cdo5m1v", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Why does anyone care who runs the schools if they improve?

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1qe3vy", "selftext": "&gt; It is not \"selling its services to the general public\" - its actual coverage is the citizens of the city.\n\nyes, to the city of South Fulton, TN, their fire department is a standard issue \"socialist\" public entity.  Everyone pays in, everyone gets services.  To everyone else, including the residents of Obion County, TN, it's a capitalist enterprise of selling fire insurance policies.  You pay them, they provide fire protection services, just like Geico does for car insurance. you don't pay them, you don't get any services.  So they show up to the scene of a fire and watch your house burn down while making sure that it doesn't spread to any policy holder's property.  Now luckily, very few towns/cities/counties shirk its duties to provide for its citizens, so the open market for \"fire insurance\" is almost non-existant. that's why i say that the South Fulton FD is more of a public/private partnership acting in some way like a private enterprise.\n\nmy corollary with regards to the ambulance service was a device to show that it's not a slippery slope argument that you can take what are essentially public goods, like fire/police/ambulance and make them insurance policies for those wealthy enough to afford them.  Step 1 would be privatizing them and getting rid of the municipal control. Step 2 would be arguing that not everyone really needs them and that it's too costly to give it to everyone. step 3. is to turn it into a subscription-based model.\n\nyou see this same sort of idea with charter schools.  People want to untangle the idea of \"public education\" and eliminate the \"public\" part.  Others believe we're a nation, and we rise and fall as one.  So privatizing education represents the same sort of \"shirking of duty\" that Obion County does.     \n\notherwise, if a town finds that its better for them to hire an outside company to fill their ambulance services here in Connecticut, then they should by all means do that.  That's just here in CT tho, because i'm damned sure the idea that ambulance services are a \"public good\" isn't going away any time soon.  \n\nnow, in Tennessee, that's a different story.", "id": "t1_cdcohif", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;That's just here in CT tho, because i'm damned sure the idea that ambulance services are a \"public good\" isn't going away any time soon.\n\n&gt;now, in Tennessee, that's a different story.\n\nSo are you saying that those living in Obion County (but not in the city) shouldn't be allowed to make their own decisions?

People want to untangle the idea of \"public education\" and eliminate the \"public\" part. \n\nCharter schools are not the privatization of education - they are more akin to the ambulance analogy.  A group comes in and says that they can get better results while still costing less than if the school district ran it themselves.  In other cases, they aren't even run by another group, but rather focusing on a few subjects such as math or art (we call these magnet schools).

We're rising and falling as a division of a down defined by the school board on student population and teacher requirements.  Its not like someone living in Dallas can decide to transfer to a school in Richardson.  They are locked into the district in which they live... and many times can't even transfer within that district.  So what happens when that assigned school is failing?  Those living up in CT aren't impacted, nor are those with the resources to pull their kids from that school and put them into a private school.  So what do we do with those kids?  Sacrifice them on the alter of some sort of \"national unity\"?\n\nIt sounds great in high-level lines, but real people are impacted by this.

In this case, a private company has come in and said, even with profit included, it could perform the services cheaper than the government itself could.  They cannot, for example, show up and then charge more to transport someone who called 911.

But if I do, that's what my taxes pay for.  And, on top of that, I pay an alarm company to monitor, above and beyond what the police do.

Everyone pays in, everyone gets services.  To everyone else, including the residents of Obion County, TN, it's a capitalist enterprise of selling fire insurance policies.  You pay them, they provide fire protection services, just like Geico does for car insurance. you don't pay them, you don't get any services.  So they show up to the scene of a fire and watch your house burn down while making sure that it doesn't spread to any policy holder's property.  Now luckily, very few towns/cities/counties shirk its duties to provide for its citizens, so the open market for \"fire insurance\" is almost non-existant. that's why i say that the South Fulton FD is more of a public/private partnership acting in some way like a private enterprise.\n\nmy corollary with regards to the ambulance service was a device to show that it's not a slippery slope argument that you can take what are essentially public goods, like fire/police/ambulance and make them insurance policies for those wealthy enough to afford them.

Step 2 would be arguing that not everyone really needs them and that it's too costly to give it to everyone. step 3. is to turn it into a subscription-based model.\n\nyou see this same sort of idea with charter schools.

Those living up in CT aren't impacted, nor are those with the resources to pull their kids from that school and put them into a private school.  So what do we do with those kids?  Sacrifice them on the alter of some sort of \"national unity\"?\n\nIt sounds great in high-level lines, but real people are impacted by this.

In this case, a private company has come in and said, even with profit included, it could perform the services cheaper than the government itself could.  They cannot, for example, show up and then charge more to transport someone who called 911.

Everyone pays in, everyone gets services.  To everyone else, including the residents of Obion County, TN, it's a capitalist enterprise of selling fire insurance policies.  You pay them, they provide fire protection services, just like Geico does for car insurance. you don't pay them, you don't get any services.  So they show up to the scene of a fire and watch your house burn down while making sure that it doesn't spread to any policy holder's property.  Now luckily, very few towns/cities/counties shirk its duties to provide for its citizens, so the open market for \"fire insurance\" is almost non-existant. that's why i say that the South Fulton FD is more of a public/private partnership acting in some way like a private enterprise.\n\nmy corollary with regards to the ambulance service was a device to show that it's not a slippery slope argument that you can take what are essentially public goods, like fire/police/ambulance and make them insurance policies for those wealthy enough to afford them.

Step 2 would be arguing that not everyone really needs them and that it's too costly to give it to everyone. step 3. is to turn it into a subscription-based model.\n\nyou see this same sort of idea with charter schools.  People want to untangle the idea of \"public education\" and eliminate the \"public\" part.  Others believe we're a nation, and we rise and fall as one.

People want to untangle the idea of \"public education\" and eliminate the \"public\" part. \n\nCharter schools are not the privatization of education - they are more akin to the ambulance analogy.  A group comes in and says that they can get better results while still costing less than if the school district ran it themselves.

We're rising and falling as a division of a down defined by the school board on student population and teacher requirements.  Its not like someone living in Dallas can decide to transfer to a school in Richardson.  They are locked into the district in which they live... and many times can't even transfer within that district.  So what happens when that assigned school is failing?  Those living up in CT aren't impacted, nor are those with the resources to pull their kids from that school and put them into a private school.  So what do we do with those kids?  Sacrifice them on the alter of some sort of \"national unity\"?\n\nIt sounds great in high-level lines, but real people are impacted by this.

From my limited understanding, I believe the ACA only mandates a few requirements that every policy must adhere to. The 9.5% cap referred to above only applies to policies on the exchange. You're not on the exchange. Your insurance co. can work out with your employer any kind of rate structure imaginable, within the few ACA requirements. They could demand your first-born goat each season if they wanted. I can only imagine the rationale for the couple/family disparity, but it's clearly not a function of expected costs.

You perhaps got caught in the uninsured non-family-spouse crack. \n\nIf I were you, I would stink up the place (assuming you're on solid ground there) and demand an adjustment, kind of like congressional staff is getting.

And while there's undoubtedly a relationship between poverty and violent crime, it'd be irresponsible to say that they're correlated, as i have no facts to back that up.  Only 4 states show up on both violent crime AND poverty top 10's. \n\n&gt;southern sociocultural fear of crime\n\nso as it's not empirically true that violent crime is more prevalent in the South, then what you're looking at that underpins the idea of \"more guns and less restrictive public policy\" must be a perception that violent crime is more prevalent in the South. (in fact, you even said so yourself in a couple of different places)  Here in the northeast, we don't have this perception as a whole, and it certainly doesn't underpin high levels of gun ownership and less restrictive public policy.\n\nso then back to the question of \"what does then?\"  The study suggests that latent racism correlates with gun ownership and less restrictive public policy.   \n\nHonestly, i thought this would have been picked apart by now.  there's no even plausible counter-explanation?

This is only my experience so generalize it as much or as little as you like. \n\nWorked at a decent size country club doing HR, short of paying the bills I was the health insurance person. We had about 100 FT employees that were broken into two categories 52 and 30 week, based on if they worked all year or part of the year (country clubs are seasonal around me). We had to have two different rates for each group and it was difficult at best to track their contributions (our payderp company was terrible so this was all done manually through excel) and when they reached their annual contribution and how much longer they had to pay. In addition to that we had 2 plans, and then family or single, and 2 dental options as well, so their contributions were all over the board. FT people were enough of a problem but for the most part this was their career we knew they were coming back to work each season and we knew they would be working an average of 40 hours a week. \n\nPart time was a whole different game. Their work was often much more seasonal (think tennis pros, life guards, and camp counselors) and their hours in greater flux. To have to figure out how long each group would be working, figure out their contribution rates, and make sure they were there long enough to meet their necessary contributions would have been a logistical nightmare, and then everyone complains that their rate is too high or they are paying too long it just gets complicated. PT people came and went a lot more frequently, they would vanish without a word or would reduce their hours to less than 10 per week if they had to. Because they were so varied it would have been a logistical nightmare to try and apply rates for them and then for the ones that only worked a few hours the deductions might total their entire paycheck (for reference a 30 week employee paid ~$60 a week for a family plan) because their deduction would be that much higher. It also is a risk that if they disappear on us we are still on the hook for that months insurance premium, employer's 75% + whatever the employee didn't pay. Since their season and hours is very variable and they often vanish on us they were too much of a risk for us to personally put on the plan, plus to say we were going to now offer insurance to our 200 PT employees would have sent our premiums through the roof. \nThat being said my work was great on if you came there wanting to get insurance or needed it they would work with you (assuming you were a competent worker).

A small contingent of House Republicans (called the Tea Party) have been trying since 2010 to repeal a law called the Affordable Care Act (aka obamacare).  At this point in time their only option to stop it is to not fund it.  So they've intimidated the house into refusing to put forth a bill that contains the money to fund the ACA.  Every time the House puts out a bill that doesn't fund the government in full (including the ACA), the Senate says \"hell no, The HOR passed this legislation, its law, the HOR is going to fund it.  Plus there's proper channels for fixing what you may not like, and holding the government hostage isn't one of them\" and kicks the bill back, and the president says yet again that he won't sign the bill (called a Continuing Resolution, or CR) unless it funds the government fully.  so this goes back and forth a couple times until the day comes that the last CR funding the government expires and there's no new one.  With no money to pay people, the government shuts down.   \n\nTea Party members look like patriots to their constituents for standing up to \"big government\" and blame it on the Senate.  The Tea Party and their supporters believe that the Senate is not compromising by refusing to accept anything other than fully funding the government.     \n\nso where does that leave us now and how can one impact the showdown situation?  if you believe the tea party is wrong, then getting the house to pass a bill fully funding the government is the answer. \n\nBitching at the 30-40 tea party caucus members isn't going to have much effect.  Thanks to gerrymandering, they're not gonna care.\n\nBut there's a 2nd tier of more moderate Republicans who have the tea party plotting for their job.  Some of these more moderate Republicans will vote with the Tea Party to \"look conservative enough\" to discourage lengthy and costly primary battles.

But I'll be consistent and say that Obama is at least just as bad as Bush in saying he has the power to do things unilaterally.  Just off the top of my head, things I think are dangerous expansions of power:\n\n* The war in Libya / saying he didn't need Congressional approval to attack Syria (even though he did go and ask for it) - there are plenty of discussions here related to that issue\n* Drone warfare and all that goes with that.  There is little transparent oversight and [American citizens](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/opinion/the-drone-that-killed-my-grandson.html?_r=0) are being killed.\n* Deciding not to enforce/unilaterally delay laws without the power written into the laws to do this.  Most recently, ]delaying the employer mandate](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-03/does-obama-have-the-power-to-delay-his-mandate-.html).  They say they aren't actually delaying the mandate, but rather the reporting (and therefore enforcement).  Could ambiguity such as this allow future presidents to ignore parts of laws they don't like\n* Obama has claimed that if Congress does not act on immigration, [he will do so on his own](http://thinkprogress.org/immigration/2013/08/13/2459741/rubio-immigration-reform-daca-comparison/).  Remember, if Obama can loosen immigration requirements without Congressional action, the next President could do the opposite just as easily.\n\nAnd I could go on.  What drives me nuts about most of this issues is you will find those who are more than happy to give Obama these powers.  But I have a feeling when the next Republican president gains power, they'll treat anything of the sort as some grave sin against the Republic.\n\nThe filibuster is probably the best example.  Yes, it has been used more now than any other time (you mentioned it and I agree, so I'm not going to waste my time finding a link).  But you also have to look at the [voting record of the major legislation that was passed - its is far less bipartisan now than it was under Bush](http://keithhennessey.com/2010/02/23/bipartisan-successes/) - this link is old, but things have not gotten better in the years since.  I think this is almost self-reinforcing, though.  Democrats are able to pass legislation without much Republican input, so Republicans filibuster.  Because Republicans filibuster, Democrats decide to try and go without Republican support... and so on.\n\nThat's one thing I think Obama could do to break.

They say they aren't actually delaying the mandate, but rather the reporting (and therefore enforcement).  Could ambiguity such as this allow future presidents to ignore parts of laws they don't like\n* Obama has claimed that if Congress does not act on immigration, [he will do so on his own](http://thinkprogress.org/immigration/2013/08/13/2459741/rubio-immigration-reform-daca-comparison/).  Remember, if Obama can loosen immigration requirements without Congressional action, the next President could do the opposite just as easily.\n\nAnd I could go on.  What drives me nuts about most of this issues is you will find those who are more than happy to give Obama these powers.  But I have a feeling when the next Republican president gains power, they'll treat anything of the sort as some grave sin against the Republic.\n\nThe filibuster is probably the best example.  Yes, it has been used more now than any other time (you mentioned it and I agree, so I'm not going to waste my time finding a link).

I think this is almost self-reinforcing, though.  Democrats are able to pass legislation without much Republican input, so Republicans filibuster.  Because Republicans filibuster, Democrats decide to try and go without Republican support... and so on.\n\nThat's one thing I think Obama could do to break.

Many would choose to sacrifice on food to feed their other desires.

Did you lose your job (and not get fired)?  Then you get a set amount per week.  It does not increase the longer you're unemployed (and in some states if you don't claim that week you don't get it period).  \n\nUnemployment insurance also was never designed to be a replacement to live off of - its there to make sure you can carry on until you find a new job.  Now, if your career just went \"poof\" for other reasons - even food stamps won't help that.  What you need is something *entirely* different.\n\n&gt;It does not serve a \"nearly identical\" function - it can only be spent on food. Cash is very, very different in that it can be spent on anything. That is a very fundamental difference.\n\nAs I said in *my reply*, it is restricted.  We're talking around each other.  In personal finance/accounting, a cash equivalent is anything that can be spent like cash (in the business world its slightly different, more focused on returns and liquidity).  That includes everything from gift cards to bank notes.  Basically, if you can use that instrument to convert directly from it to some product (without incurring debt in doing so, which makes it a credit instrument) it is a cash equivalent.  It can be unrestricted (say, AmEx gift card), temporarily restricted (you cannot use it for 30 days) or permanently restricted (you can only use it for certain items).  But they are all cash equivalents.  Its just a definition.\n\n&gt;Except that $100 is restricted. Which is a very, very important difference.\n\nIts an important *distinction* but might be no different.  If I were to give you a $100 gift card that could only be spent at Amazon.com, its functionally the same as cash, given all that Amazon sells.  The likelihood of you being able to spend it is very high.  Now, say I gave you a gift card to EroticLeftHandedDogWhistlesforRedFoxes.com, most likely you're not going to be able to spend it for something you would otherwise.  In the last case, it really is a net add to your total spending.  But with the Amazon giftcard, it might not be.

Anyway, let's look at how \"normal\" unemployment insurance works:\n\n&gt;You must meet the State requirements for wages earned or time worked during an established period of time referred to as a \"base period\". (In most States, this is usually the first four out of the last five completed calendar quarters prior to the time that your claim is filed.)\n\nThen, once your claim is filed, you don't necessarily start receiving payouts immediately. Can take up to another month, I hear three weeks is typical. So we have five month potential delay time from someone being unemployed to start receiving insurance. So there's a little wiggle room there. Let me look at a graph for unemployment spending... [Here.](http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/images/pubs-images/43xxx/43734-land-Figure2.png)\n\nSo it looks like \"regular and extended benefits\" went up as jobs were lost, and then started going down again, exactly as expected from the mechanics we have hashed out for \"standard\" unemployment insurance. \n\n&gt;You are considered potentially eligible for the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program if you have a Connecticut unemployment claim, and:\n\n&gt;You filed an unemployment claim **effective May 7, 2006, or later;**\n\n&gt;You are fully unemployed, **or partially unemployed and working part-time,** as of July 6, 2008;\n\n&gt;You have no rights to unemployment benefits from any other state, the federal government or Canada;\n\n&gt;You are legally authorized to work in the United States;\n\n&gt;You are able and available for and seeking employment.\n\nSo my quick googling of emergency unemployment insurance looks like it turns up an explanation for increased unemployment spending as jobs were not being lost, which is that those emergency benefits have different requirements.

In that case, how do \"those here illegally...charge the same amount for their services\"? the individuals themselves don't engage in that aspect of the business, they're paid a set amount per hour or per job.  nor do they have to worry about the fines from the government, they risk something more devastating, which is possible deportation!\n\ni guess i would imagine that most people would want to contract with a registered business, at least from the aspect of plausible deniability, not unlike Wal-Mart and others do it.\n\nbut to get back on topic, (and looking at it from an employer's perspective) perhaps it would be a wash? sure you could pay the illegals less per hour (or per job) than if they were here legally, but the other side of the coin is the risk/reward aspect of free market principles.  You take on more risk by hiring illegals, and in return you demand more reward, which in this case is more profit.  As an employer, you would take that 1.40 as \"reward\" for the \"risk\" of hiring illegals.  So in your example, he wouldn't have paid his employee ~7% more because as an illegal he's not required to pay that amount in taxes.\n\nnow, if we legalized all the illegals, what would happen? we give them all a tax ID number, and there would be some flooding of the market. (it's asinine to assume anything other than that a certain percentage would simply continue to work under the table for cash)  Wages would go down until they hit a new equilibrium (stopped only by minimum wage) for those who work legally (not unlike the system now), and those who work illegally will still make less than the prevailing wage. (and the employer will still take more in profit as \"reward\").\n\nand yes it seems like this will happen to more than just the bottom of the labor market.  I would imagine a newly-minted taxpayer ID number would allow those with the free-market skills to take the kinds of jobs they're capable of without the fear of getting deported keeping them from advancing (both themselves and the country).

A common complaint of unions is that they just take workers money, work come negotiation time every couple of years, and just hang around with the \"liberals\" and do their bidding for the rest of time. (even though the guys and gals paying their dues would rather be shooting the animals rather than saving them)\n\ni'm not saying they're entirely wrong, and a little look back and we can find a model for how unions can add value to justify their existence.  but that only works if employers see the value in the work the union does.  If a union-sponsored training program open to union members that takes the place of or works in conjunction with, say, the community college system were to come about then i would have to do my best to slander or discredit it in some way.

U could even argue that circumstances out of my control (parents money-making ability, how well they raised me, etc.) determined whether i was prohibited from getting this far.\n\nso perhaps i can see the point you're trying to make, but from my experience i can't see how that's a knock on unions or the Mandatory Union Representation law.

In California and New York, they are indeed coming for people's guns. It is happening. And if Feinstein thought for one minute that she could get away with it, yes, without a doubt I have no trouble believing that. To imagine that the real goal is just to do away with \"100-round magazines and assault rifles\" that pretty much no one owns anyways and are never used in any sort of violent crime is absurd.\n\n&gt;  At most they're trying to come for your 100-round magazines and assault rifles.\n\nLeaving aside my qualification above...

[Get a load of this gif.](http://www.gun-nuttery.com/rtc.gif) It tracks changes in state gun restrictions since the late 1980s.\n\nEach state turning blue represents a state that passed \"shall issue\" carry laws. Every state that turns green is a \"don't even need to ask permission if you arn't a felon\" state. Every time one of those states turn green or blue, that is several million ordinary people who start to carry a firearm daily.\n\nAlso, in every single state crime has gone down. Every single one. Nationwide, since the peak in 1991, we've cut the violent crime rate, including criminal homicide, in half. **Half!**\n\nThis is why the gun grabbers have lost. This is why they tried to go for background checks and so-called \"assault weapons\" instead of trying to ban handguns. They tried, and they lost there too, because people aren't stupid. This is why, rather than have a rational discussion, which they *refuse* to do, they hold up pictures of scary looking rifles with scopes on them and expect America to piss its collective pants.\n\nI too would love to have a rational gun discussion.

Sokolow\n\nif you read and understand this stuff, you would look back and say to yourself \"wow, it really IS essentially delusional to just point at the text of an amendment and attempt to make an argument based on it!\"\n", "id": "t1_c9rwnyn", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c9rv70p", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431333873, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1dkxlr", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9rwnyn", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1367615697", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1dkxlr", "selftext": "also, you're right again.  the 2A does preclude the government from banning any weapons in *which they don't have the right to do so*.  but once again, no amendment is limitless. the government has an important function to regulate within the bounds of the Constitution, and i can't imagine that you would want to make the argument that any amendment is limitless or immune from regulation within the bounds of the constitution.\n\nif we're going to have a rational discussion, we can't make unsubstantiated claims like \"changes in state-level gun permitting schemes had something to do with decreasing crime in the United States.\"  Sorry :( ", "id": "t1_c9rwrb1", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;  the 2A does preclude the government from banning any weapons in which they don't have the right to do so.\n\nI don't even understand what you could mean by a statement like this. The government doesn't have the right to restrict weapons, except the weapons they decide they have the right to restrict?\n\nI'm now going to touch on the Supreme Court cases you cited in your other post, in the interests of conciseness.\n\n&gt; Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District (and Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier)\n\nThese apply strictly to minors in public schools, I don't see the relevance. This speaks more to the particular legal status of minors than it does to the rights of the people as a whole.\n\n&gt; Roth V. United States\n\n...and Miller v. California, are in my opinion bad rulings. I generally agree with Holmes's \"fire in a crowded theater\" metaphor. From Holmes's ruling:\n\n&gt; The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent.\n\nTo paraphrase that, if *the words themselves* are false and harmful, that's not protected speech. But that \"unprotected\" status in my opinion does not limit the first amendment. Similarly, if I shoot someone unprovoked, putting me in jail does not limit the second.\n\nThe Miller test does not meet that bar, in my opinion.\n\n&gt; New York v. Quarles\n\nThe Miranda warning itself is not the fifth amendment, it is a mechanism. Quarles *still had the right to remain silent.* That is, the police could not nullify his rights as a citizen. That's not what the public safety exception means.\n\n&gt; United States v. Sokolow\n\nThe agents obviously did have probable cause to search, which is what the judges ruled. This is in no way an exception to the fourth.\n\nI don't mean to portray myself as a constitutional scholar, I am not. Armchair student at best. Nor do I really want to depend on the constitution as my sole argument, because I feel that I can do better than argument from authority, and you deserve better. And certainly other cases can be cited (like Miller) where the Court obviously curtails the Constitution, I'm not saying they don't do that, I'm saying it's not right.\n\nBut yeah, I'd rather talk facts than case law, really.\n\nI gotta run, I'm gonna miss my bus.

In 10 years, more than half of the 1-percenters drop out of it.\n\nb) children don't fill tax returns. And the Census (and the PSID) uses top coding - the questionnaire offers categories of incoming, with the highest being \"above $250,000\". Therefore Census based data isn't useful for the study of very high incomes. Which means there's a lack of long longitudinal data for intergenerational social mobility involving very high (or very low) incomes, so studies are focused on short-term mobility.\n\nThe Treasury published a paper in 2006 studying relative social mobility, including top 1% earners, in a 10 year period. Check table 1, page 7.\n\n57.4% of the top 1% of households in 1996 had dropped to a lower income group by 2005 and 13% had dropped out of the top 10%. About 8% of the top 1% in 2005 was out of the top 10% in 1996 - so middle class and poorer households.\n\nhttp://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/Documents/incomemobilitystudy03-08revise.pdf\n\nIf you're interested in the answer for quintiles, then this chart offers a decent summary: \n\nhttp://imgur.com/eRSGIlI\n\nThe source of data was the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, a representative sample of 0-18 years old in 1968 that were tracked for 35 years (the average age of the top-1% is 47 year old).\n\nBasically it shows 39% of the children born in top-20% families remain there and 42% of the children born in bottom-20% families stay poor. Those born in the middle quintiles - lower, middle and upper middle-class - have more or less even chances of becoming really rich or really poor.\n\nSource: Economic Mobility in America, by Sawhill et al\n\nAs an additional note, I think people tend to focus too much on relative social mobility and the 1%. I think it's important to note that 4/5 Americans are richer than their parents or that the percentage of wealth owned by the top-1% is smaller now than 100 years ago.\n\n\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "intergenerational social mobility: you posted a very good longitudinal study from the United States.

In any case, I think the NRA has plenty of legitimacy from its base. It has around 5 million members; for reference, the ACLU has 500,000. 41% of Americans view the NRA in a positive light (and 34% in a negative light).

If that makes sense...\n\nIn my opinion, the gun control people have traditionally been the ones to escalate the issue. When was the last time a US congressman introduced a pro-gun law out of the blue? If I had to guess, I'd say the FOPA in 1986 (into which a senator inserted more gun control, in a way that broke the rules of the senate). Since then, we've had the Brady bill, 1994 AWB, expansions of the NICS system, and Feinstein's attempts to renew the AWB pretty much every year since 2004. Before that, we had bans on guns that are invisible to x-rays (which don't exist), bans on 'armor-piercing bullets' (which aren't necessarily armor piercing), the 1968 GCA, the 1934 NFA, and more. I don't think you can say that there's really a pro-gun paradigm in the federal government.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1ckqrt", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "FlyingSquirrelTyphus", "id": "t1_c9itcpg", "parent_id": "t1_c9i6su6", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431495062, "controversiality": 0, "body": "The NRA achieved legitimacy before their lobbying arm ever accomplished anything.

I am not discounting the power of the NRA, but I am arguing that their power derives from: A)their role as the primary gun safety, early gun education, and gun issues awareness group in America B)their success in advocating for pro-gun policies c)their ability to shift the gun debate through legal and political avenues d)many Americans like guns.\n\nI completely disagree about the escalation point. The NRA has been pushing legal test cases for years in an attempt to get the courts to create new precedent that favors wide open gun policy, which they do, which is met with increased gun control efforts to conform the laws to new cases. Heck, in GA, we had several very strong pro-gun bills come up during the legislature this year. I get that these aren't federal bills being introduced, but guns are addressed almost ever year by at least a couple state legislatures and often times it is expanding access or concealed carry locations. I think it is also important to point out that the Brady Bill, AWB, NICS, and the 1968 GCA all passed with bipartisan support. Reagan in fact supported the Brady Bill and the AWB. I mention that since Reagan seems to have a reputation for being incredibly pro-gun. The reason why I think the we have institutionalized pro-gun policies is that the status quo is to reject any gun control reforms pretty much out of hand.

It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court\u2019s opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms\" (DC. V. Heller)\n\nthe need to regulate firearms in order to effectively prohibit \"the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill\" and to ensure the \"laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms\" is \"longstanding\" and a controlling state interest. now, along with that comes with fees. those are inevitable and as long as not so much to be considered \"egregious\" are simply part of doing business. and even if they were, they have a \"controlling state interest\" that precludes it from being disenfranchisment.\"\n\n*note my definition of disenfranchisment doesn't stray far from it in the legal kind of sense, not the libertarian-esque argument that you could chase down the rabbit hole and end up with arguments such as:\n\nfor example, you could say that the government's disenfranchising poor people by forcing them to purchase airbags, seat belts, and traction control in cars because it pushes the price of them up and out of reach of the poor. \n\n*also of note this was only used to make the comparison between the concepts of \"controlling state interests\" with regards to voter IDs and gun ownership.  the point was that DC v Heller allows registration and the subsequent paying of fees when it says what i quoted above, whereas voter ID laws need to show that there was some sort of statistically measurable fraud or public confidence loss in the voting process in order to justify the steamrolling of rights.\n\nas Scalia said in DC. V. Heller, no rights are unlimited.  so you then have to ask yourself, \"well, under what circumstances can rights be abridged by the government?\" i chose the \"controlling state interest\" argument.\n\nyou can't yell \"fire\" in a crowded theater in violation of your 1st amendment rights, due to controlling state interest.\n\nyou have to pay to register or background check yourself and your guns in violation of your 2nd amendment rights in order to to keep them out of the hands of criminals or the mentally unstable, due controlling state interest.\n\nif you could prove some sort of controlling state interest in preventing fraud in the voting system (such as statistically significant numbers or widespread loss in confidence in the institution), then it'd be ok to abridge the right to vote for people without an ID. \n\netc. etc.    ", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;if it's a bad source, then don't use it. if you're admitting its not a good source, i won't bother to read or respond to it. your source isn't very strong, and i don't feel like responding to the pro-gun folk.\n\nI didn't say it was bad, but not the best. There was a great quote I read recently that I was wishing I could link to where the Chicago guys are specifically saying they intend to limit the 2A with the use of taxes. The source cited is not the best in that it isn't what I had in mind. However, it is actually a pretty good source when discussing the Racist implications of gun control laws of the past and present, which addresses the Jim Crow comments directly. In that way, it is an excellent source. I see nothing to dispute it's holding of previous gun control policy intended directly to have the same effect as Jim Crow laws.\n\nAs for fees/etc, the only infringing I see is when it directly relates to the \"keep and bear\" portion of the 2A, which doesn't include the original purchase of the gun.\n\nThat is not to say that I don't see infringement happening. I do, but I just don't see a constitutional basis against it as a tax as I do with the \"keep and bear\" stuff. \n\nDisenfranchisement is not relevant here, just infringement. State interests are relevant here, but only in the sense that it fits within federal authority, as in a tax. SCOTUS has held repeatedly that congress can impose taxes to limit undesirable behavior (probably most recently in the Obamacare decision). If the government can state that gun *sales* (background checks or sale taxes) or *manufacturing* (federal excise tax) are undesirable, there's nothing to stop them from taxing that.\n\nHowever, gun *ownership* is specifically protected against in the 2A. Passing a gun tax where you had to pay per gun (once or yearly) would be thrown out in court in a heartbeat. Stating that you have to have a license to posses a gun (and then a yearly fee on a license) is on extremely shaky ground, and I don't think will hold up in court much longer in the future. This goes way beyond what the court has upheld (requiring a license for concealed carry, as this goes beyond the home), and I know of no decision upholding such.\n\nAs for the mentally ill, it seems this restriction has not been decided by the SCOTUS. Heller, in the long explanation states:\n&gt;Although *we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment*, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or\nlaws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws impos\u00ading conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. [26]\n\nAnd note 26:\n\n&gt;We identify these presumptively lawful regulatory measures only as examples; our list does not purport to be exhaustive.\n\nWhat they are doing is punting on this one, as is required as this was not addressed in the case at hand. They are saying that the existing prohibitions are to be presumed lawful until specifically addressed.\n\nFrom this, I can't completely agree with you that the reason for the existence of these existing restrictions is due to a \"controlling state interest\", and that any other such state interests can be used to justify any other restrictions.\n\nAs to this balance between state interests and a constitutionally guaranteed right, the Heller decision states (including comparisons to the 1A):\n&gt; We know of no other enumerated constitutional right whose core protection has been subjected to a freestanding \u201cinterest-balancing\u201d approach. The very enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government\u2014even the Third Branch of Government\u2014the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth insist\u00ading upon. A constitutional guarantee subject to future judges\u2019 assessments of its usefulness is no constitutional guarantee at all. \n&gt;Constitutional rights are enshrined with the scope they were understood to have when the people adopted them, whether or not future legislatures or (yes) even future judges think that scope too broad. We would not apply an \u201cinterest-balancing\u201d approach to the prohibi\u00adtion of a peaceful neo-Nazi march through Skokie. See National Socialist Party of America v. Skokie, 432 U. S. 43 (1977) (per curiam). The First Amendment contains the freedom-of-speech guarantee that the people ratified, which included exceptions for obscenity, libel, and disclo\u00adsure of state secrets, but not for the expression of ex\u00adtremely unpopular and wrong-headed views. The Second Amendment is no different. Like the First, it is the very product of an interest-balancing by the people\u2014which JUSTICE BREYER would now conduct for them anew. And whatever else it leaves to future evaluation, it surely elevates above all other interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.\n\nSo what he is saying here is that legal restrictions on the 2A right are those that are understood to have existed when the 2A was ratified. When it was ratified, it was subject to this \"state interest\" balance, but only to the extent of the state interest that existed at that time. Redefining the state interest today should not alter the scope of the restrictions placed on the right in the name of such state interests. The restrictions are constant, short of constitutional amendment, in effect.\n\nNow, lets look at these restrictions you mention in light of this.\n\n1. The limit of shouting \"fire\" in a theater still applies, as it was understood to be so restricted at ratification.\n\n2. Registration of arms should not apply, as it was not understood at the time. In fact, arms didn't even have serial numbers at the time, so any concept of registration could not have been imaginable to those who ratified the 2A. As such, a registration requirement is an infringement.\n\n3. Background checks on sales. Infringement or not doesn't matter. Fed's have been granted the power to regulate interstate commerce, and states their own commerce. Requiring a fee for this is a tax, and also a granted power. [**NOTE:** However, that the Federal gov doesn't have jurisdiction to force background checks for sales that don't cross state lines or involve federally licensed parties. A state does. This matters as to the implementation of background checks only, but the power has been granted to one form of government or the other, and is not reserved to individuals]. [**NOTE2:** I'm not sure the commerce clause will apply the same to non-sale transfers, such as inheriting a weapon].\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1ce4q9", "selftext": "ummm... when the constitution was written, Americans had a 4th amendment right to be secure in their property which of course included the constitutionally gauranteed right to own other human beings (african slaves)....\n\nand even when you couldn't own them, SCOTUS said they weren't citizens.\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "And that was the shitty law of the time, and the SCOTUS confirmed that.

Heller, no rights are unlimited.  so you then have to ask yourself, \"well, under what circumstances can rights be abridged by the government?\" i chose the \"controlling state interest\" argument.\n\nyou can't yell \"fire\" in a crowded theater in violation of your 1st amendment rights, due to controlling state interest.\n\nyou have to pay to register or background check yourself and your guns in violation of your 2nd amendment rights in order to to keep them out of the hands of criminals or the mentally unstable, due controlling state interest.\n\nif you could prove some sort of controlling state interest in preventing fraud in the voting system (such as statistically significant numbers or widespread loss in confidence in the institution), then it'd be ok to abridge the right to vote for people without an ID. \n\netc. etc.    ", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;if it's a bad source, then don't use it. if you're admitting its not a good source, i won't bother to read or respond to it. your source isn't very strong, and i don't feel like responding to the pro-gun folk.\n\nI didn't say it was bad, but not the best. There was a great quote I read recently that I was wishing I could link to where the Chicago guys are specifically saying they intend to limit the 2A with the use of taxes. The source cited is not the best in that it isn't what I had in mind. However, it is actually a pretty good source when discussing the Racist implications of gun control laws of the past and present, which addresses the Jim Crow comments directly. In that way, it is an excellent source. I see nothing to dispute it's holding of previous gun control policy intended directly to have the same effect as Jim Crow laws.\n\nAs for fees/etc, the only infringing I see is when it directly relates to the \"keep and bear\" portion of the 2A, which doesn't include the original purchase of the gun.\n\nThat is not to say that I don't see infringement happening. I do, but I just don't see a constitutional basis against it as a tax as I do with the \"keep and bear\" stuff. \n\nDisenfranchisement is not relevant here, just infringement. State interests are relevant here, but only in the sense that it fits within federal authority, as in a tax. SCOTUS has held repeatedly that congress can impose taxes to limit undesirable behavior (probably most recently in the Obamacare decision). If the government can state that gun *sales* (background checks or sale taxes) or *manufacturing* (federal excise tax) are undesirable, there's nothing to stop them from taxing that.\n\nHowever, gun *ownership* is specifically protected against in the 2A. Passing a gun tax where you had to pay per gun (once or yearly) would be thrown out in court in a heartbeat. Stating that you have to have a license to posses a gun (and then a yearly fee on a license) is on extremely shaky ground, and I don't think will hold up in court much longer in the future. This goes way beyond what the court has upheld (requiring a license for concealed carry, as this goes beyond the home), and I know of no decision upholding such.\n\nAs for the mentally ill, it seems this restriction has not been decided by the SCOTUS. Heller, in the long explanation states:\n&gt;Although *we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment*, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or\nlaws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws impos\u00ading conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. [26]\n\nAnd note 26:\n\n&gt;We identify these presumptively lawful regulatory measures only as examples; our list does not purport to be exhaustive.\n\nWhat they are doing is punting on this one, as is required as this was not addressed in the case at hand. They are saying that the existing prohibitions are to be presumed lawful until specifically addressed.\n\nFrom this, I can't completely agree with you that the reason for the existence of these existing restrictions is due to a \"controlling state interest\", and that any other such state interests can be used to justify any other restrictions.\n\nAs to this balance between state interests and a constitutionally guaranteed right, the Heller decision states (including comparisons to the 1A):\n&gt; We know of no other enumerated constitutional right whose core protection has been subjected to a freestanding \u201cinterest-balancing\u201d approach. The very enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government\u2014even the Third Branch of Government\u2014the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth insist\u00ading upon. A constitutional guarantee subject to future judges\u2019 assessments of its usefulness is no constitutional guarantee at all. \n&gt;Constitutional rights are enshrined with the scope they were understood to have when the people adopted them, whether or not future legislatures or (yes) even future judges think that scope too broad. We would not apply an \u201cinterest-balancing\u201d approach to the prohibi\u00adtion of a peaceful neo-Nazi march through Skokie. See National Socialist Party of America v. Skokie, 432 U. S. 43 (1977) (per curiam). The First Amendment contains the freedom-of-speech guarantee that the people ratified, which included exceptions for obscenity, libel, and disclo\u00adsure of state secrets, but not for the expression of ex\u00adtremely unpopular and wrong-headed views. The Second Amendment is no different. Like the First, it is the very product of an interest-balancing by the people\u2014which JUSTICE BREYER would now conduct for them anew. And whatever else it leaves to future evaluation, it surely elevates above all other interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.\n\nSo what he is saying here is that legal restrictions on the 2A right are those that are understood to have existed when the 2A was ratified. When it was ratified, it was subject to this \"state interest\" balance, but only to the extent of the state interest that existed at that time. Redefining the state interest today should not alter the scope of the restrictions placed on the right in the name of such state interests. The restrictions are constant, short of constitutional amendment, in effect.\n\nNow, lets look at these restrictions you mention in light of this.\n\n1. The limit of shouting \"fire\" in a theater still applies, as it was understood to be so restricted at ratification.\n\n2. Registration of arms should not apply, as it was not understood at the time. In fact, arms didn't even have serial numbers at the time, so any concept of registration could not have been imaginable to those who ratified the 2A. As such, a registration requirement is an infringement.\n\n3. Background checks on sales. Infringement or not doesn't matter. Fed's have been granted the power to regulate interstate commerce, and states their own commerce. Requiring a fee for this is a tax, and also a granted power. [**NOTE:** However, that the Federal gov doesn't have jurisdiction to force background checks for sales that don't cross state lines or involve federally licensed parties. A state does. This matters as to the implementation of background checks only, but the power has been granted to one form of government or the other, and is not reserved to individuals]. [**NOTE2:** I'm not sure the commerce clause will apply the same to non-sale transfers, such as inheriting a weapon].\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1ce4q9", "selftext": "ummm... when the constitution was written, Americans had a 4th amendment right to be secure in their property which of course included the constitutionally gauranteed right to own other human beings (african slaves)....\n\nand even when you couldn't own them, SCOTUS said they weren't citizens.\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "And that was the shitty law of the time, and the SCOTUS confirmed that.

But I don't think his interpretation supports the point you're trying to make. In fact it almost proves the opposite. But just the same, I did break it down to philosophy, because that's how politics came to be. And at some point, that's what every law is based on- some founding philosophy. As for the bible, I thought you would quote Mathew 22:15! \n\nSo I understand that it would still be able to function, but you assert just not help as many people. And I'm fully prepared to agree with that. But here's where my reticence comes in.  Every dollar the government *doesn't spend* is a dollar it doesn't take from the taxpayers. The proposal I've always heard that weens government subsidized programs off the government is to issue tax credits, dollar for dollar (with a cap) for donations given to a charity that handles that need. The average tax payer probably only has a couple of cents of all their taxes going towards PP. But if they choose to donate a dollar, it behooves them because they now have a $1 tax credit to claim. It benefits PP because they could potentially raise more money than they are right now. They won't lose money, if someone donates $1 to PP, the gov't doesn't spend $1 on PP. It just reduces how much the government spends on it, but they still get the same revenue. And it eases the burden (no matter how small) the government places on taxpayers who disagree with it. No one would lose services, they could only gain and have it be even more affordable. This seems so win-win. But for some reason, the government likes to raise taxes, rather than offering a credit to encourage desired actions. They even brought it up during the Supreme Court hearings for the ACA- if you want people to buy health insurance, why are you penalizing them by making them pay an additional tax, rather than offering a credit that would offset their expense?

In addition to this, no one has ever accused the government of being efficient haha. They take money from you, spend a sizable portion on themselves, and offer it back to you through programs with strings attached. For the most part (and I'm being general here because there are some rotten charitable organizations), private charities are much more efficient than government. So you're in the most charitable country in the world, with charities administrating services more efficiently than the government. The trouble is, how do we get more folks to donate? \n\nMy (well not my, it's been proposed for a while now) solution is to offer tax credits, dollar for dollar, to everyone who donates to a charity that handles a societal problem that the government currently funds. This weens people depending on that service off relying on the government for its funding, it incentivizes more people to donate/donate more than they already do, and get more out of that charity since you're getting a better bang for your buck rather than doing it through the gov't. Best of all, no one is being forced to do anything against their will. It's all voluntary. Could you imagine how charitable big corporations would be if they were offered a tax credit (not a deduction) for how much they gave away? Obviously there would be a cap on it. But right now the tax code is not very encouraging to people who donate. Most people take the standard deduction, and can't itemize charitable contributions. So my \"proposal\" would get more money to planned parenthood, less government spending, and none of the evils of taxation. And if people don't use this credit, then the program continues to get funding from the government and no one loses a service.

The average tax payer probably only has a couple of cents of all their taxes going towards PP. But if they choose to donate a dollar, it behooves them because they now have a $1 tax credit to claim. It benefits PP because they could potentially raise more money than they are right now. They won't lose money, if someone donates $1 to PP, the gov't doesn't spend $1 on PP. It just reduces how much the government spends on it, but they still get the same revenue. And it eases the burden (no matter how small) the government places on taxpayers who disagree with it. No one would lose services, they could only gain and have it be even more affordable. This seems so win-win. But for some reason, the government likes to raise taxes, rather than offering a credit to encourage desired actions. They even brought it up during the Supreme Court hearings for the ACA- if you want people to buy health insurance, why are you penalizing them by making them pay an additional tax, rather than offering a credit that would offset their expense?

I haven't heard of a newer one. However, I've been to gun shows, and can confirm that 99.9% of sales there go through background checks. (Because all of the dealers are FFLs).

(besides obviously running afoul of the 2nd Amendment)\n\nPreventing felons from possessing weapons, AFAIK, does not conflict with the 2A, and this was held as such in the Heller SCOTUS decision, so I have no problem with that restriction. In general, I support the other groups of people that are excluded in the Heller decision as well, but with the caveat that restriction of this right should be subject to due process. \n\nDue process is automatic in the case of a felony conviction, but no framework currently exists for the application of due process for restricting the right when it comes to mentally ill. There was a case recently where a woman was forcibly committed under false grounds, and that was used as a basis for confiscation. That sort of thing has to be prevented.\n\n&gt; i'd say it's not a pre-requisite for registration to enforce a possession law.\nIt's not a prerequisite unless you want the policy to actually prevent any violence. For instance, in most states possession of a weapon during the commission of a felony is just a \"tack on\" charge where it's just used to rack up penalties... but could never prevent the felony. It's what prosecutors use to cover their ass if they can't make the other charges stick.\n\nBut to prevent anything, you would have to know that the felon possessed a weapon outside of the commission of a crime. Registration is required for that, otherwise you would have to search them without due cause (4A violation). Otherwise there's no way to get the weapon before the commission of a crime or other condition of reasonable suspicion (and the same standards apply to that suspicion for felons and non-felons).\n\nSo, while a law against possession can be on the books, it will never prevent anything without registration.\n\n&gt; so there's only 2 reasons why you couldn't pass a background check (ie acquire registration), i think. mental defect and felon status.\n\nNICS form 4473 lists the following 11 questions (answers required to pass in parenthesis):\na. Are you the purchaser/trasnferee of the firearm (to prevent straw purchases)(YES)\nb. Are you under indictment or info for a felony (NO)\nc. Have you been convicted of a felony (NO)\nd. Are you a fugative (NO)\ne. Are you an unlawfuluser, or addicted to, pot, depressant, stims, narcotics, or controlled substances.(NO)\nf.

I haven't heard of a newer one. However, I've been to gun shows, and can confirm that 99.9% of sales there go through background checks. (Because all of the dealers are FFLs). As the washington post and others have [pointed out](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/the-stale-claim-that-40-percent-of-gun-sales-lack-background-checks/2013/01/20/e42ec050-629a-11e2-b05a-605528f6b712_blog.html), even that ancient 40% statistic is on extremely shaky grounds, due to poor design and extremely small sample size.\n\n&gt;not in all circumstances, what about the law that says felons can't possess weapons? (besides obviously running afoul of the 2nd Amendment)\n\nPreventing felons from possessing weapons, AFAIK, does not conflict with the 2A, and this was held as such in the Heller SCOTUS decision, so I have no problem with that restriction. In general, I support the other groups of people that are excluded in the Heller decision as well, but with the caveat that restriction of this right should be subject to due process. \n\nDue process is automatic in the case of a felony conviction, but no framework currently exists for the application of due process for restricting the right when it comes to mentally ill. There was a case recently where a woman was forcibly committed under false grounds, and that was used as a basis for confiscation. That sort of thing has to be prevented.\n\n&gt; i'd say it's not a pre-requisite for registration to enforce a possession law.\nIt's not a prerequisite unless you want the policy to actually prevent any violence. For instance, in most states possession of a weapon during the commission of a felony is just a \"tack on\" charge where it's just used to rack up penalties... but could never prevent the felony. It's what prosecutors use to cover their ass if they can't make the other charges stick.\n\nBut to prevent anything, you would have to know that the felon possessed a weapon outside of the commission of a crime. Registration is required for that, otherwise you would have to search them without due cause (4A violation). Otherwise there's no way to get the weapon before the commission of a crime or other condition of reasonable suspicion (and the same standards apply to that suspicion for felons and non-felons).\n\nSo, while a law against possession can be on the books, it will never prevent anything without registration.\n\n&gt; so there's only 2 reasons why you couldn't pass a background check (ie acquire registration), i think. mental defect and felon status.\n\nNICS form 4473 lists the following 11 questions (answers required to pass in parenthesis):\na. Are you the purchaser/trasnferee of the firearm (to prevent straw purchases)(YES)\nb. Are you under indictment or info for a felony (NO)\nc. Have you been convicted of a felony (NO)\nd.

Established under Title 10 and Title 32 of the U.S. Code, state National Guard serves as part of the first-line defense for the United States.[35] The state National Guard is divided up into units stationed in each of the 50 states and U.S. territories and operates under their respective state governor or territorial government.[36] The National Guard may be called up for active duty by the state governors or territorial commanding generals to help respond to domestic emergencies and disasters, such as those caused by hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes.[36]\n\n&gt;The National Guard of the United States is a military reserve force composed of state National Guard members or units under federally recognized active or inactive armed force service for the United States.[37][38] Created by the Militia Act of 1903, the National Guard of the United States is a joint reserve component of the United States Army and the United States Air Force.\n\nSo, \"National Guard\" has more than one meaning. The US NG is part of the us Military (*not* a militia), the State's NG is an *organized militia*.\n\nHowever, as from Heller, neither is the \"unorganized\" or \"citizens\" militia to which the 2A refers, as they were created by federal law and not in existence before the Constitution.\n\nAt the top of that article, the difference is further highlighted:\n\n* The organized militia created by the Militia Act of 1903, which split from the 1792 Uniform Militia forces, and consist of State militia forces, notably the National Guard and the Naval Militia.[2] The National Guard however, is not to be confused with the National Guard of the United States, which is a federally recognized reserve military force, although the two are linked.\n* The reserve militia[3] or unorganized militia, which is presently defined by the Militia Act of 1903 to consist of every able-bodied man of at least 17 and under 45 years of age who is not a member of the National Guard or Naval Militia.(That is, anyone who would be eligible for a draft.) Former members of the armed forces up to age 65 are also considered part of the \"unorganized militia\" per Sec 313 Title 32 of the US Code.[2]\n", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "id": "t1_c972xby", "parent_id": "t1_c96sklq", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431698010, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c972xby", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364925664", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "id": "t1_c96sklq", "parent_id": "t1_c96ptrg", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431702959, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96sklq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364878373", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "id": "t1_c96ptrg", "parent_id": "t1_c96ntbk", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431704254, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96ptrg", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364869412", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "id": "t1_c96ntbk", "parent_id": "t1_c96k4mx", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431705214, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96ntbk", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364863260", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "id": "t1_c96k4mx", "parent_id": "t1_c965kz6", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431706951, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96k4mx", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364853847", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "selftext": "As to straw purchases, I think we need to better define the actual offense.

They certainly didn't have to be complicit in helping private companies offer more benefits to their employees.  The government could have taxed the benefits just like cash wages had they wanted to, but it was a cheap/easy/minimally-government-handed way to increase health insurance consumption as to help \"provide for the...general welfare of the United States\" (Article1, Section 8, clause 1) \n\n2. the point of the remark was to show that if the OP wanted healthcare, he has no choice but to buy an individual plan through a private insurer no matter what the cost.  I went over the other options that exist in the marketplace for people that don't have health insurance and want it (such as joining the plan of a company he doesn't work for, or getting it through the government) and why they're not available to him.   \n\n3.

They would likely argue that it's untenable to (in practical terms) successfully straddle that line between socialist and capitalist.   The government has to force socialist kind of policies onto the marketplace against major corporations and ideologies (at a time when corporate donations to PACs and re-election coffers move the needle much farther and easier than constituents' wants and needs do) while at the same time keeping it capitalist by leaving the majority of the decision-making and execution to the profit-driven private sector.  People would argue that it's not possible to find a balance anyone would agree on, could be passed into law, and implemented as designed.\n\n&gt;Except then you make a mistake, which I bolded. Even if we adopted this sort of thing today, overall costs would not go down aside from the profit that the health insurance companies are making.\n\ntheir leveraging of universal healthcare is combined with a different way of going about doing healthcare entirely, such as government bargaining with providers, training for doctors, tort law, etc. I don't suggest that we simply insure the whole population while making no substantive changes to the system.   but the fact remains that one way that they keep costs down is by insuring everyone.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "The Basics: the government, during and after WW2, decided that America had to do something about the fact that the only people that had health insurance were the elderly, and that was like 20% of the population.  Hell, we rebuilt Europe and wanted to implement what they had done right.  So they looked around, saw that lots of people had jobs and lots of people didn't want the government providing healthcare, and decided on the path they would take.  they would use tax breaks (essentially exempt from taxation the money spent providing healthcare) to help businesses to offer health insurance to its workers as part of their compensation package, and that would get the number of Americans with health insurance up significantly in a short period of time.  The plan was never to cover everyone, it was to get the number of Americans with health insurance up from 20% in the easiest, fastest manner possible.\n\nwell, that basic idea hasn't changed in 60 years or so, leading to the following reasons why your health premiums are so high.\n\n1/2. under the current system, your employer pays into your health insurance, and you pay into it too.  If you're self employed, you're paying both the employer part and the employee part. \n\n1. Because you're self-employed and not a business, there's no government tax break for you to offer health insurance to yourself.\n\n2. you have no other choice.  you can't just say \"oh, well i like the plan that Northrup Grumman offers its employees, sign me up!\" because you can't. And because you are employed, you likely don't qualify for Medicaid. So your only choice is an individual plan, and the health insurance companies know that.\n\n3. every other developed country in the world leverages their whole population to spread out the cost and keep spending down while providing quality healthcare.  the more people you can get on your plan, the larger your pool of people, and the lower the premiums are.  As a self-employed individual, you're joining a comparatively TINY pool of people in which to spread the cost amongst, so your rate is sky high.    \n\n4. You can't buy insurance across state lines, which further diminishes your pool from which to spread the risk.  The premise behind that is each state faces different needs from health insurance.  For example, Pennsylvania with its coal mines is going to demand different levels of coverage for different things than like Hawaii.  If you could buy across state lines, then the state can't be sure you're getting good coverage that works for the people of that state. \n\n\nso to answer your questions directly:\n\nwhy do they suck? see above, its a combination of all those factors.\n\nwhy does it matter? its the way the system was designed.\n\nwhy the double standard? because we're trying to make a system do what it wasn't designed to do, and unsuprisingly, its not working.\n\nhow is this legal? i'd say the constitution's power to tax and spend.  some of it probably the Interstate commerce clause.\n\nfinally, my own question that is just seems logical: \n\nwhy don't we fix it? as a far right of center country (on a global scale) we value individual freedom a LOT, and distrust the government generally.  Some of us feel that health insurance is a luxury for those that can afford it rather than a necessity or an individual right.  Some of us agree that it's not a luxury, and we should all have it, but the government shouldn't be involved. (the less government interference in their lives, the better)  \n\nso until something changes, we'll continue to do what we've been for the past 60 years and rely on the system we've got.\n\nEdit: took some heat for the \"history\" section, so i cleaned it up without losing its meaning within the larger context of the OP's question.\n ", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I don't even know where to begin.\n\n&gt;The Basics: the government, right after WW2, decided that America had to do something about the fact that the only people that had health insurance were the elderly, and that was like 20% of the population. So they looked around, saw that lots of people had jobs and lots of people didn't want the government providing healthcare, and decided on the path they would take. they would use tax breaks to entice businesses to offer health insurance to its workers, and that would get the number of Americans with health insurance up significantly in a short period of time. The plan was never to cover everyone, it was to get the number of Americans with health insurance up from 20% in the easiest, fastest manner possible.\n\nEmployer provided health insurance (major medical) arouse during WW2 because of the wage freeze, but companies still needed to compete.  They decided to treat it as a sort of reimburseable expense (for example, if you turn in an out of pocket expense and your employer reimburses you, that is not income to you, but the corporation gets to deduct it as an expense).  That saved them taxes and provided a tangible benefit to employees.  The market then took over and it became a standard benefit of most employers.\n\n&gt;And because you are employed, you likely don't qualify for Medicaid. So your only choice is an individual plan, and the health insurance companies know that.\n\nNot sure what this has to do with anything.  The plans that are offered and priced are based on individual risks, which you then allude to here:\n\n&gt;every other developed country in the world leverages **their whole population to spread out the cost and keep spending down while providing quality healthcare.** the more people you can get on your plan, the larger your pool of people, and the lower the premiums are. As a self-employed individual, you're joining a comparatively TINY pool of people in which to spread the cost amongst, so your rate is sky high. \n\nExcept then you make a mistake, which I bolded.  Even if we adopted this sort of thing *today*, overall costs would not go down aside from the profit that the health insurance companies are making.  The only way to reduce costs is to do one or more of three things:\n\n1. Reduce consumption\n2. Reduce reimbursements/prices for procedures\n3. Refuse to cover procedures (an extreme of #2)\n\nAll three of those will be a degradation of healthcare.  If you don't allow people to consume as much (wait times, etc), that's a negative.  If you pay less for procedures, doctors/nurses/etc will leave on the margins.  And if you outright refuse to cover procedures, those who would have used it are harmed.\n\n&gt;You can't buy insurance across state lines, which further diminishes your pool from which to spread the risk. The premise behind that is each state faces different needs from health insurance. For example, Pennsylvania with its coal mines is going to demand different levels of coverage for different things than like Hawaii. If you could buy across state lines, then the state can't be sure you're getting good coverage that works for the people of that state. \n\nActually, you can thank federal law for that more than individual needs.  The vast majority of people in Penn will never need coverage for issues coal miners face.  That's just an excuse.  What this does, and you hinted at it, is break one market into 50 smaller markets (does DC have their own rules?), restricting competition.  Yes, some argue that there will be a race to the bottom, but that's only one way to compete - Neiman Marcus is a shining example that you can compete on premium.\n\nWe could solve the issue of health insurance if we used it as health insurance rather than some sort of pre-paid medical expense.  It should not cover routine preventative care - the way insurance is designed, it just inflates that cost.  Get back to major medical, use Medicaid/Medicare to help those who cannot cover the basic costs.  We're going to go that way anyway eventually since HDHP are on the rise.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;The only way to reduce costs is to do one or more of three things:\n\nUh, no.\n\nA lower average risk pool means you bring in far more money in premiums then you do paying out in comparison to a higher risk pool.

That \"higher risk\" pool's cost is still there, its just being spread among more people.  But the people in that pool are now paying the cost of the other people as well.  In total, the entire cost remains the same.  Insurance premiums are calculated as the change of an event occurring times the cost of treating that event.  Math doesn't change.\n\n&gt;Or we could not spend as much money on things which have no right costing that much like the vast majority of drugs used in hospitals. You could keep older machines which may not have the same speed and resolution as the newest toys but are more then adequate enough for the cursory search MRIs done on intake.\n\nSo you want to pay less for drugs used, presumably because they benefit people, and use older machines that do not give as much information.  You're reducing the quality of care.  That's a good thing?\n\n&gt;Reduce their costs. Subsidize or eliminate medical school debt through public hospital service. Adjust malpractice laws and make it so doctors who really shouldn't be doctors aren't doctors so they don't keep jacking up the malpractice rates.\n\nSo now you want to mess with the market, forcing all doctors who are not independently wealthy to go through certain hospitals to eliminate debt.  Then you're going to restrict the number of doctors... Yes, there are some doctors that probably shouldn't be in practice, but a good number of malpractice cases are just accidents and human errors.  You cannot eliminate those.\n\n&gt;That actually increases cost. Preventative care is almost absurdly cheaper then dealing with the problems that arise down the line. We're not talking even pennies on the dollar sometimes but pennies on the thousand. In fact if more people had access to routine preventative care and checkups claims that require significant portions of the pool to balance out will be much much rarer and costs will plummet.\n\nNot all preventive care would reduce cost, not in total.  Say that the risk of a group of 100 people getting a disease is 0.01% annually, with a cost of treatment of $10,000.  If that preventative care costs more than $100 (0.01 x 10k), you actually spend *more* trying to prevent the disease in that population than treating it.\n\nIn fact, you might actually spend *more* in the end because you might find out that the risk is actually 0.02%, but that extra .01% died before being detected.\n\nMost \"preventative care\" is really just aimed at early detection.  Nothing in my pap smear actually will prevent cancer.  Its just that if detected early, my chance of living is higher.

They're often untraceable and no one but the end-user gets held accountable for fencing, straw purchasing, or stealing them (and by the time they're found its often too late).  For them, an assault weapons ban and lots of regulation makes a ton of sense.  In large cities, folks are less gun-centric and there's just not a huge contingent of EXTREMELY PRO-GUN FOLK in major urban areas (predominantly on the coasts, places in Texas are probably exceptions) \n\npeople in the suburbs interact with guns in the same kind of way.  We don't really need them on a daily basis, often the land and freedom to just let a semi-automatic rifle rip just isn't there (without the neighbors calling the cops anyways) and the populace is generally uncomfortable with interacting with them in daily life.  City/suburban folk use them for different purposes and are more likely to balance aggregate safety against personal annoyance.     \n\nso consequently, the regulations are not onerous to a lot of folks, and at the very least gives law enforcement new tools in which to deter crime.  The impact on law-abiding citizens is minimal (they're often more than happy to follow common sense laws or give up a bit of personal freedom for aggregate good) and the EXTREMELY PRO-GUN FOLK are highly outnumbered. \n\nWe just don't see the situation as \"OMG. they're taking away my freedom, we can't do that, no matter what the cost\"\n\nso, seeing as you sound like an EXTREMELY PRO-GUN FOLK yourself, you're not likely to think the tradeoff of individual rights for aggregate good is worth it.  and it's ok, it's part of the process.\n\nhopefully you understand it better now.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1b315z", "selftext": "who said anything about assault weapons? \n\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1b315z", "selftext": "there, i fixed it.  my point had nothing to do with \"assault weapons\" and was purposely worded to attempt to not draw that argument into the debate, as it's plain irrelevant.\n\nso luckily you copied and pasted that response, otherwise you would have wasted (possibly) valuable minutes of your life. lol.", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "id": "t1_c93nvbj", "parent_id": "t1_c93nq2z", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431724801, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1364426053, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93nvbj", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364425039", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "unceunceunce", "id": "t1_c93nq2z", "parent_id": "t1_c93nldp", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431724736, "controversiality": 0, "body": "You used them as examples and mentioned the assault weapons ban, although I will admit I was lazy and just copy/pasted my response from a previous post.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1b315z", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93nq2z", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364424617", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "id": "t1_c93nldp", "parent_id": "t1_c93gacm", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431724679, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93nldp", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364424241", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "unceunceunce", "id": "t1_c93gacm", "parent_id": "t1_c935qd0", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431720923, "controversiality": 0, "body": "'Assault weapons' (which are no different than any other semi auto rifle aside from cosmetic features) are statistically a non issue when it comes to gun violence.

The military state becomes elevated above the civil. The inhabitants of territories, often the theatre of war, are unavoidably subjected to frequent infringements on their rights, which serve to weaken their sense of those rights; and by degrees the people are brought to consider the soldiery not only as their protectors, but as their superiors\" (federalist papers #26)\n\nso the constitution was written and it included the ability for the government to make wars and \"provide for the common defense\".\n\nbefore it got passed tho, people thought about it and said \"well hell, if we want to keep this whole standing army thing to a minimum, we have to rely on our citizens as soldiers.  If we're going to do that, we need to equip them as such\"\n\nSo, a well regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state.  Seeing as \"militia\" = free white landowning males residing in the states called into duty as necessary (and then dispersed after their job was done), we can't infringe their rights to keep and bear arms.  they have to be allowed to keep and bear arms that would allow them the provide for the security of a free state.\n\nso therefore, the right to \"keep and bear arms\" is directed at individuals, giving individuals said rights, unconnected with military service.  Military service is one way that individuals CAN use their arms, but certainly not the only one.\n\nnow, we just happen to be spitting in the faces of the founding fathers by not only having a standing army, but one that directly consumes 20% of the national budget and indirectly closer to 40%, with a budget that's larger than the next 13 countries COMBINED.\n\nwhat does the 2nd amendment mean in 2013 now that we ban citizens from being an effective militia, and we use the 2nd amendment to fight against the governments of large urban cities? i dunno.

I'm tired of hearing generalized policy rationale- I want to know specifically what the intended effect is and why.  There exists a huge gray area between regulated and unregulated.

As such, they tend to have more extreme positions.  I don't agree with them on a lot of issues, and frankly, they tend to put their foot in their mouth on a routine basis- don't get me started on armed security guards at elementary schools.\n\nWhat I'm opposed to in general is the government imposing additional regulation without a sufficient justification.  Instead they throw some platitudes our way like \"to protect children\" or to \"make us more secure.\"  The idea with cars is: let's say you take guns out of the equation entirely.  How would you feel if the government proposed that legislation?  Would it save more lives?  Perhaps.  But what are you giving up?  The ability to do something that's already illegal?  People who drive, which is almost everyone, would get into a huge uproar.  It's an example of the government trying to overstep its bounds, which is just how I feel with the gun control debate.\n\nAlso, on a personal note, I've heard the \"a gun is the same thing as a kitchen knife\" argument from a lot of pro-gun people.  I've had that debate with my own community, and I think it's asinine.  A gun is designed to kill things.  It's a weapon.  But again, I'm not making that comparison.\n\nThe problem I've had with everyone on this thread arguing with me is that they don't see the nuance in what I'm saying.  To put it into a sentence: if your only justification for additional gun control is that \"if it saves one life, it's worth it\" then you should apply that same logic to other aspects of public policy.  Keep in mind that SOPA and other onerous bills are also being put into place \"to protect you\" as well.

They can't see the whole distinction between primary usage and intent (guns and cars are both different forms of metal, guns don't kill people people do), they believe they have an almost unlimited right to them (i think that this was the post where someone said that \"cars are simply a privilege, 2A is a right!\"), and i could go on but its late.\n\nyou don't have to attempt to counter my points, as you don't believe them personally.  and in that respect you're just like me.\n\nyou say that almost all of the gun owners you know support background checks for initial purchases? i would suspect this is the case, because polls consistently show that ~90% of the American people do.  Problem is that the group that honest, law abiding gun owners let speak on their behalf says this:\n\n\"NRA opposes, and will continue to oppose, universal background checks\"  (http://www.nraila.org/news-issues/issues/background-checks.aspx)\n\ntop leaders of the Republican Party put out email blasts like this:\n\nhttp://pageonekentucky.com/2013/01/21/the-mitch-mcconnell-reinvention-tour-continues/\n\nadditional gun control is a reasonable-sounding solution that exists only in the vacuum of the inability to agree upon and implement reasonable solutions.  You're right that its dubious at best statistically speaking, but if you're not going to make the common-sense steps, get 'em off the streets.

I'm tired of hearing generalized policy rationale- I want to know specifically what the intended effect is and why.  There exists a huge gray area between regulated and unregulated.  I'm arguing that some is certainly good while excessive regulation infringes upon peoples' rights and freedoms.  \n\nPer the NRA- they're the most vocal counterweight to the gun control activists.  As such, they tend to have more extreme positions.  I don't agree with them on a lot of issues, and frankly, they tend to put their foot in their mouth on a routine basis- don't get me started on armed security guards at elementary schools.\n\nWhat I'm opposed to in general is the government imposing additional regulation without a sufficient justification.  Instead they throw some platitudes our way like \"to protect children\" or to \"make us more secure.\"  The idea with cars is: let's say you take guns out of the equation entirely.  How would you feel if the government proposed that legislation?  Would it save more lives?  Perhaps.  But what are you giving up?  The ability to do something that's already illegal?  People who drive, which is almost everyone, would get into a huge uproar.  It's an example of the government trying to overstep its bounds, which is just how I feel with the gun control debate.\n\nAlso, on a personal note, I've heard the \"a gun is the same thing as a kitchen knife\" argument from a lot of pro-gun people.  I've had that debate with my own community, and I think it's asinine.  A gun is designed to kill things.  It's a weapon.  But again, I'm not making that comparison.\n\nThe problem I've had with everyone on this thread arguing with me is that they don't see the nuance in what I'm saying.  To put it into a sentence: if your only justification for additional gun control is that \"if it saves one life, it's worth it\" then you should apply that same logic to other aspects of public policy.  Keep in mind that SOPA and other onerous bills are also being put into place \"to protect you\" as well.  Why is your privacy so important when giving it up could possibly catch criminals and stop terrorists?  Many 2A supporters don't trust the government's motives in asking for all these types of restrictions (which is also strange seeing as how a lot of them loved post 9/11 laws).", "edited": 1362037109, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8n4sid", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1362036490", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "id": "t1_c8n4get", "parent_id": "t1_c8n03t9", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431435758, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1362034919, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8n4get", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1362034735", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "lurking47", "id": "t1_c8n03t9", "parent_id": "t1_c8ldby5", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431433560, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Not sure if you've been reading any of my responses on here, but I have no idea where you got the \"inanimate metal chunk\" nonsense.  Also, not sure where you got \"unrestricted rights.\"  The amusing part is that everyone on this thread who's taken the required public speaking core class in college loves to throw around definitions of logical fallacies.  Your entire post uses the strawman technique to label my argument as such.  If there's a definition of irony, then you've just hit it right on the button.  Now to respond to your points:\n\n1.  I never said metal of equal mass (which again, you just made up).  I compared them as both potentially dangerous devices that can hurt people.  Obviously (see my original edit at the very top) guns are designed to kill things while cars aren't.  However, the purpose of regulation is to make the population safer isn't it? \n\n2.  Who said that there should be unrestricted access to guns?  The 2nd Amendment doesn't guarantee that, and almost all gun owners I know (and believe me, I'm well connected in that world) support at least basic controls such as background checks for an initial purchase.  Also, nobody is really disagreeing about the additional licenses required for suppressors or automatic weapons.\n\n3.  Oh really?  I just showed you a statistic which proves that lots of people speed, and lots of people die from speeding.  What I proposed is easy to implement on the ECU (there already is a governor on your car set to fuel cut at a high rate of speed).  So, (to paraphrase the support of the new gun control laws argument) \"why should you be allowed to ever drive over the speed limit?\"\n\nPer license restrictions, sure, I agree.  I support basic access to guns, followed by increased access with more training (and a tiered license system nationwide).  But, let's look at what's happening to me.  I'm highly trained- moreso than a vast majority of military/LEO in pistols/rifles.  But now I have legislators saying that in NY, for example, I can't have more than 7 rounds in my gun.  And on top of that, I know it's not going to reduce crime a single bit.  So what's the point? \n\nThe thing you're missing here is:  I'm not arguing against regulation.  I'm arguing that this additional gun control regulation is utterly unsupportable and ridiculous.  And many people who support it don't know anything about guns (except some cops- and why wouldn't they want the additional power).  Now the gun owners are angry, so I'm trying to get non gun owners to understand the frustration with a very similar proposal that everyone can relate to.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18wvsd", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8n03t9", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1362020218", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "id": "t1_c8ldby5", "parent_id": "t3_18wvsd", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431405238, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8ldby5", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361808374", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}

The same way we regulate Percocets to ensure public good, we have to make sure we're doing the same with guns.    \n\nif we wanted to end with inane hypothetical questions, i'm sure i can count on your support for repealing the laws infringing Americans rights to own guns, right? there's a lot of felons out there with their rights being infringed right at this very moment.....", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_18xiy7", "selftext": "&gt;where in the 2nd amendment does the word \"inconvienence\" come up?\n\nShall not be infringed.\n\n&gt;Courts (including Miller, Heller, and McDonald) continue to uphold the government's ability to restrict and regulate guns without running afoul of the 2nd amendment.\n\nThey also struck down handgun trigger locks^1 and such because laws that do not have a direct legitimate government concern in scope and effect are measured against the right to keep and bear arms with something-that-may-be-eventually-strict-scrutiny-but-right-now-is-in-a-weird-place.

So to keep toeing the party line, more moderate republicans are now getting grouped in with the TEA party folks.      \n\nthe answer is that they believe it's the right decision.  Economic considerations are consistently cloaked in American ideals, like a sweet coating allows you to swallow a bitter pill.  Thats why the wealthy are rebranded as \"job creators,\" for example.  \n\nIt also explains the appeal of guys like Paul Ryan.  Rolled up sleeves on a plaid shirt, does his workouts every day, not from the elitist east or west coast, just like you or me.  A real populist fellow.  But he's also the economic brain of the Republican party.  He's a persona selling a set of policies that in practice don't match his persona.     \n\nSo these policies that do what you say they do are seen as the right decision, but it has nothing to do with economics.  The policies are framed as a \"state's rights\" issue or a \"freedom\" or \"self-determination\" issue and sold that way.  speaking only a *little bit* speculatively, i'd say that if you're smart enough to understand how this works, you're either already against that particular policy or set of policies or you're complacent in it.\n\nalso, it's not really a \"sophisticated propaganda campaign.\" Conservative ideals and corporate interests naturally line up in a lot of ways (both favor small, toothless government, minimal working class consciousness, et. al.) so for as long as you can hide the consequences it doesn't really have to be much of a campaign nor really very sophisticated.\n\nTL:DR Since economic policies are always wrapped in American ideals, they're rarely pieced apart and therefore the \"right decision,\" though not for economic reasons.

Its convenient for some to limit its definition to \"federal income tax\" because as AuditorTux points out, a lot of people get credits and deductions that allow them to pay nothing in federal income tax.  this (of course) misses a whole plethora of \"other\" taxes, such as state and local taxes, and all kinds of excise taxes which are generally considered  \"taxes.\"\n\n1. not only do the \"other\" taxes exist, but they're not paid proportionately to income at all.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Taking a step back, its helpful to look at the political spectrum in terms of answering the question \"what role should the government have in my life?\" \n\nin pretty large terms, liberalism is (in part) the philosophy that the government has an important role to play in the lives of the citizenry. Liberals tend to trust the government more, and therefore allow the government more of its money and more of its power and think of it as a natural, normal state of affairs.  With its unique ability to enact laws that all must follow, the government has an obligation to do things of value for the entirety of its constituency, such as provide healthcare, useful education, protection against domestic and foreign invaders, etc.  Noone's saying that the stuff that gets done will be perfect, but its flaws shouldn't condemn it not to be done.\n\nConservatism, on the other hand, is its polar opposite.  the philosophy is that \"the government which governs the least governs the best.\"  They centrally believe the the government is not to be trusted, that the government is wasteful and inefficient, and threatens their rights.  they also fundamentally believe that government does the best job representing the people the closer the policy is made to the actual people (ie. state laws are better than federal ones).  Therefore, giving money and rights to the government should be minimized as much as possible, regardless of cost.  Conservatism also holds that people should take care of themselves, not the government, not only because the government does a bad job at it, but because we as Americans enshrine this value of individualism. \n\n\nliberalism = government is good, collective good, costs are worth it.\n\nconservatism = government is bad, individual rights, states rights, costs aren't worth it.\n\nnow, of course everyone will pile on me for this one, because it's really quite an oversimplified answer and there's far more nuance to it than that.  but this is ask_politics, and as long as we're honest with ourselves and stick to the stuff in the blue box on the right of our text, we can hash it out and give it more clarity.", "id": "t1_c8agjjm", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c8aku4o", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "is that even true empirically? that conservatives support the patriot act more than liberals? i don't think anyone really supports the patriot act, just some tolerate it better than others.

The business community is increasingly looking at higher education degree as the new litmus test for a candidate the same way a high school diploma used to be looked at.  To employers, higher education is a new prerequisite for positions that provide gainful employment and most importantly a toehold into the middle class.  In the face of this, students who traditionally wouldn't need a bachelors degree stare into an increasingly tougher job market with fewer prospects for those without a higher education.\n\nnow, of course someone will have a story, or know some guy at work, or whos brother-in-law was the exception to this rule.  it's to be expected, but that's what those stories are, exceptions. \n\nso it's certainly misleading to think of the problem as just \"top-down\" where the increased demand for higher education (and in large part its rising cost) and more expensive forms of it comes from the easy availability of money, and think of the problem as \"bottom-up\" where demand from employers make college the best choice for an increasingly large number of high school graduates, pushing demand (and in large part cost) up, for college in general, and quality (or perceived quality) specifically.\n\nthink about what the people that say its a \"top-down\" problem are actually saying.  they're actually saying something along the lines of: \n\n\"people spend years, thousands of hours, take out many thousands of dollars worth of debt to go to the best (or perceived best) college they can because the money is there.\"\n\nbecause that's the corollary of \"A huge reason for why education is astronomically expensive is because \"student aid\" is guaranteed money so there is no incentive to lower price and every incentive to raise it. &lt;--courtesy of SimpleManSC.  \n\nThis argument states that if the money wasn't \"guaranteed\" then poor people would stop going because they can't afford it, the lavish perks that colleges offer to woo students (the reason colleges are so expensive) would disappear for middle income borrowers, and rich people would just pay cash.

One side says that well... i'd have to guess that they'd say... people wake up one day or take or maybe take a week and do some research, and decide they want to be gay.  the other side of the debate says its not a choice, that its genetic, or envionmental, or some combination of the two. or maybe something else. but not a choice.\n\nits a convenient idea for the anti-gay folk because you're not denying gays and lesbians anything, they chose to be gay. \n\nif they choose to be gay, that's on them, and although its a (bad/unpopular/unwise/immoral/heretical/?) choice, we as a society is not \"obligated\" to change anything because of your (bad/unpopular/unwise/immoral/heretical/?) choice. \n\n\n\n++TL:DR AuditorTux's argument is predicated on the fact that being gay in life is a conscious choice one makes, which isn't universally accepted as fact.

The only difference between a straight man and a gay man is whom they are attracted to.  Under the law, they are both allowed to marry under the same circumstances.  It is simply that the gay man's preferences do not align with those circumstances.\n\nYou can argue whether it is a choice or not, but it is always a choose to act upon the desire to commit yourself to one person.  Now, if you want to say that it is not a choice but somehow heaven opens and reveals that this is your soulmate... I can go with that.  But be prepared for all sorts of ill-logic to follow as I cannot, nor can anyone, determine if heaven really opened up or whether you are lying.\n\nMarriage has always been a decision that must be made willingly and sworn to upon obtaining the license to actually marry.  It does not matter whether society as a whole agrees with it or not - are you somehow wanting to argue that a gay man does not have the same rights that a straight man has?  Can a straight man, by virtue of being straight, marry another man?  No.  He is also limited.\n\nNow, I agree that we should allow any two (or more) people to marry.  But to say that it is somehow limit a gay man's right is to really parse the ideas and situation to a point that it is unrecognizable.

It used to (and still does) prepare us well for the low-tech and low skill labor market that used to exist (think like sheetmetal stamper or blacksmith or something like that) \n\nthings have changed the labor market has become information and service based, and our K-12 system is falling behind in preparing the kids for those jobs.  that task has fallen upon colleges (and trade schools and tech schools). So now we push the kids into college en masse, as its becoming increasingly necessary.\n\n2. We, as Americans, believe in this idea of equality of opportunity.  everyone has a fair shot at the American Dream, coming from a log cabin to the presidency, etc.   The way the people chose to do this is by funding the colleges either directly by the states as with land-grant colleges (as in my Alma Mater) and/or making available lots of student loans (some the ol' free market type, some with the interest subsidized by the government) and also grants and scholarships (some merit-based, some need-based) so that everybody gets a shot at college (because now everyone needs a shot to be competitive)  \n\n3. Just like with the housing market, lots of easy money and cheap money leads to overspending.  When money is less of a factor, students want to go to the best school they can.  To better attract students, colleges put up bigger buildings, increase amenities, hire world-class teachers,  spend big on athletics programs (go Huskies!), etc. and the money has to come from somewhere, namely higher tuition.\n\nyou see? we're using the system in a way it wasn't designed to be used, and we're paying the price for it.\n\nhow to fix it? there's ways.  you can cut all of the financial aid out.\nbut that risks leaving us with only a tenuous hold on one of our fundamental beliefs, that if you work hard enough and study hard enough, you can get into a good school, and there will be a way to pay for it, regardless of who you are or where you came from.\n\nyou can add private for-profit colleges into the mix. In theory, they offer students better value than the bloated public college system, along with things like online classes and night and weekend classes.  However, these schools have found a nice little niche to making money.  they promise you unrealistic things upfront, get you to take out a bunch of loans, pay their own bills out of the money, then keep the rest as profit.  they get paid, so they dont care if you ever show up for class, and if the gravy train ever stops, close the school.\n\n+personal note here, not factually based+ \n\nthe answer (to me) is fix the K-12 system.  i don't see how we will, as we need a couple of things.\n\n1. to recognize we have a problem first as a country.  far too many of us think we're still \"#1 in the world, cuz we're 'mercuns\"\n\n2. gain the political will. its going to take cooperation from the states (as K-12 education is a VERY local and closely guarded kind of thing and should stay that way) and the will to spend some money on it.

Then, because... well i don't know... electric and hybrid car owners would be hit with another $100 yearly tax.\n\nalso, the $100 is probably right on point in terms of cost.  as inhabitat.com reports, The state gas tax in Washington is 37.5 cents per gallon, which over 12,000 miles per year racks up an average bill of $204 in state gas taxes for a conventional gas powered vehicle.  Now, electric car drivers probably don't drive the full 12K per year, so they're likely underpaying by a small margin if any at all.\n\n \nto your point, as the ratio of electric cars to gasoline powered cars fluctuates, the tax can keep up.  the gas tax doesn't have to be scrapped.  when you take your car in for emissions, or yearly inspection, they read your odometer and write it down, or take it right off the OBDII port. now you can be taxed appropriately to keep the roads maintained.

This is pure fallacy. Money (and tax money) is fungible. Taxes pay government, government pays for roads (and other things). How much it pays for roads is a decision of government and independent of what is received in gas taxes (aside from perhaps gas tax receipts setting some minimum funding level).\n\nSo apparently there's a revenue shortfall in VA, which might be due to falling gas tax revenue but could be due to many other things as well. So revenue needs to be raised somehow, and responsible ways to do it should be pursued.\n\nThe part about raising sales tax makes sense. There certainly might be better ways, as sales tax is a penalty for commerce, and is a regressive tax, but all the same it's a common and effective way for states to raise revenue. As far as \"why would you tax everyone even if they don't drive?\", again you need to realize money is fungible. Government already taxes everyone to do everything it does, including paying for roads.\n\nBesides, I could point out that investing in infrastructure helps the economy / society in general even if some people don't use it directly. This is why we have public roads in the first place. If we believe that only people who drive should pay for roads then we would have no *public* roads - everything would be a toll road.\n\nThe part about eliminating the gas tax makes no sense. If you need to raise revenue why would you eliminate any tax? Further, the gas tax is an excise tax that makes perfect sense, as it gives people an incentive to use less gas, which is pretty much universally accepted to be a good thing. The gas tax should be raised, if anything. I'd surmise that the only way to explain this proposal is to look at how much in campaign contributions this guy (or his party) has received from oil companies.\n\nThe part about a fee on hybrids and electric cars also makes no sense. Like the gas tax, this is an excise tax. Like any excise tax, this discourages consumption. While we want to discourage gas consumption, we don't want to discourage people from buying more efficient cars. In fact we want to do (and are doing) the exact opposite. Virginia, like most other states and the federal government, offers various incentives aimed at encouraging people to buy electric cars, including HOV lane access and a property tax reduction. Why would you use tax code to encourage something in one instance then discourage the same thing in another instance?\n\nAlso, the number of hybrids and (especially) electric vehicles is small, so this fee will do very little to address the revenue shortfall. And if you're really hung up on the idea that all cars should pay some sort of \"road tax\", then you should propose a new tax that does exactly that. I.e. *all* cars and trucks pay a tax based on weight and miles driven.\n\nTL;DR No, I can't explain it aside from the sales tax part. The best explanation is probably just to point out that the guy is a Republican.", "edited": 1359186543, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c83hdfq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1359138957", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "clicked": false, "title": "Can someone explain Bob McDonnel's plan to eliminate the gas tax and charge electric car owners yearly?", "media": null, "base10id": 72449058, "id": "t3_174u1u", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 1, "saved": false, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/Ask_Politics/comments/174u1u/can_someone_explain_bob_mcdonnels_plan_to/", "name": "t3_174u1u", "created": 1358964508, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/174u1u/can_someone_explain_bob_mcdonnels_plan_to/", "author_flair_text": null, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "created_utc": 1358964508, "distinguished": null, "num_comments": 7, "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}

You presented this not as your own mechanism for deliberation, but as that a court would use to define whether a weapon is protected under the 2A. These are very different propositions. \n\n2. Have you read Miller? It was about sawn off shotguns. It has nothing *at all* to do with muskets. Second, the entirity of Miller does not stand, meaning it's deliberations and reasonings do not affect the current interpretation of the 2A. To quote Heller in this regard:\n&gt;Miller stands only for the proposition that the Second Amendment right, whatever its nature, extends only to certain types of weapons. It is particularly wrongheaded to read Miller for more than what it said, because the case did not even purport to be a thorough examination of the Second Amendment.\n\nFurther, specifically Heller states that the standard in Miller is:\n&gt;We think that Miller\u2019s \u201cordinary military equipment\u201d language must be read in tandem with what comes after: \u201c[O]rdinarily when called for [militia] service [able-bodied] men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.\u201d 307 U. S., at 179. The traditional militia was formed from a pool of men bringing arms \u201cin common use at the time\u201d for lawful purposes like self-defense. \u201cIn the colonial and revolu\u00ad tionary war era, [small-arms] weapons used by militiamen and weapons used in defense of person and home were one and the same.\u201d \n\nLimiting that definition to any period of time like you are, saying that it was saying that weapons other than muskets, or those available in 1939 (which includes most gun designs), denies the fact that the Militia may be called again today with those same requirements. It can be so called, and the expectations for any militia called today are the same as in the reading from Heller above. That they come with weapons in \"common use for lawful purposes\" today. \n\nThe only purpose of the 2A in the Miller decision, then, is to protect the unorganized militia by ensuring they have guns. Stating that this is limited to weapons either from 1776 or 1939 completely obviates this stated purpose, according to Miller.\n\nTo state that your interpretation of Miller is what applies also has to ignore the actual case ruling in Heller that a weapon in common use for lawful purposes in 2008 was protected by the 2A, regardless of availability in 1776 or 1939.\n\nThe AR-15 and other \"assault weapons\" very clearly fall into the definition of weapons protected by the 2A given in Heller.\n", "id": "t1_c81rlw9", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "yes, i will agree with you that Heller states that \"that a weapon in common use for lawful purposes in 2008 was protected by the 2nd amendment\"\n\nim simply stating that up until a certain point, there was little to no difference between the arms a militia-man would show up with if he were called into duty and what he used \"for lawful purposes like self defense\" (and i think you would agree we could add hunting for subsistence or for sport, protecting a domicile and its occupants, and sport shooting as lawful purposes)\n\nand your quote says the same thing:  \"The traditional militia was formed from a pool of men bringing arms \u201cin common use at the time\u201d for lawful purposes like self-defense. \u201cIn the colonial and revolu\u00adtionary war era, [small-arms] weapons used by militiamen and weapons used in defense of person and home were one and the same.\u201d \n\nso its not hard to see we're on the same page.\n\nnow, you have to set out some basic criteria for what constitutes \"in common use at the time\" if the time you're speaking about is 2013.  \n\nIn theory, you could argue that if one (1) person only one (1) time uses an AR-15 for any lawful purpose at all, then that fulfills the requirement of \"in common use at the time.\"  then, even though that one person may use a 1911 on his hip for personal protection and on his nightstand for domicile/family protection, and a shotgun for hunting, the AR-15 is a weapon that can be considered \"in common use.\" However, that's quite untenable, and isn't in keeping with the spirit of the word \"common.\" \n\nthe other theoretical end of the spectrum is that an AR-15  is owned and used almost universally, something like 98% of gun owners have one and use it exclusively or almost exclusively for the \"lawful purposes\" described above.

Now where I feel you and I will disagree is on the last part, we all know that all guns are dangerous, but it is a measure of degrees that will depend on the person viewing. So these guns (with pistol grips, flash suppressors, heat shields, and pistol grips) are all  features of guns that are in common use (and have been Historicaly used since ww1) they do not increase the lethality, so in my opinion are not and do not make a gun any more dangerous, and are not unusual in any way. \n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c80ycnv", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1358794212", "ups": 5, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_16zpuz", "selftext": "The only restrictions mentioned in Heller are for certain individuals (felons, mentally ill, etc), and on \"dangerous or unusual\" weapons. Those are referenced to the previous Miller decision.\n\nAlso, it says \"lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home\". This means it's not to protect the home, but rather the occupant. That is quite different than protecting a building.\n\nLike you said, extrapolate at your own risk here. However, it doesn't define who it's dangerous for. One can reason that it must not mean dangerous to the attacker, as we're talking about lethal self-defense here. It's supposed to kill that guy. Logically, this must mean dangerous to the person firing the weapon, or to the public in general. This is generally a prohibition on things like using suicide vests for self defense. \n\nHowever, it's the Miller decision that is so important here. The reason that Heller ruled that a ban on handguns is unconstitutional is that they are in \"common use\". The same is true for an AR15, which is hailed as the \"modern musket\", and also has a remarkable safety record.\n\nAny sporting uses are also covered. Self defense is listed as a specification of \"lawful use\", not a restriction on it. Using guns in sporting events is lawful, and their use is as such protected by the second amendment. \n\nThere is no \"reasonable person\" test for the 2nd amendment. Heller states only the \"dangerous or unusual\" tests.\n\nTo you personally, I suggest reading Jeff Cooper's book on self defense. He ran security forces in mogadishu, and had far too many opportunities to use them. The techniques he developed are \"scary\" to most gun control advocates, but they have saved countless lives. His techniques are the basis of nearly all armed self defense, and is used not only by citizens, but by police forces around the world. \n\nThe reason I suggest this is that you seem to feel that a self defense weapon should not be \"efficent\", and that features that ban it's effectiveness should be banned. This makes no sense in any defense situation. Being under-armed is, frankly, suicide in that situation. This is the fact so well detailed in Cooper's writings. \n\nIt stands to follow that any restriction on a self defense weapon that decrease it's efficency is no different than a restriction on self defense itself. Killing efficently is the only thing that will save your life. As hard as it is to swallow for some, the right to self defense is a right to kill, and it is about killing, and always has been.\n\n\n", "id": "t1_c81lx4b", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "off into the weeds we go.  \n\n1. i used a \"reasonable person\" test because legally speaking, its a great way to inject objectivity into the debate.

We're back to the miller argument.  Miller looked back into history and found that guns in \"common use\" during the time were muskets.  and they were right. and what kind of weapons did Miller think needed protection? weapons in common use at the time.  and that's right.  Problem was, that musket in 1776 was privately owned, and expected to be put into militia service if need be. it was what the citizen/soldier would use for the primary purposes of the Second Amendment, personal protection, hunting for sustenance, property protection, national defense, and shooting sports (which im sure existed back then, dick swinging competitions are almost as old as humans themselves).  So in that respect, the militia weapon and the weapon in \"common use\" at the time was the same thing.  So it all made sense.  Right around WW1, however,  the precursors to what we would call \"assault rifles\" came along.  this is where we find the divergence.  assault rifles became specialized for use in war (smaller, larger ammo capacity, aforementioned accessories for the purposes described in the brady explanation *but not necessarily limited to war*) with armies around the world being the primary market for these weapons.  Technological advances in rifles, shotguns, and pistols made them better weapons for hunting, self defense, domicile defense, and shooting sports (although shooting sports are a grey area, you could argue that assault rifles make for more fun target practice than a musket).  As assault weapons became more specialized, and advances in technology to pistols, shotguns, and rifles tailored them to what people were using them for, your ability to say that an AR-15 is in \"common use\" today the same way it was when the supreme court wrote those decisions finds little historical backing.  Miller was written in 1939, looking back at the period of 1650-1938, whereas the AR-15 didn't even come into military service until 1958.    \n\nFast forward to today, and lets think about the modern corollary to the gun situation in 1776. Find a random 100 gun owners, and tell them that the Mexicans are coming for them, grab their trusty weapon and meet in the center square. How many assault rifles do you think you're gonna find?    \n\n\n", "id": "t1_c81opmz", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_16zpuz", "selftext": "1. You presented this not as your own mechanism for deliberation, but as that a court would use to define whether a weapon is protected under the 2A. These are very different propositions. \n\n2. Have you read Miller? It was about sawn off shotguns. It has nothing *at all* to do with muskets. Second, the entirity of Miller does not stand, meaning it's deliberations and reasonings do not affect the current interpretation of the 2A. To quote Heller in this regard:\n&gt;Miller stands only for the proposition that the Second Amendment right, whatever its nature, extends only to certain types of weapons. It is particularly wrongheaded to read Miller for more than what it said, because the case did not even purport to be a thorough examination of the Second Amendment.\n\nFurther, specifically Heller states that the standard in Miller is:\n&gt;We think that Miller\u2019s \u201cordinary military equipment\u201d language must be read in tandem with what comes after: \u201c[O]rdinarily when called for [militia] service [able-bodied] men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.\u201d 307 U. S., at 179. The traditional militia was formed from a pool of men bringing arms \u201cin common use at the time\u201d for lawful purposes like self-defense. \u201cIn the colonial and revolu\u00ad tionary war era, [small-arms] weapons used by militiamen and weapons used in defense of person and home were one and the same.\u201d \n\nLimiting that definition to any period of time like you are, saying that it was saying that weapons other than muskets, or those available in 1939 (which includes most gun designs), denies the fact that the Militia may be called again today with those same requirements. It can be so called, and the expectations for any militia called today are the same as in the reading from Heller above. That they come with weapons in \"common use for lawful purposes\" today. \n\nThe only purpose of the 2A in the Miller decision, then, is to protect the unorganized militia by ensuring they have guns. Stating that this is limited to weapons either from 1776 or 1939 completely obviates this stated purpose, according to Miller.\n\nTo state that your interpretation of Miller is what applies also has to ignore the actual case ruling in Heller that a weapon in common use for lawful purposes in 2008 was protected by the 2A, regardless of availability in 1776 or 1939.\n\nThe AR-15 and other \"assault weapons\" very clearly fall into the definition of weapons protected by the 2A given in Heller.\n", "id": "t1_c81rlw9", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "yes, i will agree with you that Heller states that \"that a weapon in common use for lawful purposes in 2008 was protected by the 2nd amendment\"\n\nim simply stating that up until a certain point, there was little to no difference between the arms a militia-man would show up with if he were called into duty and what he used \"for lawful purposes like self defense\" (and i think you would agree we could add hunting for subsistence or for sport, protecting a domicile and its occupants, and sport shooting as lawful purposes)\n\nand your quote says the same thing:  \"The traditional militia was formed from a pool of men bringing arms \u201cin common use at the time\u201d for lawful purposes like self-defense. \u201cIn the colonial and revolu\u00adtionary war era, [small-arms] weapons used by militiamen and weapons used in defense of person and home were one and the same.\u201d \n\nso its not hard to see we're on the same page.\n\nnow, you have to set out some basic criteria for what constitutes \"in common use at the time\" if the time you're speaking about is 2013.  \n\nIn theory, you could argue that if one (1) person only one (1) time uses an AR-15 for any lawful purpose at all, then that fulfills the requirement of \"in common use at the time.\"  then, even though that one person may use a 1911 on his hip for personal protection and on his nightstand for domicile/family protection, and a shotgun for hunting, the AR-15 is a weapon that can be considered \"in common use.\" However, that's quite untenable, and isn't in keeping with the spirit of the word \"common.\" \n\nthe other theoretical end of the spectrum is that an AR-15  is owned and used almost universally, something like 98% of gun owners have one and use it exclusively or almost exclusively for the \"lawful purposes\" described above.  However, that's theoretically untenable also. AR-15s were born and bred from combat, consistently tinkered with and improved to do a better job at killing \"enemy combatants\" in order to offer better value and efficacy to militaries around the world.  The kinds of things that make it great for killing people also put it at a disadvantage (though not excluding it) for \"lawful purposes\" such as its size and weight, the barrel's tendency to get hot after firing repeated rounds, in some cases bullet cost, etc. \n\nso, as neither of those ends of the spectrum really address the question, you do as they did in both Heller and Miller and you go back to the history for insight.  \n\nRemember, you're looking back into history for insight to see if an AR-15 can be considered \"in common use for lawful purposes.\" Miller and Heller say that small arms are protected because in history (and still today) those weapons were \"used in defense of person and home were one and the same.\u201d  so if an AR-15 can be counted as protected using Miller and Heller's argument, history should show that historically, the AR-15 meets the same kind of requirements.     \n\nMiller and Heller looked back into history and found that guns in \"common use\" during the time were muskets. and they were right. and what kind of weapons did Miller and Heller rightfully declare warranted constitutional protection? weapons in common use at the time. and that's right. Problem was, that musket in 1776 was privately owned, and expected to be put into militia service if need be. it was what the citizen/soldier would use for the primary purposes of the Second Amendment, personal protection, hunting for sustenance, property protection, national defense, and shooting sports (which im sure existed back then, dick swinging competitions are almost as old as humans themselves).

Ultimately a judge will have to answer what \"in common use\" means.\n\nhowever, as an aside, if \"assault weapons\" (not assault rifles) are no more powerful than a hunting rifle, no more deadly than one, and their accessories don't make them any more lethal, and they're bad choices for criminals anyways (the statistics say that they're involved in a miniscule number of gun related deaths every year) does that make their owners the rough equivalent of the douchebags that buy hummers and put chrome bits on them and never take them off-road? or civics with fart-can exhausts?  It just seems wasteful to me.  just buy a damn hunting rifle.\n\ndo they buy them because they look cool? because they want to look tough or \"gangsta\"? because they want to relive their military days?  maybe it's about \"expressing your 2nd amendment right\" to the fullest?\n\nas someone who's ambivalent to the whole thing, please explain.
