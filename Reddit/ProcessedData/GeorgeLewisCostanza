{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1nxkut", "selftext": "To review, it's important to understand what the debt and deficit is, and the difference between the two.\n\nEvery year, the government takes in money (mostly through taxes), and spends money on various government programs.  Let's say that in 2012, the government took in $1 trillion in taxes, but spent $2 trillion in government spending.  Since the government spent more ($2 trillion) then it took in ($1 trillion), there is now a $1 trillion shortfall, which is called a deficit.  If, instead, the government took in $2 trillion in taxes and only spent $1 trillion, then they would have more money then they needed.  This is called a surplus.\n\nIf the government spends $2 trillion, but has only collected $1 trillion (as collected from taxes), then they need to borrow the remaining $1 trillion.  As a result, the government borrows a certain amount every year.  The debt is the total amount that has been borrowed.\n\nThink of it like your personal credit card.  You have a balance, that you try to keep at $0.  If you use it to purchase goods, you start increasing your balance, and increasing your debt.  You try to pay it off as often as you can, but if you continue to spend more than you pay off, then your balance will keep going up.\n\nThe same thing is happening to the debt.  The government continues to run a deficit, and therefore keeps accruing more debt every year.\n\nTo get to you original question, the shutdown does not affect the deficit or the debt.  The shutdown essentially stops all payments temporarily, but Congress will likely still end up spending that amount once the government reopens.  The Congressional Budget Office calculates the deficit and debt (I think) every quarter, and certainly by the end of the fiscal year, so they will track all of the revenues and expenditures that the government makes this year.\n\nThe major point on the affects on the deficit will be in regards to the sequester.  If they keep the sequester funding in place (that Republicans support), then the deficit will be smaller.\n\nTL;DR: No, the shutdown does not affect the deficit, since the government will still spend the same amount this year as they would have without a shutdown.", "id": "t1_ccnb97l", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "GeorgeLewisCostanza", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1nxkut", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1429206455, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ccnb97l", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1381210653", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}

The sheer number of people contained in the small space did the damage, even though the majority of tne group was peaceful. There was a request to help fund the repair effort publicly, and a call for volunteers to help restore the Mall. The result: barely anyone showed up and Congress passed special funding to fix the problems. Sorry, this is a personal anecdote,.so I don't have a source immediately to back it up. The truth is that we expect the government to maintain our national landmarks, because they don't belong to a single group or person. We want them to be accessible to every citizen and visitor that wants to learn from and experience them. The logistics of maintaining the parks and monuments goes well beyond the means of local boy scout troop 259 and the local elks club. Many landmarks require specalized training for cleaning, and preservation.

Cruz conducted a \"filibuster,\" but I wanted to answer your question with a direct answer.\n\nThe Senate, as allowed by the Constitution in Article 1, Section 5, chooses their own rules of procedure.  The Senate operates under [Riddick's Senate Procedure](http://www.riddick.gpo.gov/).  The section of Riddick's Rules outlining quorum [states](http://www.riddick.gpoaccess.gov/UserData/SenateProcedures/Quorum.pdf#xml=http://www.riddick.gpo.gov/PdfHighlighter.aspx?DocId=111&amp;Index=D%3a\\WebSites\\UseIndex\\SenateProcedures\\&amp;HitCount=6&amp;hits=505+506+507+508+509+50a+) (page 1041) as follows:\n&gt; The Senate operates on the presumption that a quorum is present at all times, under all circumstances, unless the question to the contrary is raised, or the absence of a quorum is officially shown otherwise, or until a point of no quorum is made even though a voice vote is taken and announced in the meantime.\n\nThis means that the Senate continues to operate normally, unless a Senator makes a point that a quorum is not present, at which time the Senate clerk calls the roll to determine if a quorum is present (which is a majority, or 51 Senators).  For the Cruz speech (I'm not calling it a filibuster), there was not a quorum present; the Senate was operating under the \"presumption\" of a quorum, as allowed under this rule.\n\nTheoretically, yes, Senator Cruz could have been a dick and compelled a majority of Senators to show up.  In what's known as a \"live quorum,\" a Senator can say ahead of time that they are going to wait for a full quorum to arrive before proceeding.  If a quorum still does not arrive, there are steps the Senate can take to bring a quorum to the floor, usually by directing the Senate Sergeant at Arms to \"compel\" the attendance of absent Senators.  [In the past](http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Compulsory_Attendance.htm), the Senate has even directly the Sergeant at Arms and the Capitol Police to physically bring an absent Senator to the floor, as was with the case of Senator Bob Packwood (R-OR).\n\nSo yes, Senator Cruz could have gone through these steps to compel a quorum to be present.

The Senate rules are very different from the rules in the House. In the House, agreements are made ahead of time as to how long debate will go on for discussion on a bill. In the Senate, the rules dictate that debate is endless, and the only way to end debate is by \"unanimous consent.\"\n\nSenate rules requires unanimous consent (UC) for just about everything. It is essentially what it sounds like - all Senators need to give their consent to move forward. But as we have seen, this allows even one Senator to object, bringing the process to a halt.\n\nThis is why Senators don't actually need to go down onto the floor and talk continuously, a la Jimmy Stewart/Jefferson Smith. They simply have to object to moving forward. And, what's more, Senators don't even need to go from their office onto the floor of the Senate to do this. Nowadays, there is at least one Senator from each party who stays on the floor during the day (they take shifts).\n\nFor example, say Senator A wants to object to moving forward on a bill. The call up Senator B, who is sitting at their desk in the Senate chamber. Senator A tells Senator B that they object to moving forward on the bill. Senator B will then say, \"On behalf of my colleague, Senator A, I respectfully object.\" Bam, you got yourself a filibuster.\n\nWhat's more, the process laid out in the Senate rules to get around a filibuster is very time-consuming. In order to get around an objection, the rules say that at least 17 Senators have to file a \"cloture motion,\" or a petition to end debate. Once this motion is filed, you have to wait two legislative days. After those two days, they hold a vote on whether to end debate. This requires 60 votes, and is why you always hear that number with regards to filibusters. And then, even if it gets 60 votes, debate STILL continues for 30 MORE HOURS. After that time, debate has ended, and they move forward.
