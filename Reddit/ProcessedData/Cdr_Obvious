You don't learn how to make widgets at a class down at the community college. You learn to make widgets at the widget factory, where they start you as a trainee making a low wage and increase your pay as your productivity goes up.  \n\n&gt; why not buy machines that augment employees?\n\nBecause an employer doesn't exist to pay people as much as possible, or employ as many people as possible.  To the contrary. An employer (aside from the government I guess) exists to do something that people are willing to pay it to do, and to do that thing as cheaply and efficiently as possible.  And when you artificially jack up labor costs, folks shouldn't be surprised when employers figure out how to reduce labor costs.  \n\nObviously a highly automated factory still needs SOME employees.  But don't act surprised when they go from a 50 man shift to a 5 man shift.  \n\n&gt; I don't see a reason why you would have to hire fewer people\n\nThere's only so much demand for widgets.  And every employer worth it's salt meets 100% of that demand (or in a highly competitive market, whatever share it's able).  An employer (at least until Obamacare, I guess) doesn't set an artificial employee cap.  If an additional employee is profitable, he'll be hired.  \n\nMeaning that the employer is already making all the widgets it can sell.  It's going to keep making that # of widgets while spending less to do so if it can.  Further, there's the whole fact that you're talking about major expenditures - your suggestion that not only do I keep the same # of employees I now have to pay more money to, I also buy a bunch of expensive machines too, just isn't going to fly.   \n\n&gt;the Jevons Paradox\n\nWithout getting into a discussion of the validity of Jevons' assertion, I think you're missing the part that a minimum wage hike doesn't make labor (as a resource) more efficient.  To the contrary - if I pay John Doe $9 an hour today, and tomorrow I have to pay him $10.10 an hour, that's less efficient.  I'm paying more money to get the same return.

You don't learn how to make widgets at a class down at the community college. You learn to make widgets at the widget factory, where they start you as a trainee making a low wage and increase your pay as your productivity goes up.  \n\n&gt; why not buy machines that augment employees?\n\nBecause an employer doesn't exist to pay people as much as possible, or employ as many people as possible.  To the contrary. An employer (aside from the government I guess) exists to do something that people are willing to pay it to do, and to do that thing as cheaply and efficiently as possible.  And when you artificially jack up labor costs, folks shouldn't be surprised when employers figure out how to reduce labor costs.  \n\nObviously a highly automated factory still needs SOME employees.  But don't act surprised when they go from a 50 man shift to a 5 man shift.  \n\n&gt; I don't see a reason why you would have to hire fewer people\n\nThere's only so much demand for widgets.  And every employer worth it's salt meets 100% of that demand (or in a highly competitive market, whatever share it's able).  An employer (at least until Obamacare, I guess) doesn't set an artificial employee cap.  If an additional employee is profitable, he'll be hired.  \n\nMeaning that the employer is already making all the widgets it can sell.  It's going to keep making that # of widgets while spending less to do so if it can.  Further, there's the whole fact that you're talking about major expenditures - your suggestion that not only do I keep the same # of employees I now have to pay more money to, I also buy a bunch of expensive machines too, just isn't going to fly.   \n\n&gt;the Jevons Paradox\n\nWithout getting into a discussion of the validity of Jevons' assertion, I think you're missing the part that a minimum wage hike doesn't make labor (as a resource) more efficient.  To the contrary - if I pay John Doe $9 an hour today, and tomorrow I have to pay him $10.10 an hour, that's less efficient.  I'm paying more money to get the same return.

And they're also going to notice if a 25 year old is voting with an address at the old folks home around the corner, or voting a ballot saying he was born in 1922. \n\nOr is it easier to loop in exactly one person, pay them a bunch of money, and have them intercept the ballots on the day they come in, getting them to us so we can fill them in at our leisure over the course of 2+ weeks? Because really, how many nursing home tenants are going to notice a missing ballot?  \n\nAs to your refutations - is the wife who's psychologically damaged because her husband gets drunk and beats her 3 times a week going to turn him in?  Is the kid who doesn't give two shits about voting going to turn pops in?  \n\nAs to a nursing home - when we're stealing their votes, they never need to see the ballots.  We take them, vote the way we want them to, and send them in.  \n\nVoting a provisional doesn't cut it.  At best, that results in the illegal vote and the provo vote cancelling each other out.  scared her husband is going to hit her againIt can vary by state, but name, address, and generally birthdate are included.  Voter history certainly is - which can be a pretty good proxy for birthdate most often.  \n\nAs to other officials - I made this point earlier, but just in case you missed it.  The more people are involved, the better the check on the process.  When a polling place is staffed by 3 nominally nonpartisan polling workers, who are observed throughout the day by both the people voting and (often) party representatives on both sides, someone is going to notice if sketchiness happens.  \n\nWith mail voting, those checks simply aren't there.  \n\nIf you want to go ahead and live in a fantasy world where voter fraud doesn't occur, walking around money doesn't exist, and votes aren't bought and sold, then go ahead.  \n\nI live in the real world.  And in the real world, a state with 100% mail voting is BEGGING for rampant election fraud.  It's going to happen - it's just a matter of time.\n", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Cdr_Obvious", "id": "t1_cf2qvke", "parent_id": "t1_cf2cc6v", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1432175528, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1wfoc4", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cf2qvke", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1391097288", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "thedurka", "id": "t1_cf2cc6v", "parent_id": "t1_cf2b6vq", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1432168391, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Have you ever seen a voter roll? It is literally a list of names and nothing else. Anyone can walk into any polling station, and, as long as they know the name of a registered voter who hasn't voted yet, they could steal their vote. The rate at which this happens though, even without voter ID laws (which, although arguably good in theory, have loads and loads of problems and potential abuses which render them worse than useless), is mind-numbingly low. A voter in Florida, a state which led the nation in purging suspected illegal voters, is still more likely to be eaten by a shark than have their vote stolen. Of the more than 600,000,000 votes cast in national elections since 2000, there's been a whopping ***13*** confirmed cases of vote stealing. It simply isn't an issue.\n\nNow, as for the other scenarios you list -- the answer is honestly varied. For families, it wouldn't be a problem because a wife whose husband voted for her could simply call and void her ballot, and then cast a provisional ballot on election day. Similarly, someone at a nursing home who was in good enough mental condition to fill out a ballot, is also likely in good enough condition to notice if they didn't ever get one. I suppose some nurse could just throw a bunch of ballots away, but again, you're allowed to file a complaint and vote provisionally. As many of those in nursing homes couldn't get to a polling place anyways, there isn't much to do to stop that sort of fraud (which again, there's basically no evidence occurs in any significant way) that doesn't take their right to vote away.

There was major disagreement at the time about whether we even needed it; the assumption was no one in their right mind would think we WOULDN'T have the right to keep and bear arms.  Given that, the fear was that people would assume (as they've done) that rights that aren't explicitly laid out don't exist.  \n\nTo your points, one at a time-\n\n1. Why is it impractical? Game it out, and/or look at Afghanistan as a practical example of a woefully under-armed populace holding off a much stronger force (twice in recent decades).  Or think over what would happen. The US has a sizable rebellion occur.  A bunch of locals grab their AR's (which incidentally are trivially converted to full auto - which I imagine would happen in rebellion).  They'd take a base or two, somewhere, without shots fired, in part because you'd have enough military who are sympathetic.  And from there, they're not under-armed any more.\n\n2. Not 100% what you're getting at here, but given that self defense is pretty solidly enshrined in both US law and the English common law upon which our system is based, we have that right.  \n\n3. Fairly often; the issue with the pro-gun control crowd is that the statistics they use are biased against defensive gun uses that don't result in a dead bad guy.  Example: I have a 12 gauge shotgun in my bedroom.  If someone broke down my door, and I stood at the top of the stairs, racked my 12 gauge, and said, \"Do you feel lucky, punk?\", they're almost certainly going to turn and run (probably leaving a puddle behind).  Bloomberg/Brady/et al would not count that as a defensive gun use, because I didn't kill the guy.  \n\n4. Quite likely.  Not to mention the [disproportionate blame shifted to guns, as reported by Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-17/mass-shootings-fuel-fear-account-for-fraction-of-murders.html).

My issue with it is that individual property owners may value their property differently from the market price. Think of it this way. Let's say that the government decides to demolish my house for a project that they estimate will benefit the area by $1 million. Let's say that the market price for my property is $100,000. However, since *value is subjective*, I may, for whatever reason, personally value the land at, say, $2 million (that is to say, I believe I would be better off with the property than any amount of money under $2 million). I would never sell the property on the market in this case unless the price somehow rose that high, or how I value that property went down.\n\nSo the government comes in and gives you $100,000 dollars for the property, and dumps you. However, I still lose out because I lost $1.9 million in value. Now, if the government was right in its judgement, the \"greater good\" gains a net $900,000 in benefit from the project. But that's still a net loss of a million dollars. Now, if the project was projected to benefit the area by more than what the property owner values it, then the government could pay the price demanded by owner and still see a net gain. If the government has to force a person to sell, it is a sign that there is a net loss in value/benefit.\n\nThat, of course, is ignoring the government's propensity for miscalculating benefit. The city of Detroit, for example, has become infamous for using eminent domain for projects that end up failing completely to benefit the city at all.\n\nBottom line is, in a free market, absolutely *nobody* has the power to force you to buy or sell something at a fixed price. You always have the option to look somewhere else, or to just refuse to buy/sell.

Notice that I'm not talking about the raising of kids, but merely about the breeding part. Pro-life individuals believe, for a variety of reasons, that women should be made to be slaves to their biology.\n\nMaybe this pissed you off, but bear with me. What you're expressing is pure sentimentality. When we see the beginnings of a human body,  we are \"programmed\" to assign agency to it in much the same way that children assign agency and \"personhood\" to cartoon animals. Our minds are almost forced to imagine a future and inner life (mind) for such a thing, even if we have little to no reason to assume that this is actually sensible from a factual perspective. Many of us don't do this in the case of a freshly fertilized egg cell even though this has all the same ingredients for a future life. Yet there are a lot of people who don't see any sense in stopping at dumb sentimentality. They force themselves to the next level and believe in the full humanity of a group of stem cells. Taking things to their logical conclusion, some of them will then argue that it ought to be illegal to even use condoms. After all, a month that goes by without the chance of pregnancy is a lost opportunity for new life. Whatever else is sex good for? The next step is forcing women into pregnancy by force, over and over and over. Well, no one is proposing this last thing, though it's almost hard to imagine why exactly this is the case, at least from their fanatical moral perspective? If it's okay to facilitate unplanned pregnancies and then force women to remain pregnant and give birth against their will, then what other reason than a naturalistic fallacy is there to not artificially inseminate them at regular intervals if they fail to find active breeding mates of their own? \n\nOh and John Kerry may or may not be a hypocrite, but it is entirely reasonable for him to be pro-choice on a basis other than how he views the death of fetuses. There happen to be a great many solid reasons to keep the practice legal. Even if we grant it agency, mind or personhood the fetus isn't the only party that's involved. A lot of people are pro-choice despite their personal sentiments regarding the practice.

Chavez consistently maintained the support of a majority of the people and somehow did manage to survive the military coup against him. Americans (for instance The New York Times) enthusiastically called Chavez a dictator pretty much from the get-go, not because he was one, but because he didn't respect the property rights of American corporations and just generally wasn't malleable. His cookyness and his ,at times, highly questionable domestic maneuvers were merely welcome fodder for nationalist US drivel.

Well, I'd like to see a source for that, because I think it's hard to deny that Egypt's main value is the fact that the Suez Canal runs through it. That's like the main artery for the traffic of Middle East oil. Losing control over the Canal is simply unacceptable for the US. Also, Israel is a nuclear power and it's been 4 decades since the last war between Egypt and Israel. Anyway, I'm not an expert, but for the US and other major powers virtually everything in that region is ultimately about oil, including military aid to Egypt, decent Egypt-Israel relations and the fact that Israel became an ally of the US to begin with. \n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1hpa5h", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cawnhse", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1373061970", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cawkkbz", "score": 7, "retrieved_on": 1430572913, "controversiality": 0, "body": "They couldn't do that, that's the point.

Compare section 1 of articles 1 and 2. Both sections enumerate the powers held by the legislative and executive branches. Here's what article 1 says (emphasis added):\n\n\"All legislative powers **herein granted** shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.\"\n\nOk, this is pretty clear. All of Congress' power is outlined in this article (hence the \"herein granted\"). \n\nArticle 2 (just the relevant part):\n\n\"The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America\"\n\nOk...this is less clear, there isn't a restrictive preface like in article 1. Sure, the rest of article 2 lays out some of the presidential powers, but there are no limitations like before. The framers weren't dumb, there were a lot of arguments over not only what powers each branch of the government would get, but how the powers were phrased. Side note: one of the big oversights (in my opinion) of the constitutional convention was that the framers drafted article 2 for George Washington: a dude so awesome and so full of integrity that it was difficult to imagine that he'd abuse his powers. Granted, the executive branch was, at the time, a totally new way of approaching power. It was a huge gamble. \n\nSo anyways, back to executive power. Are there limits? The Unitary Executive Theory says \"not really.\" Some people, most notably Prince of Darkness Dick Cheney, think that the president's power is unlimited because of article 2 section 1 and the take care clause further on in article 2. Others believe that there are limits, but they don't go so far as Cheney et al. Other people disagree with the theory altogether and say that article 2 has inherent limits. All because of (essentially) the word \"herein.\" \n\n\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1b2xnr", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c936hbq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364357762", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Cdr_Obvious", "id": "t1_c933un6", "parent_id": "t3_1b2xnr", "score": -3, "retrieved_on": 1431715009, "controversiality": 1, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1b2xnr", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c933un6", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364349785", "distinguished": null, "ups": -3}

It was meant to be the states.\"  First, Alexander Hamliton and John Addams would strenuously disagree.\n\nFurthermore, who cares what the founding fathers wanted?  They certainly didn't want the constitution to dictate to use how to run our government.  The Constitution was a document meant to set up a government for them and their times.  The reason it still works is that it is flexible and we change both it and the ways we interpret it to suit our needs. \n\nThe Senate also used to be chosen by State Houses, the presidents were chosen by electors who were usually appointed by the State Houses.  In the election of 1800 only about three states actually held any voting for president at all.  The founders held slaves and oppressed women - is that how we should do it today?\n\nMaking an argument about politics or government by invoking what the founders wanted is NOT an argument - it is a substitute for critical thinking and a substitute for an actual argument.  Ironically, the founders (Jefferson esp.) did NOT want what you just did to ever happen.
