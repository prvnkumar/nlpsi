As-Suwayda is to the east of the main combat zone that runs in an arc from Damascus through Homs and Hamah to Idlib. That means they should see less fighting. Given that As-Suwayda is in the southern portion of the country, it also means they have a higher likelihood of falling under the jurisdiction of the Free Syrian Army and Syrian National Coalition. Though by no means perfect, the FSA has shown a willingness to protect religious minorities and be accountable to civilian officials. Those should both be good news of sorts. \n\nThe bad news is that &gt;5.8 million Syrians are internally displaced. If you haven't heard from your cousins in a while, I'd hope they don't fall into this category. There are also less tolerant groups within the opposition, and the territorial divisions aren't always clear cut (what was originally al Qa'ida in Iraq is now operating all the way on the Mediterranean coast). I'm not just referring to the Islamists, whom have their own moderates all the way to the takfirists who would likely see the Druze as apostates. War sucks.\n\nBut given the location, I think your cousins may have a better than average chance of having suffered minimally.\n\nedit - and if they're in a regime-held area away from the frontlines, they're probably fine.

The UN is nominally supposed to represent all nations rather equally. Some organizations, like the WHO, World Bank, and IMF assist some countries with money and officials predominantly coming from a different set of countries. NATO, MERCOSUR, ASEAN, and other organizations can be comprised of a select group of countries for a select purpose (NATO is North Atlantic countries for security, ASEAN is Southeast Asian states and economics). What is best for some the members of some organizations may not be best for the global commons. As the leader of the liberal international order since WWII, the U.S. has been in the primary position to shape a great deal of these international organizations. \n\nArguably, the U.S. role in establishing and building these organizations has *led* to unprecedented international peace and stability. That was because such peace and stability *was* the U.S. interest. \n\nNow, with increasing globalization and decentralization of power to increasing states and actors, those who oppose U.S. actions may have more influence in international bodies. Whereas the U.S. could often, and still often does, work through international bodies before, there are times when unilateral or multilateral action with a \"coalition of the willing\" becomes far more expedient to solve a problem. \n\nTo answer further, OP would have to outline their vision of international peace and stability. As an example, the 2003 Iraq War created additional instability, but given the enforcement of no-fly zones continuously since the end of the Gulf War, there wasn't peace.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I'll make a couple of points.\n\nFirst, I will answer the subject's question. The existence of a debate that few in the mainstream pay attention to is not the same as their being no debate. Rather, this debate has taken place within think tanks, congressional hearings, DoD planning offices, intelligence agencies, and diplomatic offices in Washington, D.C. and many other places. The American public, by and large, just doesn't give a damn. \n\nSecond, \"the wrong hands\" is a general statement, but it means jihadists. Jabhat al-Nusra is a faction that is al-Qa'ida affiliated and essentially comprised of fighters who earned their skills killing Americans and Iraqi security forces. Several Salafist groups, religious hardliners, have likewise rejected cooperation with more moderate or secular groups  because they have a very different view of what a post-Assad Syria looks like. These groups are interested in a parochial vision, and thus are not compatible with American interests or those of a large swatch of Syrians. \n\nThird, OP referenced the video of the the commander of the Faruq brigade eating the lung of his enemy. That video has been confirmed as real. This is where sensational and graphic images can shock public opinion, but obscure facts on the ground. What he did was barbaric, and he was instantly condemned, and now wanted, by most opposition groups because that is abhorrent behavior to them as well. Though it is easy for us to be outraged over here, I doubt every single one of us would remain sane when subject to two years of terror and atrocity. He does not represent the entire opposition.\n\nBuilding on the previous point, the longer the conflict rages, the more depraved things will get. Jihadists and Salafists are tapped into international networks for arms and funds because of their ties to other militant groups or religious networks, respectively. This makes them more effective than moderate groups, which in turns attracts recruits who would not normally be attracted to fundamentalism. This is thus creating a race against time whereby the longer the conflict burns, the greater the number of increasingly extremist militants will be left in Syria. They will either exacerbate the difficulties of piecing Syria back together again, or may go involve themselves in jihads elsewhere. \n\nFourth, since Assad's government is supported by Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah, and the hardliners/extremists are supported through their networks, that really leaves the groups most conducive to a Syria able to integrate into the region and work with most countries out in the cold. Arming these groups gives them a chance to contradict the above trend. \n\n\"Peace\" is not the goal, nor is it realistic given Assad's rejection of every proposal neighbors or the UN have put forward. And a peace where the status quo favors extremist groups would do little more than turn Syria into a ticking time bomb of fanaticism. This is a battle for Syria's soul, and that has grave implications for the future of the Middle East. On the whole, I am incredulous that this is often over-looked. \n\nNow that I think I have made the case for \"do something rather than nothing\", OP's points about the difficulties of action are spot on. Giving weapons to unaccountable groups and not keeping tabs on them is likely to create negative consequences down the road. If you read into this, the term \"vetted\" is constantly thrown around to describe background checks into the nature, goals, and affiliations of any group we'd supply. Yet no matter how \"vetted\" a group is, there exist rivalries and battlefield conditions where assistance may wind up in the hands of non-desirables. And the largest determinant of what happens is whether the U.S. stays involved. A panelist at an event I was at earlier in the week used the phrase \"we own it\" to describe the outcome of supplying arms to rebel groups in regards to the post-conflict. We owned Afghanistan '91 and just abandoned it, allowing the Taliban to set up shop. Aid would require a long-term  commitment. \n\nPolicy-making is often choosing the least terrible from among the terrible options. The U.S. doesn't have many options on Syria, and anything action taken is going to be difficult and risky. The \"right\" policy is hard. If security decisions were easy, we wouldn't make what are, in hindsight, mistakes nearly so often. We don't even know what Syria will look like at the end of everything. However, we can try to create influence, or we can sit back and be forced to accept whatever is dealt.\n\nNational security is a constant process, independent of budget or domestic concerns. In a globalized world, events in places like Syria will have increasing impacts on regional and global trade and stability, and cannot be ignored. What happens in Syria will have ramifications for decades at least, which begs closer attention than many have given it under the guise of \"we can't afford it.\"\n\nResources:\nForeign Policy Magazine or Foreign Affairs often cover Syria\nThe Center for Naval Analyses just released a report on rebel factionalization\nHell, Twitter is a great place to look if you shift through things under #Syria\n\nEdited: added paragraph above final paragraph", "id": "t1_cam7x9j", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "FP_Addict", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I might add that moralism on peace or killing skews perspectives.
