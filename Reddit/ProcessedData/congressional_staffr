In 2008, the [Green Party of the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_the_United_States) nominated McKinney for [President of the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States).

As a member of the [Democratic Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Democratic_Party), she served six terms in the [United States House of Representatives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives). In 2008, the [Green Party of the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_the_United_States) nominated McKinney for [President of the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States).

When her district was redrawn and renumbered due to the [Supreme Court of the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States) ruling in Miller v. Johnson, McKinney was easily elected from the new 4th District in the [1996 election](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_election,_1996), and was re-elected twice without substantive opposition.\n\n&gt;McKinney was defeated by [Denise Majette](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denise_Majette) in the 2002 Democratic primary.

Traditionally, Appropriators write 12 different bills, each clears the House and Senate and is signed into law, all before the start of the Fiscal Year on October 1 (Fiscal Year 2014 started on October 1, 2013 - that's when the shutdown occurred, of course).  \n\nTo illustrate - the budget we passed in December ([HJ Res 59](http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20131209/AMNT-113-HJRes59sa-1R_xml.pdf)) weighs in at 77 pages.

Even if the member disagrees with you, it's good to have staff respect you.  \n\nFor instance, we have regulars that call occasionally.  There's one who's a really nice guy, very well spoken, that NEVER agrees with what the boss does.  Nonetheless, when he calls (often enough, but not too often - about once a month), he will generally ask for me by name, and I'll have a 30 minute convo with him (about the only other people around the Hill that can have 30 minutes of my time randomly, much less scheduled in advance are my spouse, and my boss - I rarely even schedule a lobbyist meeting for more than 15).   \n\nDespite the fact neither of us will ever change the other's mind, and in my job position it is rare bordering on never that I'll take calls from constituents.

In other words, that's who you REALLY want to connect with, and asking for that person shows you know how the game is played.  If you leave nice messages, or potentially write nice/cordial emails (offices will almost ALWAYS give you that person's direct email if you ask - they'll rarely if ever give you that person's direct extension, though), you may well be able to strike up a dialogue with them. (side note - striking up an ongoing dialogue on an issue would be an exception to my prior comment about making your contacts timely; with all due respect, a staffer is more likely to give a random constituent who calls 20 minutes to discuss an issue when he's NOT swamped from every which way by lobbyists/other offices/etc trying to sway his boss.

Even if the member disagrees with you, it's good to have staff respect you.  \n\nFor instance, we have regulars that call occasionally.  There's one who's a really nice guy, very well spoken, that NEVER agrees with what the boss does.  Nonetheless, when he calls (often enough, but not too often - about once a month), he will generally ask for me by name, and I'll have a 30 minute convo with him (about the only other people around the Hill that can have 30 minutes of my time randomly, much less scheduled in advance are my spouse, and my boss - I rarely even schedule a lobbyist meeting for more than 15).   \n\nDespite the fact neither of us will ever change the other's mind, and in my job position it is rare bordering on never that I'll take calls from constituents.  Just because he's intelligent, well spoken, and cordial.  \n\nAnother comment that'll show you're informed - if you call, ask to talk to the \"LA [pronounced like the city in California] who handles X.\"  That's who will write you a letter if you write, and that's who advises the Rep on that issue.  In other words, that's who you REALLY want to connect with, and asking for that person shows you know how the game is played.  If you leave nice messages, or potentially write nice/cordial emails (offices will almost ALWAYS give you that person's direct email if you ask - they'll rarely if ever give you that person's direct extension, though), you may well be able to strike up a dialogue with them. (side note - striking up an ongoing dialogue on an issue would be an exception to my prior comment about making your contacts timely; with all due respect, a staffer is more likely to give a random constituent who calls 20 minutes to discuss an issue when he's NOT swamped from every which way by lobbyists/other offices/etc trying to sway his boss.  Calling during recesses can be good for building a relationship like that.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_celw91s", "parent_id": "t1_celbed4", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431878370, "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": 1389328444, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1u3my0", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_celw91s", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1389328237", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1u3my0", "selftext": "But yes - generally speaking, on nearly ANY issue, the ONLY person in the office that actually KNOWS the issue, to include knowing that it's on the calendar for a vote oftentimes (unless he/she anticipates in advance it'll be controversial) that might be willing to talk to a random constituent is the LA who handles the issue.

You're a staffer, *so you know this.*  It's the overriding concern of every candidate, every day.  I need to raise X by such and such a date to stand a chance at getting re-elected. \n\nYes, voters do have some ability to affect the outcome of elections.  But it is not the voters who determine which candidates are viable to run in the first place.  It is the *funders* who determine who is viable. \n\nAnd yes, if the voters are rabidly against a stance, there's nothing in the world that'll save a politician who has that stance **and has an opponent who opposes that stance.** - the latter is key. \n\nBut if the Democratic candidate and the Republican candidate have the same stance, there's not much blowback, is there.  Look at the way that background checks failed in the House.  This was a measure that an overwhelming majority of Americans - an overwhelming majority of gun owners, *and an overwhelming majority of NRA members* supported.  It failed, despite public opinion, because gun manufacturers and their lobbying groups pressured politicians on BOTH sides of the aisle.  \n\nThe point is, if I'm broadly liberal, and I have a democratic representative, what am I going to do, vote him out if I disagree with him on issues #10 through #1000?  And let the Republican in, who I disagree with on issues #1 to #1000?  It's a two party system!  \n\nThat two party system, by the way, is a function of our winner-take-all system.  This is why proportional representation is such a big deal.  So that I don't feel like I'm wasting my time when I vote in an election here in TX HD136 (gerrymandered) TX SD 5 (gerrymandered) CD-31 (gerrymandered) and for senators, governors, and the electoral college (Until this election year, Texas was non-competitive.) \n\nMoney is strong.  Votes are weak.  So is it any wonder why I have trouble believing that politicians aren't willing to risk losing a few voters in exchange for some campaign cash? \n\nLook at Obamacare.  The people are overwhelmingly opposed to \"health insurance mandates\" and overwhelmingly supportive of \"public option.\"  What did we get?  We got what the health insurance industry - which generates a lot of money for candidates - wanted.  \n\nSOPA and PIPA are the exception to the rule, and even then it's not much of an exception.  It wasn't the grassroots that defeated SOPA and PIPA, it was the large Internet corporations who expressed their dissatisfaction with it.  When Google goes dark, you know you've ticked off a sleeping giant - Google is a huge corporation.  But also, Reddit and OReilly went dark.  That's two media major companies there giving their opposition to SOPA/PIPA - Conde Nast and O'Reilly Media.  \n\nMost importantly, *Moveon.org* went dark.  MoveON is a federal PAC!  They ARE the funders!  \n\nEven if I'm wrong on this, there is an overwhelming public perception that \"money buys results in Congress\" and even this perception of corruption undermines legitimacy in a Democracy.  If you poll non-voters on this issue, you'll find the overwhelming reason they don't vote is because: \"It doesn't matter who wins, politicians will side with the monied interests anyway.\" Whether or not that's true, people are losing the ability to believe that they have a say in their government. \n\nOf course, I think the evidence is overwhelming that it is true. \n\nKeep in mind, this influence the funders have isn't just on what the officials do *after* they get elected.  It also determines *who* gets elected.  It's not that, for example, insurance companies try to buy votes after the election, but they'll give money to candidates to get them through the primary and into office.  The funders select *eligibility* and *viability* for public office. \n\nSo we have politicians with a *duty* to serve the people, but all the incentives are aligned to serve the *funders.*  We can fix this problem by making the citizens the funders through citizen-funded elections.  \n\n\n", "id": "t1_cdfa0i6", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "BrianBoyko", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdfa0yk", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cdfa0i6", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428643831, "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1qjtby", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdfa0yk", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384554834", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdejg0a", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428643837, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1qjtby", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdfa0i6", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384554802", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdeijp5", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428656459, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdejg0a", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384471173", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

", "id": "t1_cdejg0a", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "congressional_staffr", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "It took me a while to come up to a response to this because I wanted to get this right.  \n\nFor the sake of argument, let's assume voters do have a big stick.  *They do not get the first whack.*\n\nIn order for a candidate to be viable at any level of government, they must raise ungodly amounts of money.  You're a staffer, *so you know this.*  It's the overriding concern of every candidate, every day.  I need to raise X by such and such a date to stand a chance at getting re-elected. \n\nYes, voters do have some ability to affect the outcome of elections.  But it is not the voters who determine which candidates are viable to run in the first place.  It is the *funders* who determine who is viable. \n\nAnd yes, if the voters are rabidly against a stance, there's nothing in the world that'll save a politician who has that stance **and has an opponent who opposes that stance.** - the latter is key. \n\nBut if the Democratic candidate and the Republican candidate have the same stance, there's not much blowback, is there.  Look at the way that background checks failed in the House.  This was a measure that an overwhelming majority of Americans - an overwhelming majority of gun owners, *and an overwhelming majority of NRA members* supported.  It failed, despite public opinion, because gun manufacturers and their lobbying groups pressured politicians on BOTH sides of the aisle.  \n\nThe point is, if I'm broadly liberal, and I have a democratic representative, what am I going to do, vote him out if I disagree with him on issues #10 through #1000?  And let the Republican in, who I disagree with on issues #1 to #1000?  It's a two party system!  \n\nThat two party system, by the way, is a function of our winner-take-all system.  This is why proportional representation is such a big deal.  So that I don't feel like I'm wasting my time when I vote in an election here in TX HD136 (gerrymandered) TX SD 5 (gerrymandered) CD-31 (gerrymandered) and for senators, governors, and the electoral college (Until this election year, Texas was non-competitive.) \n\nMoney is strong.  Votes are weak.  So is it any wonder why I have trouble believing that politicians aren't willing to risk losing a few voters in exchange for some campaign cash? \n\nLook at Obamacare.  The people are overwhelmingly opposed to \"health insurance mandates\" and overwhelmingly supportive of \"public option.\"  What did we get?  We got what the health insurance industry - which generates a lot of money for candidates - wanted.  \n\nSOPA and PIPA are the exception to the rule, and even then it's not much of an exception.  It wasn't the grassroots that defeated SOPA and PIPA, it was the large Internet corporations who expressed their dissatisfaction with it.  When Google goes dark, you know you've ticked off a sleeping giant - Google is a huge corporation.  But also, Reddit and OReilly went dark.  That's two media major companies there giving their opposition to SOPA/PIPA - Conde Nast and O'Reilly Media.  \n\nMost importantly, *Moveon.org* went dark.  MoveON is a federal PAC!  They ARE the funders!  \n\nEven if I'm wrong on this, there is an overwhelming public perception that \"money buys results in Congress\" and even this perception of corruption undermines legitimacy in a Democracy.  If you poll non-voters on this issue, you'll find the overwhelming reason they don't vote is because: \"It doesn't matter who wins, politicians will side with the monied interests anyway.\" Whether or not that's true, people are losing the ability to believe that they have a say in their government. \n\nOf course, I think the evidence is overwhelming that it is true. \n\nKeep in mind, this influence the funders have isn't just on what the officials do *after* they get elected.  It also determines *who* gets elected.  It's not that, for example, insurance companies try to buy votes after the election, but they'll give money to candidates to get them through the primary and into office.  The funders select *eligibility* and *viability* for public office. \n\nSo we have politicians with a *duty* to serve the people, but all the incentives are aligned to serve the *funders.*  We can fix this problem by making the citizens the funders through citizen-funded elections.  \n\n\n", "id": "t1_cdfa0i6", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "BrianBoyko", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdfa0yk", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cdfa0i6", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428643831, "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1qjtby", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdfa0yk", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384554834", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdejg0a", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428643837, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1qjtby", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdfa0i6", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384554802", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdeijp5", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428656459, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdejg0a", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384471173", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cddtnp7", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428656878, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1qjtby", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdeijp5", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384469075", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cddpke2", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428668760, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cddtnp7", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384392918", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

What is the goal of our foreign policy?  \n\nPeople don't think about these things.  This is for two reasons - first, they know their vote doesn't matter much - we use \"winner take all\" and statistically, over half of those votes are \"wasted.\"  So people don't spend the time to learn about politics, because they feel like they have no say in the outcome of elections, and all learning more about politics will do will make them angry - impotently angry. \n\nWhen they do vote, they vote based on which candidate shares their *values.*  If you are a hard working father of two who makes $80,000 a year, you might lean Republican because the Republican \"brand\" values safety, low taxes, and rewarding hard work.  If you're a single mother making $40,000 a year, you might lean Democrat because the Democratic \"brand\" values women's rights, healthcare, and ensuring a safety net.  Neither one of these are \"wrong\" because values *cannot be* wrong. \n\nUnless your value is to hate gays or whatever. But for the most part...\n\nAnyway, what is happening is that we are starting to see a fundamental shift away from \"values\" to \"motive.\"\n\nThink of it as a pyramid.  Issues are on the tippy top.  They are specific questions with specific answers.  The answer a candidate makes is *based* upon the next lower layer in the pyramid, \"values.\"  If a candidate \"values hard work,\" they're likely to go for work-fare schemes, low taxes, etc. If a candidate \"values prosperity for all\", they're likely to go for social welfare programs, universal healthcare, and a progressive income tax.  \n\nWhat we have, though, under values, in the pyramid, is \"motive.\"\n\nAnd the motive layer is: \"Why do I want the job?  Who am I really working for?\"\n\nThere are good people on both sides of the aisle for whom \"to serve the people\" is still the answer.  But a lot of people have seen service in Congress as a farm league to the higher-paying jobs on K-street.  Not as many as you think - but still too many. \n\nThe problem is that money is so dominant in our elections that our elected officials - if they want to be re-elected or wield any influence within their party - have to continually raise funds.  They must \"always lean towards the green\" and for that reason they make a lot of decisions and spend a lot of time worrying about the issues that concern the 0.05% of Americans who fund campaigns, rather than the issues that affect all of us.  \n\nThere's ways to solve this problem, through citizen-funded elections and electoral reforms which would increase voter engagement by ending \"safe seats\" but the point is - 50%+ of Americans probably don't approve of their congressman.  Hell, I'm not even sure 50% of eligible voters actually vote - and that is not a political apathy borne of laziness but a rational apathy borne of the realization that it doesn't matter who you vote for - it is really money that buys results in Congress.

It entrenches it.  The harder it is to donate money to races/candidates and spend on political speech, the more advantaged an incumbent is.  Remember, everyone knows who he is. He gets earned media, mentions in the paper, whatever.  A challenger has to spend a few hundred thousand minimum to put himself on the same footing - much less to make a dent in the incumbent.    \n\nAnd really, term limits and lobbying limits aren't really as damning as people think they are.  \n\nIf a member is term limited, he just finds another job to run for. Senator, governor, whatever.  Or he goes private sector.  \n\nTo the point of lobbying restrictions, they exist to some extent now (I think it's 2 years, but it might be 4).  During that period, former members can't lobby.  Now, I'd agree that the short period is kind of pointless - either do it or don't.  But what they do in that window is informative.  The ones that want to enter the K Street world (rather than retire or run for gov or whatever) tend to sign on with lobby shops as consultants.  It works great for them, it's less work, and they still make shit tons of money.  Basically the member just sits in his office, and when a client comes in wanting to lobby on X, the member never actually lobbies.  He just tells his colleagues, \"oh - you want to talk to Congressman Doe on that. Here's his #.\"  \n\nAnd then of course, there's the pesky Constitution.  Term limits are unconstitutional without amendment.  And the first amendment is pretty clear that people have the right to petition their government.

He certainly doesn't know their name. \n\nContrast with the Hill, where while yes, staff are unelected, there isn't generally the kind of wide latitude there is in an administration position.  My desk is less than 20 feet from my boss's.  He knows my name.  He interviewed me personally and pulled the trigger on hiring.  And on the flip side, if I screw something up bad, he feels the heat.\n\nUnless we're going to either drastically shrink government, or outsource even more decision making from Congress to agencies, shrinking Hill staff in my mind is reckless.

It is exceedingly stupid to tell the American people they can't elect the person they want to - especially when given the status quo, if you implemented term limits tomorrow the effect would be exactly opposite of the desired effect.  \n\nCongressional approval is a red herring.  The fact that 88% (or whatever) of people disapprove of Congress as a whole means absolutely nothing when the same people approve of their own Member of Congress.  \n\nMy boss could give two shits about what someone thinks if they don't live in our district.  \n\nAs far as your money comments, again, you're missing the point.  More campaign finance restrictions makes fundraising even more lopsided.  That's why incumbents support restrictions in a vacuum.  Limit people to $10 maximum donations.  Who's going to raise the most money? The incumbent. \n\nOpen up fundraising, eliminate restrictions, and more incumbents will lose.  That's good.  \n\nAs to your last point, it is absolutely impossible for ANY member of Congress to know the issues generally, or specific legislation on the floor, well enough to make a decision without staff.  Look at this week's floor schedule (from the party of your choice - [Democrats](http://www.democraticwhip.gov/content/weekly-whip-friday-july-26-2013) or [Republicans](http://majorityleader.gov/floor/weekly.html)) for God's sake.  \n\nAs far as me letting people know, what do you think I'm doing here?  I'm not going to destroy my career for 15 minutes of internet fame. But this is a decent halfway point.  \n\nAgain - the \"reforms\" you're aiming for will have the opposite effect you want them to.  \n\nTerm limits = more staff control.  Money restrictions = more reliance on name recognition/incumbency, and more power held by a central party rather than an individual member (which means good luck with a dark horse challenger taking out an incumbent in a primary).", "id": "t1_cbcsv6o", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "congressional_staffr", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cbb3ylv", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430121640, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cbcsv6o", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1375129598", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

I wouldn't pretend to be particularly knowledgeable about the cogs and gears of our government, but I propose that many of the changes that our people would like to make to our government on a fundamental/Constitutional level would require much more work and pain that simply replacing that one single gear - when a system has been developing in a certain way for so many generations, you can't just say \"we're doing this differently now\" and expect any sort of a smooth transition.\n\nMy point is that no change would be easy or pain-free or without reasons why we *shouldn't* try. Does that mean that all of the associated problems are insurmountable or that the core principle being addressed is not worth implementing? In many cases, I'm sure the answer is \"yes\". In this case, if we imposed limits to congressional terms, the influx of freshmen congressmen into the shark tank full of \"policy wonks\" (I'd like to steal that term, thanks), would cause other problems that would need to be addressed. The question in this instance becomes, \"Which is the greater issue - career congressmen doing whatever they can to stay in office at the cost of ethics and integrity, or the effort we would have to spend to put new congressmen on a level playing field?\"\n\nI don't know the answers to these questions, but I do think there are some cases in which a change to a more favorable principle is worth it despite the associated pains. \n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1j3lx7", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cbat18m", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1374857124", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1j3lx7", "id": "t1_cbatjyt", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "MCwaffle89", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I don't think it's quite as conspiratorial as you put it, only in that when they choose to exercise it, the power does still reside with the people.  \n\nThe Amash vote is a great example - even though it failed, the leadership of both parties was pushing hard for no votes.

Running the government isn't about \"voting your conscience.\"  It's about making ruthelessly difficult decisions because something leads you to believe it's in the best interest of the country.  And that requires the longest of long games.  If you just walk in blindly, you don't have the perspective to make those decisions with the proper information.  That's why the government requires a more permanent staffing structure.  It's also why the government benefits from having veteran leadership to guide discussion and broker deals across the aisle.  It's much easier to build on relationships than start new ones.  If you get rid of veteran leadership in the House and Senate, you NEED someone around to provide guidance on how it all works on the Hill.  A lot of times that includes advice on how to vote.  And if someone is clueless, that advice can become more commanding.\n\nYou're thoughts make intuitive sense, but no practical sense.

It is exceedingly stupid to tell the American people they can't elect the person they want to - especially when given the status quo, if you implemented term limits tomorrow the effect would be exactly opposite of the desired effect.  \n\nCongressional approval is a red herring.  The fact that 88% (or whatever) of people disapprove of Congress as a whole means absolutely nothing when the same people approve of their own Member of Congress.  \n\nMy boss could give two shits about what someone thinks if they don't live in our district.  \n\nAs far as your money comments, again, you're missing the point.  More campaign finance restrictions makes fundraising even more lopsided.  That's why incumbents support restrictions in a vacuum.  Limit people to $10 maximum donations.

That's good.  \n\nAs to your last point, it is absolutely impossible for ANY member of Congress to know the issues generally, or specific legislation on the floor, well enough to make a decision without staff.

Of course not. That wasn't my assertion.  \n\nBut those issues quite often are brought up as planks of much larger bills - whether part of the budget, or inserted into an appropriations bill, or what have you.  And as I said (and I could if I wanted to provide specific examples), I could bend an R that came in saying he'll NEVER vote for gun control in any form, or a D who came in saying he'd NEVER vote to restrict abortion in any form, to vote for legislation that does just those things.  EVEN if that legislation is going to be scored/etc.  \n\nAnd to be absolutely clear - there'd be no subterfuge.  He'd know exactly what he was voting for, and know that he was flipping on that issue.  But he's \"taking one for the team\".  Or defending himself against a challenge from the [right or left, as the case may be].\n\nAre the obscure issues the ones where members are more easily swayable? Sure.

It's a matter of a member coming to town and being lulled into taking the party line, without question.

Well, we need you to vote for this bill.  We know this bill includes X.  Just trust us - it's best for the team.  And don't worry - we'll give you all the support you need in two years. Just support us now.\"\n\nLeadership does that frequently. If your DC job was at all Hill related, you'd know that. \n\nAnd just as leadership does that, staff can (and do) do that.

In other words, many close-to-retirement middle class workers (ie, many Members of Congress) are millionaires on paper when you include home equity and retirement savings among other illiquid assets.  \n\nFurther, as a result of the vagaries of the DC housing market, a member that has served in Congress more than about 10 years and bought a townhouse on the Hill at that time (when the neighborhood was slightly more \"downtrodden\" and thus slightly more affordable) has had on paper wealth accumulation in the neighborhood of $500k just from buying a townhouse.  \n\nJust looking at that list of \"millionaires\" (which is quite old - the [Post has newer and better data](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/capitol-assets/congressional-wealth-risk-matrix/)), I see a number (whose living situations in DC I'm familiar with) that for lack of a better word have a \"college style\" homelife in DC.  3 or 4 other members as roommates, sleeping on the couch in their office, etc.  \n\nI don't know many people who truly are \"rich\" who would decide at age 50 to live with 3 other 50 year olds, or sleep on the couch 4 nights a week (believe it or not, neither of those things is much of a selling point on the campaign trail - some members will use the couch sleeping thing as a throwaway line, but I don't know anyone who's won or lost based on whether he did/didn't sleep on the couch).  \n\nCampaign finance laws already skew membership in the body toward the wealthy (since the wealthy can self fund).  Skewing it further that way through cuts to/elimination of a member salary benefits no one except the 1%.\n\nEDIT: An illustration of the college style roommate situations I discussed earlier in today's [Roll Call](http://hoh.rollcall.com/rat-becomes-newest-housemate-for-durbin-schumer/).

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1hq58t", "selftext": "I apologize in advance for writing a novel; trying to hit each candidate. \n\nTL, DR: Assuming they get through a primary process, strongest in a general - D's - Schweitzer or O'Malley; R's - Marco, Jindal, or maybe Cruz.\n\nFirst, there's no such thing as any coordinated \"national strategists\" meeting at either party right now, at least to \"settle\" on a candidate.  \n\nThe parties stay neutral on these things (as far as I know, it's a rules requirement for both - but I do official and not political, so I'm not 100% about the inner workings of the parties).  \n\nAnd aside from any requirement, it's a practical thing - when a candidate is picked, they're the effective party head for the cycle, and then (assuming they win) for the next 4+ years.  And even if they don't win, their team stays in place (look at the RNC; the DNC actually did swap things around a bit after their losses to Bush, but I think that's somewhat abnormal historically).  \n\nAnyway, you don't want the candidate to come in and think you as a party politico are anything but loyal to him/her.  \n\nThe political strategists that are active right now are the guns for hire - ie the consultants (think the Axelrods and the Roves).  They hitch to a guy running, collect a big check either way, and if their guy wins, all the better.  \n\nBut to the underlying question - \n\nD's - \nJoe Biden - He's Joe Biden.  If he runs he's obviously got somewhat of a head start by virtue of his current job (though somewhat abnormally I think, I wouldn't be surprised if his name recognition were actually lower than Hillary's). \nBut if he runs, it's only a matter of time before he says something dumb - hopefully for the D's it's in the primary so he's knocked out then, and not after he somehow gets to a general.\n\nHillary - Again, she's Hillary.  She's got name rec, but her unfavorables are pretty high too - people don't like her (and not just R's - independents, and even some D's).  Her husband is a liability just as much as he's an asset; like it or not, she runs and there are plenty of ominous \"Do you really want Bill Clinton in the White House again?\" ads.  I don't think she's the strongest candidate in a general, honestly. \n\nCuomo - He's a New Yorker.  Not necessarily an asset.  He's a liberal governor from one of the most liberal (and already in the bag) states in the country.  And he's abrasive.  \n\nGillibrand - She's a New Yorker.  She's not as abrasive (nor as liberal) as Cuomo, but she's also an unknown. I don't see it. \n\nO'Malley - He's from Maryland.  That's good (in that DC types know him, so he ought to be able to get his foot in the door early with DC money).  He's got a fairly compelling story (I'm not going to relay the whole thing, but read up on his rise to power in the city of Baltimore and MD generally).  He's liberal enough to make the left wing of the party happy, but he doesn't come across as a liberal on the stump - that's important.  He's a strong dark horse. \n\nPatrick - My ad as an R running against him - Massachusetts liberal.  \n\nSchweitzer - Would be strong as a general given that he's a popular governor in what should be one of the strongest R states in the country.  Which makes it nearly impossible for him to get through a D primary. \n\nWarner - Brings some of the assets of an O'Malley - but he's got more baggage by virtue of having governed a right-of-center state (and thus having had outspoken opposition).  And of course his story isn't as compelling (\"hedge fund millionaire decides he's bored and wants a new challenge, so he runs for political office.\")\n\nWarren - Same ads as Patrick. Massachusetts liberal.  Also, have you ever seen her speak?  Makes even the most liberal people I know cringe.\n\nR's - \nJeb Bush - gets tied to everything his brother did (or didn't do).  Would be suicidal. \n\nChristie - Abrasive (like Cuomo).  That's not necessarily a good thing, certainly in an R primary. He's got some assets to run on (fighting spending/teachers unions/etc), but has some baggage (Obama photo ops, positions on guns, etc) in a primary.  He's strong in a general if he gets through a primary (a tough fight).  \n\nCruz - He's obviously strong in a primary; has done a great job of pandering to the wings of the party.  In a general he's got to tack left obviously, but I don't think that's impossible.  He's got a short record, and he's been consistent. In a general I think he could frame everything he's done as \"fighting Obama\" - and if Obama/his accomplishments remain as unpopular as they are now, he could have the same kind of success running against the last guy rather than his current opponent as Obama did. \n\nJindal - Popular guy, compelling story, overwhelming electoral success (his last reelect he had 80+% of the vote I think) in a state that popular opinion would say wouldn't be the biggest fan of a brown guy.  He's generally good on the stump.  He can get wonky (that's his background pre-Congress), which could get him bogged down. But if he can get through a primary and not get caught up in that, he's strong. \n\nMartinez - She's an unknown for most people.  Popular western governor, libertarian streak.  The libertarian vote flocks to Paul, so I think she's got no base in a primary. \n\nPaul - Gets his dad's voters.  I think Cruz takes the more mainstream voters that Paul would need to get through a primary if he's in.  If he's not, Paul could get further than his dad ever did.  Paul would bring to the table in a general the ability to appeal across the aisle to disaffected D's on national security/NSA/drone type stuff.  \n\nRubio - If immigration gets through he's strong in a general. But the immigration bill is a detriment in a primary (cue ad with Marco and Schumer).  If he can get his story straight and get over that hump, he's probably the R's best shot. \n\nRyan - Has the same wonkish problems of Jindal.  Plus he's been tarred as a loser.  Plus he can be hitched to every unpopular thing the R's in the House do by virtue of being Budget Committee Chairman.  \n\nSantorum - He ONLY appeals to social conservatives.  They're a dwindling portion of the R vote.  And not only that, he doesn't have a stellar fiscal conservative record.  Him getting as far as he did before was a fluke.  I'd be surprised if he even got in.\n\nIf I could pick my ideal irrespective of primary chances, it'd be O'Malley or Schweitzer on the D side, and Cruz, Jindal, or Rubio on the R side.

Are you interested in helping get people you like elected (ie campaign work)? \n\nEither way do not, in any way, shape, or form, get a poli-sci degree.  \n\nThey're a dime a dozen.  I know people in hiring positions on Capitol Hill (me included) on both sides of the aisle that either don't hire poli sci degrees, or consider a non poli sci degree a tie breaker.  \n\nAnd if your goal is to serve as an elected official, depending on where you're trying to get elected, a poli sci degree makes you an \"insider\".  There are actually some places where that's good.  There are many where that's not.  \n\nSomeone with a poli sci degree thinks they know how things work, but they don't. At all.  \n\nIf you want to be staff - your education is completely irrelevant.  Should you get a college degree? Yes, if you want to get involved on the policy side.  Not as important necessarily for the political side.  I know people VERY successful on the political (ie campaign) side that either didn't bother with a college degree, or ended up going back part time to finish at 30 or something because they figured they probably should.  \n\nFrom the policy side, ANY degree is good.  I'm my boss's \"expert\" in areas that I knew exactly nothing about on the day I graduated with my college degree. \n\nFrom both political and policy, it's really about networking and who you know.  \n\nIf you want to be a candidate, you need to get involved with your local party. You need to be a grunt worker (ie volunteer extrordinaire) for a cycle or two.  Then maybe be an officer in the party.  Talk to party leaders about running for a local elected position - school board, dog catcher, City Council, whatever.  \n\nIf you look at the young guys in Congress, for example, that's usually what they did - they started on the bottom, and worked their way up.  If you want to be elected young, you need a solid resume.  \n\nAnd you need to be able to ask people for money.

And even if they do, there's a good chance the minority would rather watch it go down in flames than help the majority's leadership get the bill across the line.  \n\nWhile I'm not bored enough to actually go down the list of PL's from those years, one that comes to mind is the welfare reform/restructuring that Clinton signed.  \n\nRemember, for all but the first 2 years of his Presidency, Bill Clinton had a majority Republican House and Senate.  By definition he had to have Republican support to get things done.  And the inter-party animosity was such during that time (not a whole lot different than it is now) that I doubt much passed with all Dems and 30-ish Republicans. \n\nI'll also point out that from what I remember of the last few years, for the most part your premise is flawed.  \n\nI guess it depends what your definition of \"major\" legislation is, but again, very little has passed the House with all Dems and just enough R's to get over the line.
