Of course it's mathematically required that there is some inequality, and economically required that this inequality be of some significance.  But generally speaking, the higher a country's level of inequality, the higher its levels of crime and chances of civil unrest.\n\nA lot of people's problems with inequality comes from subjective value judgments.  It's definitely possible that in a different place, in a different time, no one would care if one person was born into a position where they did indeed control 99.9999% of a country's wealth.  But most people in developed countries like to think of equality and opportunity, along with freedom, as some of their most important national values and personal principles.\n\nI'm not sure which studies you're referring to that suggest \"as the rich gain more wealth, the poor do as well.\"  It strikes me as very likely that everyone gains (and loses) wealth at the same time as a country's economy goes through typical boom and bust cycles.  What I think people have a problem with is that in the past couple of decades, when the economy was booming in good times (from the early 90's recession until the Great Recession), there was a lot of new money which entered the country's wealth pool, and most people didn't \"get their share\".\n\nWhile it would be normal for a larger portion of this wealth to go to those who already had a higher amount of the wealth, it seems that nearly all of this new wealth went to the already very wealthy, while the vast majority of people didn't gain any new wealth at all (when taking inflation into account).  This is where the argument of the rich stealing opportunity from the poor comes from.  It's not just that there is a gap between the rich and the poor, but that this gap is basically the widest it's ever been.  There's also the issue of decreasing social mobility.  The widening wealth gap is made more disturbing to people by the fact that it is now more difficult than it used to be to \"climb the social ladder\" as it were, or basically move up from one quintile (or any other breakdown of income groups) into the next one.", "id": "t1_cdux7s5", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "SENACMEEPHFAIRMA", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1s8914", "id": "t1_cduzh79", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Naurgul", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1s8914", "selftext": "Please elaborate.

It acts pretty much the same way.  People generally accept this because we have seen a vast increase in quality of living for most of the time capitalism has been the dominate force.  History has examples of similar disparities and the resultant economy was, like today, much more prone to cycles of boom and bust.\n\nIf you want to think another way, the wealthy have a higher proclivity to save when they have an increase in income while the poor are more likely to spend.  The spending of the poor feeds into the wealth of the rich and some of that comes back to the poor in the form of wages or transfer payments.  Wages are obviously the better source since it generally implies that the poor are adding their contribution to production.\n\nWhen there is high profitability, that cycle has a sink at the top which causes more and more wealth to concentrate.  Eventually as this cycle gets out of balance, the rich run out of productive investments and we see more speculative bubbles as investors crowd out producers for traded resources.  Prices go up because of higher costs of materials and this increases the already downward pressure on wages to maintain profitability.  The poor have a more and more difficult time keeping up with inflation that is driven by increases in commodity costs or increased profit margins as in most cases they don't share in any part of that steam of income.  As more and more people slip from being able to maintain an acceptable standard of living, civic unrest will start to formant and  can eventually lead to increases in crime.  This can cause quality of life for many to deteriorate even further as physical insecurity is added to economic insecurity.  On the other side, profit margins stagnate because demand is dampened by a lack of capital.  This can cause producers to cut labor share even further which in turn will lead to decreased purchasing power for those that lose their jobs.  As a society we have been able to defer this a bit by increasing access to credit and via transfer payments via taxation, but this is only a temporary fix as eventually servicing the debt deteriorates cash flow for the poor even more creating a downward spiral of increased debt leading to deteriorating cash flow and repeat.  Transfer payments are a whole different discussion I'll avoid here.\n\nGrowth is therefore a key to the whole cycle above that allows the capital class to extract wealth from the productive classes.  As long as it is sufficient to maintain the income flow to the masses everything can continue to work as it does.  Once that share begins to decline, their behavior becomes more unpredictable.\n\nI'd argue many economists don't have a substantial grasp of the societal forces which underlie the equations they hold so dear.  Like all science, there are axioms upon which most of the rest of economics rest on.  When consumers are no longer rational, ideal systems fall apart.

The wages of the lower and middle class have been outpaced by inflation over the past 20 or 30 years; in a very real way, millenials are the first generation to be objectively worse off than their parents in terms of purchasing power.\n2. Despite rumblings of a troubled economy, the top bracket of earners has actually posted record increases in income. They are literally doing better than they have any time in the last 20 or 30 years, though the number in the upper bracket has dwindled.\n3. Even though both companies and wealthy individuals are posting record profits, little if any of this economic gain has been passed on to lower income earners. And, in spite of this success, unemployment remains high, jobs are cut to part time, and wages stagnate. This is very damning to the assertion that wealthy people and corporations pass that wealth onto others in the form of jobs and higher wages.\n4. Considering the demand side of the equation, this trend is untenable. People are less able to afford goods and services, forcing them further into debt and dependence. There is only so far manufacturing costs can be reduced, so companies will have to accept a decrease in their profit margins eventually or be in trouble. Not sure when this will happen, but it will if current trends continue.\n5. The same power players campaign for decreased taxes and public assistance, two factors which might preserve this model of business longer. They are working against their own interests because, in the corporate world, short term profit has been incentivized over long-term sustainability. Companies are literally bound by shareholder agreements to maximize returns on investment when, in reality, this is not always the best course of action. The sole motive being profit over all else, the economy is trading stability for profitability.\n6. In my opinion, something has to be done to correct all of this, or we may face another collapse. It is clear that many supply-side tenets have been all but proven a delusion. Yet, there is a large number of economists who remain apologists despite this evidence; they come up with alternative explanations which are convoluted and explain the data within the context of their preconceived ideology.

The US has traditionally had a very broad definition of free speech, and without a constitutional amendment saying that political speech can be regulated you'll only make the problem worse.\n\nThis last election for example. Obama's campaign raised $715 million, all from non-corporate donations smaller than $5,000 and Romney raised $446 million using the same rules. Who these people are is public knowledge, as is their field of employment and location. However, none repeat **NONE** of this over $1 billion dollars came directly from corporations or in denominations larger than $5,000. \n\nSo when people talk about corporate cash over the last few years, they aren't talking about campaign contributions they are talking about independent expenditures (sometimes called SuperPACs even thought they have nothing in common with actual PACs). These are non-campaign entities that can collect money in unlimited amounts and use it to engage in political speech, usually in the form of campaign commercials. The Supreme Court said that private citizens and groups are allowed to say whatever they want, that the first amendment protects their ability to engage in political speech. Single individuals were spending tens of millions of dollars advertising their political opinions, but as far as the Supreme Court goes, the dollars don't matter because \"electioneering\" is not considered an exception to free speech. \n\nSo even if you replace campaign funding with public funding, these private groups are still allowed to say things, they are protected by the first amendment. So if candidates are limited in funding, these groups will get even more power than they already have, you would only make the situation worse until there's either a constitutional amendment regarding \"electioneering\" speech or the Supreme Court needs to reverse its decision which it isn't likely to do any time soon.

Raise taxes to increase revenue, which directly solves the problem.\n\n2. Cut spending, which lowers revenue but causes huge amounts of human suffering but cutting essential services for people right when they need them the most. \n\n3. Stimulate the economy such that the economy is producing more wealth, and fewer people are using government social services. \n\nThat video promotes #2, which causes the most human suffering for real Americans out there. It promotes #2 at a time when tax rates on the rich are near historic lows. It could have promoted #3, and attempted to keep long term spending and taxes at current levels for the price of a one time large jump in the debt, but the makers of that video chose not to go with that. \n\nThe fact is raising taxes on the wealth directly solves more than a third of the debt problem directly, even when using 2009's numbers (the video chose that year because the debt was higher than other years so the argument that taxing the rich can't fix the deficit was stronger). Having a deficit isn't a problem, its the ratio of GDP to debt that is problematic, you don't want that to go down. With a 400 billion dollar deficit, our GDP/debt ratio doesn't change one way or the other, its a sustainable deficit. \n\nSo with 2009's numbers from the video, you solve 4/11ths of the total deficit problem. Today raising taxes on the wealthy to 1960's levels would nearly bring the deficit to 400 billion by itself. \n\nThere's a lot of money out there that wants people to believe certain things, and the idea that taxing the rich is useless is one of the things they want people to believe the most.

The 400 billion dollars saved (according to the video) by adopting a 44% effective tax rate on the wealthy brings us to a 600 billion dollar deficit per year, which is close to the sustainable debt level of 400 billion. \n\nWhat numbers in particular do you want a reference to? The 400 billion sustainability thing is from a recent Paul Krugman column that I can find for you if you need it. So is our expected deficit of less than 1 trillion this year.

At one point, I believe under Eisenhower, the top tax rate was 90%, but there were so many loopholes that the effective rate was less than half of that. That being said, we do have a relatively low tax rate amongst other developed nations, so I'm not opposed to legislation that would alter the tax code in some ways.\n\nThat being said, there's also a major issue with how much money we spend. You act as though budget cuts are eliminating the money people use for food, but for the most part that isn't the case.
