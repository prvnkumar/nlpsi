The proposition being that voting was largely limited to white men who owned property. I would think the 15th and 19th amendments speak to the first two qualities, but maybe you'd like to push back. Finally, I point you generally and specifically to here: [1] (http://www.history.org/Foundation/journal/spring07/elections.cfm). Money quote: \"Property requirements were widespread. Some colonies required a voter to own a certain amount of land or land of a specified value. Others required personal property of a certain value, or payment of a certain amount of taxes. Examples from 1763 show the variety of these requirements. Delaware expected voters to own fifty acres of land or property worth \u00a340. Rhode Island set the limit at land valued at \u00a340 or worth an annual rent of \u00a32. Connecticut required land worth an annual rent of \u00a32 or livestock worth \u00a340...Property restrictions gradually disappeared in the nineteenth century. Tax-paying requirements replaced property ownership, though they too waned after the 1820s. By the 1850s, most economic barriers to voting had disappeared.\" This is of course mostly ignoring poll taxes, which don't speak to the proposition, but are certainly closely related. See also: [2](http://www1.cuny.edu/portal_ur/content/voting_cal/milestones.html).\n\nYou might be hinting at Jefferson, and the tension that existed between the Federalists and the Anti-federalists. Even if you are, they are by no means counter to the full proposition that it is better that white male property owners be the only ones to vote. For a fascinating account you can see [3] (http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/documents/1786-1800/the-anti-federalist-papers/qualifications-of-suffrage-%28august-7-10%29.php) for what appears to be general minutes of their debate over just this issue. As best as I can tell, they were less interested in universal suffrage, than in a) whether it was proper to enumerate this in the Constitution and b) avoiding a landed aristocracy. In whatever case, the winning side was the one who left the States to continue their property requirements. Maybe you require an affirmative statement on this issue to convince you otherwise, but for me silence after discussion is often just as telling. This is also ignoring the question of how much weight we give to the intent of someone like Madison, who, as one of the strongest architects of the Constitution, hated the idea of democracy. It is always difficult to speak of the intent of a group, but it seems there is a good historical case to build that this group was content to let property requirements continue.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "*Full disclosure: I worked at Wal-Mart for just around 2 years, and had a very positive experience. I understand that every employee has a different experience, but those I've spoken with have had no significant complaints about the company.*\n\nAt most Wal-Mart stores, there really isn't much of a feeling that a union is necessary among the employees. We would often hear stories of terrible working conditions, cheated employees, and horrific management, but those stories usually came from customers, not each other. The idea of the big evil corporate giant seemed like a fairy tale to us. Most people were just happy to get a job - they weren't qualified to work anywhere else.\n\nPart of this can be blamed on the anti-union propaganda you sit through as an employee, and yes, it does exist. It is made very clear that the company does not support unions, and that talk of unions is not taken lightly. However, as I said, it is rare to find more than one or two employees in any given store that would even feel it necessary. Nearly every store operates with a strict Open-Door policy, allowing you to express any concerns about management, pay grade, or possible corruption. In my personal experience, that system works better than any union rep I've worked with.\n\nWal-Mart's internal stance on unions is, \"why would you pay someone to protect your interests when we will allow you to protect them yourselves?\" It's a corporate line, sure, but I never witnessed any injustice that made me dismiss it.\n\nI understand that there are instances of corruption, there are poorly treated workers, and there are pay issues - but few people seem to care or understand that those are the exception, rather than the rule. Wal-Mart is an insanely huge corporation - it is really difficult to imagine just how many people work under that umbrella - so is it really surprising that there are more pockets of shit than in smaller companies?\n\n**So, to answer your question**, Wal-Mart employees don't unionize because there aren't enough of them that feel that a union is worth having.

He essentially leveled cities in Georgia in order to destroy the Confederate ability to fight.

In many instances what we are going through now is a cake walk especially when considering parents were hanged for their children's crimes in the past. It is often apparent to me that many people who say we are worse now than ever before are not up to par on their history. I have in fact gone toe-to-toe with many people on this topic who are largely ignorant to government history prior to the 1990's. \n\nThat said I am in no way trying to down play our issues today. We do as a country face injustice and hardship. The level of greed and incompetence that runs through our separate powers must be addressed or we will continue to backslide into nonsense. Will it result in armed rebellion?? I certainly hope not considering the result we had from the last one. I think many people are quick to scream for a revolution with no real understanding of what a revolution requires or results in. \n\nSo, are we worse now than ever before? No, not even close. It will do you good to keep in mind that our media has a job and that job is to create profit. Because their bottom line is based in monetary value and not social engagement most of what they say is sensationalism. Unfortunately, the only way to stay truly informed now a days is to not only read the news but cross check everything it says with historical fact. \n\nEdit: I should also note that everything I said here has to do with Domestic policy. Our foreign policy is a different story. \n\nEdit again: Also, this is the first time internet and mass technology has come into play. It was inevitable that our Governments (federal, city, and state) were going to attempt to exploit our new technical world. It is up to us to push back and that is what we are seeing right now. Nothing is permanent, not even our current state of frustration. Countries go through ups and downs and this is a current down for us.

The collective sum of Americans alive now are not made from the same stuff as our counterparts a generation or two ago. Some of us are too soft, others are lopsided too heavily towards 'individual' and not enough towards 'community', there's a deep bitter punk-like \"anti\" streak that unfortunately aligns perfectly with one of the two major parties (historically when this surfaced periodically before, it didn't cut in a way that resulted in the government gridlock like we're seeing today), etc. Might not be the worst of times, but a number of important variables are getting steadily worse. Sensationalist media aside, an accurate assessment has plenty of grim news and trends to report.\n\nWhy B: The effect of the 24 hour news cycle and mass media as a whole are definitely amplifying sensational local problems (like crime) into a perception much bigger than they are. Some trends are better (like crime dropping), some are worse (people are certainly ruder and more selfish/greedy/tribal than I remember 20 years ago), but in some ways it's a wash, made to seem worse by mass media. Also important to consider, there is a cyclical nature to many things; bad times are fixed and they become good times, in which people lose focus on what's important and things become bad again, rinse and repeat. We look back when things are getting worse and see better times in the rearview mirror, but if we look back further, past living memory, we would see they were bad before, and better before that. \n\nWhy C: Of course, that's not to say the zig-zag of the cycle is truly flatlined. Picture a graph of local temperatures over the past millenium. There is an annual tempuature zig-zag, but zoom out and the trend is gradually shifting warmer. We've been trending towards victories for being kinder, more empathetic, more intelligent and informed for centuries. The millenial kids are a better group than we gen x'ers were, IMO, and they make the old silent generation seem like a bunch of know nothing petulant punks by comparison. Whether that's truly turning around or this is just a cyclical downturn, hard to say. (I suspect the upcoming non-renewable energy crunch will be what turns the long trend downward, but that can't be known until seeing the peak of the upturn that follows our bad times now). \n\nOverall: What worries me are problems so big and complex or entrenched that the usual cyclical turns of public opinion and generational turnover won't be able to fix. Looking back at great civilizations and nations that rose and fell, they were repeatedly confronted with crisises like we have been and are now. But where they went wrong was one particular crisis era where they didn't get it together. It often weakened them to where they lingered on until being done-in by another crisis. \n\nThe things that worry me: The leviathan surveillance and drone machine that's being assembled (Skynet, J. Edgar Hoover, and the Stasi rolled into one) will be hard to dismantle, the role of money in politics, the automation tech driven devaluation of labor with no turnaround in sight, the deepening cultural divide (18th century vs 21st century), the peak-oil energy crunch (there's no good replacement for oil in terms of energy output per energy to extract/generate), etc. We have some real severe problems, and it doesn't look like we have the  leverage, insight, and willpower to fix them. \n\nBut I wouldn't let it affect the outlook on whether to have kids or start a family. Humans are very resilient and adaptable. While we'll always be hobbled by the memory and experience of living in better times, kids born into hard times  naturally see them as normal, and will be very well suited to navigating it. Not to mention that having kids is a great safety net when age starts to pile on the problems (50+). While times are hard now, the under 40 crowd (and especially the under 30 crowd) is handling it much better than the over 40s and over 50s (exhibit A: the drastically increasing suicide rate among the over 40s). So the as-yet unborn kids will be alright, and they'll bail our gray butts out if we let them. \n\nEDIT: switched a word in the \"Why B\" paragraph.
