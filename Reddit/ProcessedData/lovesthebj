{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I'll try to continue this dialogue, though I fear getting in over my head.  \n\n[This article](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115509/elizabeth-warren-hillary-clintons-nightmare) does an excellent job of detailing Elizabeth Warrens rise to prominence and her contrasts with Hillary Clinton. \n\nIn summary, there is a clear schism in the GOP between establishment republicans and the maverick Tea Party, but there is an emergent divide on the left between establishment Democrats who are close to business and the liberal wing of the party that defines themselves in the issue of income inequality.  Elizabeth Warren has garnered headlines by openly challenging Wall Street, challenging toothless regulators and confronting both republicans and democrats who have failed to protect the poor and middle class.  She is respectful to her Senate colleagues but is also vocal about the issues she champions, and as a member of the banking committee she has a very powerful position.  \n\nShe has been outspoken about the failure of regulation, the abuses of Wall Street, the minimum wage and the crippling debt of students and the poor.  The thinking is that without a war like Iraq to debate and with the ACA being law those financial issues are going to be central in the next election.\n\nShe throws heat, she's outspoken, she's been bold in committee calling out people that democrats usually treat with kid gloves.  She's well-liked in the senate, even as she's seen to be a bit unpredictable.  Women like her, though polls are scarce right now.\n\nAlternatively, she's only been in the senate for a year, and by the time a real campaign could kick off in 2015 she'd only have three years of legislative experience.  She's a junior senator in a very democratic state, she has no noteworthy body of accomplishment, no signature piece of legislation to champion, she won't even have much of a voting record to run on.  Hillary Clinton already has a huge superPac lined up and precinct captains all over the country waiting for her to announce.  Warren has no ground game in place, no experienced campaign staff, no fundraising apparatus in place.  These things can all be built, but she'd be at a disadvantage to someone like Hillary, who seems to have all the establishment support right now.  Politics is money, and Warren doesn't have any and she isn't sucking up to the big revenue generators.  There's time, but she'd be a huge long-shot.  Its likely that sometime during the primary season we'll get a look at a strong, compelling Democratic Governor who can get support from most of the left, and try to let the right divide itself.  That's what I meant in my last comment.  I like her, I like her outspoken style and I like her politics, but she's very much a long shot.  Very similar circumstances to Obama.  \n\nLastly, there's noise right now that she'd support a Hillary campaign, that the two have a mutual respect, and its possible Clinton-Warren could be a very interesting ticket.  Elizabeth Warren could be a very powerful and persuasive Vice Presidential candidate.", "id": "t1_cdg5j3w", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "lovesthebj", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1qsqg8", "id": "t1_cdg74hp", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "leon_everest", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdg8bls", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "unorignal_name", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1qsqg8", "id": "t1_cdgh341", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "TooTurnt", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdgi4kp", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "unorignal_name", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cdgh341", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428621903, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I disagree about Warren.

This will dramatically affect the primaries, because President Clinton played a large role jn establishing the very system that Warren wants to change. Inevitably, the more Warren is a part of the discussion around 2016, the more Hillary will be forced to address these issues and the progressive base will not be satisfied by her answers. \n\nThat being said, I don't even think Warren will run in the end, but she will shape the discussion. \n\nAs for a potential Hillary running-mate, I agree that right now it would seem likely she'll go for a governor that polls well among independents and moderates. Obviously from a swing state they could carry. Jay Nixon fits that description perfectly. His crossover voting in 2012 (i. e. people that voted for Romney and Nixon) was ridiculous, and his polling numbers are generally amazing. He balanced the budget several consecutive years, etc etc, got everything in this category going for him, and he could could help win a state that Romney won by like 17 points. Problem is, progressives will hate him. He's too blue dog. \n\nAlso, keep an eye on Martin O'Malley. He'll run, and he'll run way left of Hillary. \n\nEdit: So I was wrong.

It's been referred to as the Reagan Rule, the Eleventh Commandment and the Reagan Doctrine in media, and I took the time to highlight the applicable portion for context.  Debate, but don't be pedantic.\n\n&gt;Unwritten rule? There are many theories floating around that say candidates should use a primary to get all the worst press/ attacks out.\n\nThis has been the pattern lately, where candidates in primary campaigns have fought so hard against each other that they damage their chances on the main stage.  Obama and Hillary stayed clear of most of that, the most damaging things they lobbied at each other were the \"3am phone call\" campaign.  Meanwhile the Republicans were destroying each other until only McCain, who started out as a long-shot, was left.  And then they repeated this action in the last election where Republicans like Bachman and Perry tried to tear down Romney, and dragged the primary out for so long, that by the time the national campaign started he was already badly damaged and didn't have the support of the conservative right.  How many times did we hear 'I'll hold my nose and vote for Romney'?\n\n&gt;It seems as if you think it wouldn\u2019t be bad if Hillary were tied to the Clinton Era.\n\nI really couldn't say, it's a matter of spin.  I think everyone from the 90s takes way too much credit for the economic success, the same way current Republicans seem to deify Reagan.  It's a way to take credit for the good things and gloss over the bad.\n\n&gt;Of course I\u2019ve been reductive, but as it stands the Clintons came out clear and clean. Bring on whitewater.\n\nClear of charges, not necessarily clear and clean in reputation, but then how can you account for her significant unfavorable ratings 7 years ago?  How can you account for her losing to Obama?\n\n&gt;Perhaps it wasn\u2019t clear that I was referring to New York State polls? It seems as if you responded as if they were national polls, as you used a national figure to respond to my state figure. The idea was to show that the people in NY didn\u2019t necessarily like her, she wasn\u2019t from NY, she was seen as riding off her husbands coat tails, but when people saw her in action they liked her very much.\n\nThanks for clarifying your numbers.  Again, though, I don't think it's that hard to build a good reputation as a liberal in New York, and while any transplant candidate starts behind the 8 ball, she was elected - therefore succeeding in the only poll that matters - and worked hard.  I have no problem with her record in New York, but every candidate that runs for President is popular in their home state.  \n\n&gt;I\u2019m sure there are many feminists who would not take kindly to that remark. Why is it that men find it so difficult to talk about women\u2019s issues? Abortion?\n\nI strongly disagree.  If a feminist position or advocacy were considered controversial *that* would the insult to feminists, as if implying that a women's right or a family benefit was somehow an extraordinary outlier.  Women's rights are widely acknowledged, and any attack on women's rights is huge news.  Consider either Texas or the congressional recent panel of white, male, republicans who debated women's contraception, without a woman in the room.  These were huge stories that hurt the Republicans on the national stage.  Taking a position *against* women's reproductive health, women's right to choose, pay inequality, children's health, benefits and subsidies for families, etc, would **rightly** be controversial and draw ridicule and possibly alienate a large and powerful demographic.  It's much like gay marriage among democrats.  The safe position is now to support gay rights, and the unpopular opinion is to delay or deny those rights.  Feminists should rightly celebrate that women's rights are now the mainstream, and that advocating on their behalf is the safe, popular position, and attacking or withholding women's rights is the unpopular position.  Feminists win when their causes are seen as safe, unassailable and inviolate and when anyone seeks to deny them is seen as a bigot.\n\n[Consider recent Huffington/Fox News poll](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/polls/fox-17613)\n\nClinton 56/38, good numbers but less than 5 percent undecided.\n\nChris Christie 46/20, (and I think we agree, a very small chance of succeeding in the Republican party) but 21% never heard of and 13% undecided.

How do you account for her loss to Obama?  How do you account for her still-high unfavorable ratings, years before she'd have to start building a campaign?

I like her.  I like her as a person and as a candidate, but you can't ignore that Republicans hate her, that she espouses every position they would fight tooth and nail to defeat, that she would absolutely radicalize the right.  She's a pro-choice, pro gun-control, pro-healthcare, pro-gay rights liberal who will appoint liberal judges and political appointees, and *she's not even a particularly liberal person/politician!*  She's close to a moderate on most issues but she's still blindingly left to anyone on the right.\n\n&gt;But are people going to want to go back in the dumpster and pick out the trash that we were seeing 24 hours a day and reached some sort of consensus on in the 90s?\n\nI think it's foolish to think that they wouldn't when you consider how they attacked Kerry and McCain for Vietnam-era issues.

Debate, but don't be pedantic.\n\n&gt;Unwritten rule? There are many theories floating around that say candidates should use a primary to get all the worst press/ attacks out.\n\nThis has been the pattern lately, where candidates in primary campaigns have fought so hard against each other that they damage their chances on the main stage.  Obama and Hillary stayed clear of most of that, the most damaging things they lobbied at each other were the \"3am phone call\" campaign.  Meanwhile the Republicans were destroying each other until only McCain, who started out as a long-shot, was left.  And then they repeated this action in the last election where Republicans like Bachman and Perry tried to tear down Romney, and dragged the primary out for so long, that by the time the national campaign started he was already badly damaged and didn't have the support of the conservative right.  How many times did we hear 'I'll hold my nose and vote for Romney'?\n\n&gt;It seems as if you think it wouldn\u2019t be bad if Hillary were tied to the Clinton Era.\n\nI really couldn't say, it's a matter of spin.  I think everyone from the 90s takes way too much credit for the economic success, the same way current Republicans seem to deify Reagan.  It's a way to take credit for the good things and gloss over the bad.\n\n&gt;Of course I\u2019ve been reductive, but as it stands the Clintons came out clear and clean. Bring on whitewater.\n\nClear of charges, not necessarily clear and clean in reputation, but then how can you account for her significant unfavorable ratings 7 years ago?  How can you account for her losing to Obama?\n\n&gt;Perhaps it wasn\u2019t clear that I was referring to New York State polls? It seems as if you responded as if they were national polls, as you used a national figure to respond to my state figure. The idea was to show that the people in NY didn\u2019t necessarily like her, she wasn\u2019t from NY, she was seen as riding off her husbands coat tails, but when people saw her in action they liked her very much.\n\nThanks for clarifying your numbers.  Again, though, I don't think it's that hard to build a good reputation as a liberal in New York, and while any transplant candidate starts behind the 8 ball, she was elected - therefore succeeding in the only poll that matters - and worked hard.  I have no problem with her record in New York, but every candidate that runs for President is popular in their home state.  \n\n&gt;I\u2019m sure there are many feminists who would not take kindly to that remark. Why is it that men find it so difficult to talk about women\u2019s issues? Abortion?\n\nI strongly disagree.  If a feminist position or advocacy were considered controversial *that* would the insult to feminists, as if implying that a women's right or a family benefit was somehow an extraordinary outlier.  Women's rights are widely acknowledged, and any attack on women's rights is huge news.  Consider either Texas or the congressional recent panel of white, male, republicans who debated women's contraception, without a woman in the room.  These were huge stories that hurt the Republicans on the national stage.  Taking a position *against* women's reproductive health, women's right to choose, pay inequality, children's health, benefits and subsidies for families, etc, would **rightly** be controversial and draw ridicule and possibly alienate a large and powerful demographic.  It's much like gay marriage among democrats.  The safe position is now to support gay rights, and the unpopular opinion is to delay or deny those rights.

There are many theories floating around that say candidates should use a primary to get all the worst press/ attacks out.

One of the things that the Democratic Party points out in the DFA and OFA trainings is that they have essentially used two campaign slogans going back to 1976, when the Dem Party had completely changed their primary process under the McGovern/ Fraser Commission. The readers digest version is that if a Democratic candidate comes after another Democratic president or a time of eceonomc prosperity then that candidate will run on continuation, and if the candidate was running against a CREEP (Campaign to Reelect the President,) then that candidate will run on change.

To be clear, I was saying that a consensus has already been reached on these subjects many years ago and she came out looking pretty clean. There could be a chance that people will try to bring up all the old bad blood, but she has the ability to define herself another way and win the argument. For example, she could take her new foundation, No Ceilings, and create a much larger name for herself as a women\u2019s rights leader. Then try talking to the stately women\u2019s rights leader about her husbands infidelity, the talking points write themselves. My larger point was that American presidential elections are about defining yourself and the other candidate. \n\n\n\n-I haven't seen any numbers for her that jumped that high in or around 2006, do you have a source? Most polls at that time had her favorable/unfavorable around 52-54/39-43\n\nPerhaps it wasn\u2019t clear that I was referring to New York State polls?

Potentially.\n\nThe Lewinski talk strengthens women\u2019s support for Hillary, just look at her national numbers after 1998, she got a huge boost. Many say that they agreed with her decision, or found that it was her own private decision not to be appraised, but as Maya Angelou said, \u201cI watched her show what it was like to be a woman in distress and difficulty. I watched her as she was on the front pages of every journal in the world. And I watched her stand.\u201d Most women agree with Dr. Angelou and would find an ad about Bill Clinton\u2019s infidelity to be repulsive and old news. Which, I just must add, if having a good marriage is a prerequisite for running for high office, there would have been many issues in the past/ present.  \n\n", "edited": 1384711698, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1qsqg8", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdggl71", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384711223", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdgd7a4", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428623601, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdgehkr", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384705554", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}

We all know Rand Paul isn\u2019t a licensed ophthalmologist, but licensed himself, and Rubio is probably from outer space. \nWe know Hillary, she\u2019s a national name, she has been through the freak show and survived. We don\u2019t know anything about the other candidates AND they aren\u2019t national figures. Even Christie is going to have a very hard time making himself a national candidate.\n\nOPs question didn't have anything to do with the Republican candidates, and you're getting a bit silly at the end of too-long a debate.  I don't think Christie can survive the Republican primary season for the same reason Hillary will have a hard time, his kind of popularity can't stand up to the kind of scrutiny he'll receive as a national candidate.

It's been referred to as the Reagan Rule, the Eleventh Commandment and the Reagan Doctrine in media, and I took the time to highlight the applicable portion for context.  Debate, but don't be pedantic.\n\n&gt;Unwritten rule? There are many theories floating around that say candidates should use a primary to get all the worst press/ attacks out.\n\nThis has been the pattern lately, where candidates in primary campaigns have fought so hard against each other that they damage their chances on the main stage.  Obama and Hillary stayed clear of most of that, the most damaging things they lobbied at each other were the \"3am phone call\" campaign.  Meanwhile the Republicans were destroying each other until only McCain, who started out as a long-shot, was left.  And then they repeated this action in the last election where Republicans like Bachman and Perry tried to tear down Romney, and dragged the primary out for so long, that by the time the national campaign started he was already badly damaged and didn't have the support of the conservative right.  How many times did we hear 'I'll hold my nose and vote for Romney'?\n\n&gt;It seems as if you think it wouldn\u2019t be bad if Hillary were tied to the Clinton Era.\n\nI really couldn't say, it's a matter of spin.  I think everyone from the 90s takes way too much credit for the economic success, the same way current Republicans seem to deify Reagan.  It's a way to take credit for the good things and gloss over the bad.\n\n&gt;Of course I\u2019ve been reductive, but as it stands the Clintons came out clear and clean. Bring on whitewater.\n\nClear of charges, not necessarily clear and clean in reputation, but then how can you account for her significant unfavorable ratings 7 years ago?  How can you account for her losing to Obama?\n\n&gt;Perhaps it wasn\u2019t clear that I was referring to New York State polls? It seems as if you responded as if they were national polls, as you used a national figure to respond to my state figure. The idea was to show that the people in NY didn\u2019t necessarily like her, she wasn\u2019t from NY, she was seen as riding off her husbands coat tails, but when people saw her in action they liked her very much.\n\nThanks for clarifying your numbers.  Again, though, I don't think it's that hard to build a good reputation as a liberal in New York, and while any transplant candidate starts behind the 8 ball, she was elected - therefore succeeding in the only poll that matters - and worked hard.  I have no problem with her record in New York, but every candidate that runs for President is popular in their home state.  \n\n&gt;I\u2019m sure there are many feminists who would not take kindly to that remark. Why is it that men find it so difficult to talk about women\u2019s issues? Abortion?\n\nI strongly disagree.  If a feminist position or advocacy were considered controversial *that* would the insult to feminists, as if implying that a women's right or a family benefit was somehow an extraordinary outlier.  Women's rights are widely acknowledged, and any attack on women's rights is huge news.  Consider either Texas or the congressional recent panel of white, male, republicans who debated women's contraception, without a woman in the room.  These were huge stories that hurt the Republicans on the national stage.  Taking a position *against* women's reproductive health, women's right to choose, pay inequality, children's health, benefits and subsidies for families, etc, would **rightly** be controversial and draw ridicule and possibly alienate a large and powerful demographic.  It's much like gay marriage among democrats.  The safe position is now to support gay rights, and the unpopular opinion is to delay or deny those rights.  Feminists should rightly celebrate that women's rights are now the mainstream, and that advocating on their behalf is the safe, popular position, and attacking or withholding women's rights is the unpopular position.  Feminists win when their causes are seen as safe, unassailable and inviolate and when anyone seeks to deny them is seen as a bigot.\n\n[Consider recent Huffington/Fox News poll](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/polls/fox-17613)\n\nClinton 56/38, good numbers but less than 5 percent undecided.\n\nChris Christie 46/20, (and I think we agree, a very small chance of succeeding in the Republican party) but 21% never heard of and 13% undecided.  That's a lot of minds available to be changed and if they break roughly in half he's looking at 60/40, or similar to Hillary's numbers.\n\nHow many minds are available for her to change when she has such a low undecided return?  \n\nTo be clear, for I think the third time, I like her, I think she could win against a number of the potential Republican opponents and be a good President, even in her 70s, but I responded to OP's question fairly, and detailed what I think are her weaknesses.  I think if you were honest you'd have to acknowledge some of them too.  Somewhere, in a safe or a burn bag, there's an opposition prep report that the Clinton campaign had made in 2006 detailing all of her weakness, every old skeleton that the media or the Republicans would find and drag out on the national stage, and I'm sure that folder was much, much larger than my little post here.\n\nYour argument seems to be that her cons are either not applicable or are old news and therefore have no significance in an upcoming national election.  You've argued my points, but how do you respond to OP's original question.  What do you think are the cons (we know what your pro opinions are) of a Hillary campaign or Presidency?  How do you account for her loss to Obama?  How do you account for her still-high unfavorable ratings, years before she'd have to start building a campaign?  How do you account for her massive drops in popularity every time news comes out about Benghazi?

There are many theories floating around that say candidates should use a primary to get all the worst press/ attacks out. The idea is that if one faces allegations soon and head on it will be less detrimental in a general election. One always wants to keep bad press as far away from election day as possible.

There are few people left that don't have an opinion on Hillary\n\nHillary can\u2019t run on hope and change, partly because the Democratic Party would not want her to. One of the things that the Democratic Party points out in the DFA and OFA trainings is that they have essentially used two campaign slogans going back to 1976, when the Dem Party had completely changed their primary process under the McGovern/ Fraser Commission. The readers digest version is that if a Democratic candidate comes after another Democratic president or a time of eceonomc prosperity then that candidate will run on continuation, and if the candidate was running against a CREEP (Campaign to Reelect the President,) then that candidate will run on change.

To be clear, I was saying that a consensus has already been reached on these subjects many years ago and she came out looking pretty clean. There could be a chance that people will try to bring up all the old bad blood, but she has the ability to define herself another way and win the argument. For example, she could take her new foundation, No Ceilings, and create a much larger name for herself as a women\u2019s rights leader. Then try talking to the stately women\u2019s rights leader about her husbands infidelity, the talking points write themselves. My larger point was that American presidential elections are about defining yourself and the other candidate. \n\n\n\n-I haven't seen any numbers for her that jumped that high in or around 2006, do you have a source? Most polls at that time had her favorable/unfavorable around 52-54/39-43\n\nPerhaps it wasn\u2019t clear that I was referring to New York State polls?

Potentially.\n\nThe Lewinski talk strengthens women\u2019s support for Hillary, just look at her national numbers after 1998, she got a huge boost. Many say that they agreed with her decision, or found that it was her own private decision not to be appraised, but as Maya Angelou said, \u201cI watched her show what it was like to be a woman in distress and difficulty. I watched her as she was on the front pages of every journal in the world. And I watched her stand.\u201d Most women agree with Dr. Angelou and would find an ad about Bill Clinton\u2019s infidelity to be repulsive and old news. Which, I just must add, if having a good marriage is a prerequisite for running for high office, there would have been many issues in the past/ present.  \n\n", "edited": 1384711698, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1qsqg8", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdggl71", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384711223", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdgd7a4", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428623601, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdgehkr", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384705554", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdg7s6d", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428624201, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Democratic field was trying to follow the Reagan Doctrine?

Hillary was all over journals around the world. It must be mentioned that Ken Star and the Republicans set up a $76 million apparatus completely dedicating to destroying Bill and Hillary, but we still had a balanced budget, peace, and over threw a dictator in Haiti. Whitewater was earlier mentioned. So, Ken had decided he wanted to nail Hillary on whitewater, because after all the freak show he had turned nothing else up. Hillary could have testified in the white house concerning whitewater, as did Bill testify in the white house concerning Lewinski, BUT they had to drag Hillary into a federal court building. I still remember the first question Ken asked her, \u201cMrs. Clinton, is there any other place you would rather be today?\u201d A huge smile came over Hillary\u2019s face and she said, \u201cOh! I can think of about a million other places.\u201d It turned up that nothing was found concerning whitewater, just that Jim Mcdougal was a shady character. Even in those moments of that seemingly intractable situation, Hillary rises above with grace and dignity.  My argument on this point is that we know EVEYTHING about Hillary already; she has been in the public eye since 1972. I will give you that Hillary\u2019s goal this time would be to define herself quickly and strongly, but that\u2019s what every presidential election is about. And this isn\u2019t a Hillary problem, this is a running for president problem, everyone has it. But are people going to want to go back in the dumpster and pick out the trash that we were seeing 24 hours a day and reached some sort of consensus on in the 90s? The only people who are not aware of these issues or haven\u2019t had them hammered into her brain for years would be people in the 20s currently.

And that\u2019s coming out of NY! \n\nI haven't seen any numbers for her that jumped that high in or around 2006, do you have a source?  Most polls at that time had her favorable/unfavorable around 52-54/39-43.  That unfavorable number is key, it's considered dangerous to try to run a national campaign if your unfavorable rating is higher than 40 unless your favorable number is much higher, and they hidden number is how many are undecided.  As you refer below, Hillary is very much a known quantity, very few people don't have a strong opinion of her.  Also, she got those numbers being a Senator in a very blue state, working with the most senior and possibly most powerful democrat in the Senate, during a time when the sitting President was becoming more and more unpopular.\n\nI agree that her numbers have gotten steadily higher since then, with the exception of losing the DNC primary which, considering she's only run one national campaign is really the only poll you need.  She wasn't a hypothetical candidate.  She ran and the Democrats chose someone else.  She's 0-1 on the national stage, and it wasn't for lack of trying.  Early in that primary season she was the presumptive nominee.\n\n&gt;Hillary\u2019s numbers are and have been stellar since 2006. So, I don\u2019t think any thinking person can deny her insane popularity or make the argument that she is polarizing because she was not popular in the 90s. Give me a break.\n\nHer numbers have been excellent since 2006, but that's partly because the legacy of former presidents improves as we get farther from it (Consider both the popularity of Reagan and Clinton now compared to the ends or low points of their Presidencies).  Also, there tends to be a strong statistical bump for former Secretaries of State.  Rice and Powell both enjoyed unprecedented popularity during and after their term at State.  Does that popularity continue into a national campaign?  Hard to say, I don't have a precedent at hand.  Part of that popularity stems from the fact that the State department takes no position on domestic issues, so you get the popularity of an important national position without being dragged down into the mud of daily politics.\n\n&gt;I do not understand how Hillary could be seen as an extension of the 90s Clinton era. \n\nI don't understand how you couldn't.\n\n&gt;Rosalynn Carter sat in on meetings with the chiefs of staff, Eleanor Roosevelt is obviously famous for her political involvement, Nancy Reagan was also involved in public debate and selection of her husband\u2019s advisors.  \n\nNone of those people, none, have ever run for national office after their husband left the White House.  I don't know how you could try to draw that comparison.  Every first lady since Jackie has had a national profile and cause celebre, but few were seen as the political force that got their husband elected and helped run his White House.  There's a reason that former Presidents are seldom seen weighing in on national issues.  They all retain a respectful privacy, not engaging in debate or undermining the current President.  In this case the former President would either be front and center on all issues or conspicuously absent, and Bill Clinton doesn't like being left out of the debate and he *really* doesn't like people attacking his wife.\n\n&gt;The partner of the president is a very strange, unelected position, which leaves the power of the position completely up to the individual. There will always be questions about the president\u2019s partner in a highly political environment.\n\nI agree, she would have to face those questions.\n\n&gt;Hillary was not in the military, but I\u2019m very curious as to why that would matter. Many presidents have not had \u201cmilitary experience.\u201d Hillary did, though, sit on the Armed Services committee when she was in the senate. That is not to mention the type of experience she would have gained being secretary of state.\n\nI agree, and I addressed this in another post below, and the American people are often willing to accept positions like State and key committee positions as executive experience relating to the military.  But unless she runs against someone with no war record or military experience the questions would absolutely come up, as they've come up in nearly every presidential election in recent memory.  The likelihood of her running against someone without a strong military history increases all the time, since Vietnam was too long ago and Iraq too recent, but it is almost always a campaign issue. \n\n&gt;Don\u2019t let the 90s distract you, Hillary\u2019s central issues all of her life have been women and girls. Do you not remember the \u201cit takes a village\u201d speech from the 1996 DNC? Not to mention the work with the children\u2019s defense fund, etc.\n\nI agree, I don't think I ever questioned her commitment to women's groups and family.  I read It Takes a Village and very much enjoyed it.\n\n&gt;People are tired of the same old political gags. \n\nThis is absolutely not true, and I'd ask you to support that proposition.  People say they are tired of those gags, but when you see the kind of bullshit that makes it's way into national politics you realize people eat that shit up.  Obama and drugs, the birther movement, the Tea Party holding government hostage, Anthony Weiner and Elliot Spitzer.  The American people say they have little tolerance for these things and then viewership and readership go through the roof.  \n\n&gt;The only reasons we ever talked about Vince Foster or whitewater was because republicans could not defeat Bill politically, so they tried to defeat him personally and Ken Star was running dry on Lewinski.\n\nThat's a bit of shuffling of the chronology.  The Whitewater controversy was an issue in 1992 and came to prominence in Bill Clinton's first campaign and term (in an era before the kind of internet we have now, and before the 24-hr news cycle), Filegate was in 1996, and the Lewinsky scandal was 1998.  I agree Ken Starr tried to dig up skeletons in an ill-advised attempt to extend his prosecution of the Clintons, but those scandals predated Lewinsky.\n\n&gt;Hillary hasn\u2019t stood up for difficult issues? I hope that it doesn\u2019t imply that women, children, education, and healthcare are safe issues. It\u2019s sort of like when old southern men call those issues, \u201cfemale/ soft issues.\u201d\n\nFrankly, they are safe issues.  When has a politician fallen out of favor advocating on behalf of women, children, education and health?  Those issues are universal, they are unimpeachable except when arguing about funding and privacy, and anyone who attacks you on those issues risks alienating key demographics.  Advocating for families is probably the most 'safe' position you can take.  \n\n&gt;I\u2019m sorry, but in 2013 it is very cheap to use Lewinski. [...] I think bringing up Bill\u2019s infidelity and her choice not to divorce him might upset a lot of women voters, just saying.\n\nCheap?  Absolutely.  Will it alienate women voters?  Potentially.  Though if Hillary's numbers stayed as strong with women as they are now there might not be an undecided women left.  If she took 75% of women the way Obama overwhelmingly carried blacks, and the remaining 25% of women were firm Republican that already thought of her unfavorably, painting her with scandal might not move the needle among women and might draw out more Republican men and family values minorities like Latinos.  Hard to say, the RNC would run a thousand polls before getting dirty in those areas, but the Heritage Foundation or the Koch brothers?  With their own money and their own axe to grind and who absolutely hate Bill Clinton and would love to see him torn down?

This is easier to do when you have military or executive experience.\n\nAll that to say, I agree with your position, but within the context of OP's original question 'What would the pros and cons of a Hillary campaign be' I tried to list those aspects of her record she would have to address or compensate for.  It's just easier to enter those debates, and the debate your VP has on your behalf, if you can say 'when I was Governor we...' or 'when I served we...' or 'When I was at the Pentagon...'.

Bush's national guard experience and lack of more prominent military experience during a time when he could have served, was a key campaign issue when he  ran both times.  Bill Clinton's lack of military experience and his great efforts to avoid the draft in his youth were absolutely critical campaign issues when running against a war veterans in George H.W. Bush and Bob Dole.\n\nFurther, there are a number of positions that the American people typically accept as similar enough to military experience so as to be qualified.  Working at the Pentagon, or in the Defense Department, positions with any of the key intelligence services, Senate Oversight, Ways and Means, Armed Services, Military Affairs or Appropriations, and I would argue, State.  I think one could reasonably argue that running the State department entails a lot of the same responsibilities as, say, a Joint Chief, in that you manage the safety and security of Americans in dangerous and hostile environments and enforce the President's foreign policy.\n\nI don't think it's central to a candidate's qualification for President, but I think it's almost always an issue unless you're running against someone who also doesn't have military experiences.

This is easier to do when you have military or executive experience.\n\nAll that to say, I agree with your position, but within the context of OP's original question 'What would the pros and cons of a Hillary campaign be' I tried to list those aspects of her record she would have to address or compensate for.  It's just easier to enter those debates, and the debate your VP has on your behalf, if you can say 'when I was Governor we...' or 'when I served we...' or 'When I was at the Pentagon...'.  Obama's second campaign, for example, focused quite a bit on Libya and Bin Laden, while the first campaign held close to blaming Bush for Iraq without getting too far into his own feelings about service. \n\nMilitary service is like being from a state with a healthy economy.  It's not essential to winning, but it can make things a bit easier.\n\nWe've so far ignored the more sexist motivations of people who might decide not to vote for her.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I'll just respond briefly, so that other, smarter people can give a more complete answer. \n\nThe pros of a Hillary presidency would be that she would likely be the most qualified President in recent memory.  Most agree she has a stirling intellect, that she was the driving force and political mind behind her husbands career.  She doesn't have military experience but certainly has an exceptional grasp of foreign policy matters due to heading the State Dept and she was her husband's closest counsel when he was president and commander in chief.  She has a multitude of Democratic allies and earned a lot of respect from senior Dems from her time as First Lady and her time spent as a Senator in New York.  She was known as an exceptionally hard working Junior Senator that was more than willing to work tirelessly on issues but to share or defer credit.  She has a complete understanding or Washington business and Washington politics.\n\nCons, she's incredibly polarizing.  Her presidency would be seen as an extension of the Bill Clinton era, and many would believe that he would wield undue influence in the White House.  She has no military experience and would face prejudice as the first female commander-in-chief.  The already intractable Republicans would become more adversarial, if that we're possible.  Her signature cause when she was First Lady was healthcare, and she made plenty of enemies in the 90s on that issue, including allegations she was dramatically overstepping her role as first lady and actually coordinating a health care task force.  She'd have to answer a lot of questions about the Whitewater Sandal, again, and she'd have to answer for a lot of the criminal prosecutions of former Clinton staffers and appointments.  She's seen as someone who prefers regulation but will side with business over the consumer, alienating some on the left.  She has a reputation for supporting causes that are politically popular or safe regardless of merit, and a conspicuous silence on matters that are more controversial, as well as a reputation for being ruthless and uncompromising to people who are not clear allies.  And her apparent ignorance of her husbands multiple affairs divides her among women.  Even after the humiliation of the Lewinski scandal her support of her husband was seen as political, a divorce not been seen as devastating to their political futures.  The fact that he runs his business out of Brooklyn and she's been travelling the world as Secretary of State suggests that they are married in name only, though things might have changed as they've aged.  Finally, Bill Clinton is at his best in small doses, as he tends to overwhelm any conversation and doesn't shy away from microphones or cameras.  It would be very difficult to keep his presence out of Washington and the media if she were President.\n\nSo, In my opinion she is very qualified, but extremely polarizing.  Her unfavourableness would've higher than anyone else running.  She is distrusted on the left and hated on the right.  An excellent politician and political mind, the very definition of a Washington insider, but one no Republican could ever be caught working with. She has a lot of dirt in her past, to contrast against her glowing resume, and if she tries to run on her husbands accomplishments she invites his scandals as well.  \n\nI don't know who the other democrats are that could run in 2016.  Obama was, forgive the pun, the dark horse early in his first primary.  You have to see who puts themselves out there, what their campaigns are, how they debate, they have to be vetted by the media before I'd try to guess who could win in 2016 or who would be a good president.

Elizabeth Warren has garnered headlines by openly challenging Wall Street, challenging toothless regulators and confronting both republicans and democrats who have failed to protect the poor and middle class.  She is respectful to her Senate colleagues but is also vocal about the issues she champions, and as a member of the banking committee she has a very powerful position.  \n\nShe has been outspoken about the failure of regulation, the abuses of Wall Street, the minimum wage and the crippling debt of students and the poor.  The thinking is that without a war like Iraq to debate and with the ACA being law those financial issues are going to be central in the next election.\n\nShe throws heat, she's outspoken, she's been bold in committee calling out people that democrats usually treat with kid gloves.  She's well-liked in the senate, even as she's seen to be a bit unpredictable.  Women like her, though polls are scarce right now.\n\nAlternatively, she's only been in the senate for a year, and by the time a real campaign could kick off in 2015 she'd only have three years of legislative experience.  She's a junior senator in a very democratic state, she has no noteworthy body of accomplishment, no signature piece of legislation to champion, she won't even have much of a voting record to run on.  Hillary Clinton already has a huge superPac lined up and precinct captains all over the country waiting for her to announce.  Warren has no ground game in place, no experienced campaign staff, no fundraising apparatus in place.  These things can all be built, but she'd be at a disadvantage to someone like Hillary, who seems to have all the establishment support right now.  Politics is money, and Warren doesn't have any and she isn't sucking up to the big revenue generators.  There's time, but she'd be a huge long-shot.  Its likely that sometime during the primary season we'll get a look at a strong, compelling Democratic Governor who can get support from most of the left, and try to let the right divide itself.  That's what I meant in my last comment.  I like her, I like her outspoken style and I like her politics, but she's very much a long shot.  Very similar circumstances to Obama.  \n\nLastly, there's noise right now that she'd support a Hillary campaign, that the two have a mutual respect, and its possible Clinton-Warren could be a very interesting ticket.  Elizabeth Warren could be a very powerful and persuasive Vice Presidential candidate.", "id": "t1_cdg5j3w", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "lovesthebj", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1qsqg8", "id": "t1_cdg74hp", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "leon_everest", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdg8bls", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "unorignal_name", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1qsqg8", "id": "t1_cdgh341", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "TooTurnt", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdgi4kp", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "unorignal_name", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cdgh341", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428621903, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I disagree about Warren.

This will dramatically affect the primaries, because President Clinton played a large role jn establishing the very system that Warren wants to change. Inevitably, the more Warren is a part of the discussion around 2016, the more Hillary will be forced to address these issues and the progressive base will not be satisfied by her answers. \n\nThat being said, I don't even think Warren will run in the end, but she will shape the discussion. \n\nAs for a potential Hillary running-mate, I agree that right now it would seem likely she'll go for a governor that polls well among independents and moderates. Obviously from a swing state they could carry. Jay Nixon fits that description perfectly. His crossover voting in 2012 (i. e. people that voted for Romney and Nixon) was ridiculous, and his polling numbers are generally amazing. He balanced the budget several consecutive years, etc etc, got everything in this category going for him, and he could could help win a state that Romney won by like 17 points. Problem is, progressives will hate him. He's too blue dog. \n\nAlso, keep an eye on Martin O'Malley. He'll run, and he'll run way left of Hillary. \n\nEdit: So I was wrong.

Hillary Clinton's popularity is far from universal, every potential candidate has strikes against them - there are *no* sure things in politics - and her last national campaign flamed out spectacularly and that was during a run against a democratic field intent on establishing themselves but trying very hard to follow the Reagan doctrine, thou shalt not speak ill of a fellow [Republican].  \n\nShe didn't get the beating from Republicans she'd get in a national campaign, because she's never been the nominee, and while I'm sure she's tough enough to take it, it would get very dirty.

How much did we hear about Rev. Wright, Bill Ayers, and Weather Underground?  Christ, the Republicans managed to discredit a war hero in Kerry with \"Swift-boating\".  George Bush eliminated John McCain by painting him as an angry ex-pow intent on restarting the war in Vietnam.  I mean, they made Joe the Plumber a national celebrity.

It does the party no good to attack your opponent so broadly that you do all the opposition's work for them, especially since opposition SuperPACs are already at work using ads to undermine candidates.\n\n&gt;Do you think Hillary hasn\u2019t seen dirty? [Summary of some Clinton Era Scandals] \n\nOf course she has, that's to her benefit but also her detriment.  Obama won on hope and change, partly because he wasn't a known quantity.  There are few people left that don't have an opinion on Hillary.  I'm not worried that *she* can't stand up to the mud slinging, she's tough as nails and extremely smart, but can her campaign be successful?  \n\n&gt;Also, it must be mentioned that Ken Star and the Republicans set up a $76 million apparatus completely dedicating to destroying Bill and Hillary, but we still had a balanced budget, peace, and overthrew a dictator in Haiti.\n\nWe did have a balanced budget, though Bill Clinton and the democrats take much, much more credit for that than they deserve.  We had an entirely new industry created out of absolutely nothing, it touched commerce, manufacturing, import/export, and its genesis was effectively local to the US.  The rise of the internet and the personal computer era is almost unprecedented in history, to have such a dominating market force arise out of almost nothing and to grow exponentially in such a short time.  Anyone who was president at the time was going to reap the benefit of the market growing so dramatically, and with the Gulf War ending before Clinton took office, the country was suddenly rich and getting richer.  \n\n&gt;It turned up that nothing was found concerning whitewater, just that Jim Mcdougal was a shady character.\n\nThat's a bit reductive.  A lot of people were criminally charged and at best lost their jobs and went broke defending themselves.  McDougal flipped on the Clintons to get a shorter prison sentence and still died in jail.  They couldn't make it stick to the Clintons, but a lot of people's lives were ruined.\n\n&gt;Even in those moments of that seemingly intractable situation, Hillary rises above with grace and dignity. My argument on this point is that we know EVEYTHING about Hillary already; she has been in the public eye since 1972. I will give you that Hillary\u2019s goal this time would be to define herself quickly and strongly, but that\u2019s what every presidential election is about.   [...]  The only people who are not aware of these issues or haven\u2019t had them hammered into her brain for years would be people in the 20s currently.\n\nYou're arguing from a position that I, or others, don't like Hillary.  This is false, I do like and respect her, though I think some of her positions are grandstanding and she's been silent on others of importance or only spoken out once the tide of popularity was clear.  \n\nYou also seem to want both sides of this part of the argument.  We know everything about Hillary/She needs to define herself/the past doesn't matter/it's never been successfully used against her.  I'd shade toward the former, and while she'll have a hand in framing the dialogue, her status as a known quantity didn't help her run against Obama.  She was seen as a cold, angry, business-as-usual Washington insider.  Could she shake that reputation if she ran again?  Only time will tell.\n\n&gt;And this isn\u2019t a Hillary problem, this is a running for president problem, everyone has it.\n\nVery true, but like I said above, I tried to answer OP's question fairly.  Your arguments seem to stem from the idea that she is a very electable candidate and that her scandals are long in the past.  I would agree, to an extent, but there's no easy road to the White House.  You seem to suggest she rises above her negatives, but this has hardly been the case.  Her name, alone, carries baggage.  I like her.  I like her as a person and as a candidate, but you can't ignore that Republicans hate her, that she espouses every position they would fight tooth and nail to defeat, that she would absolutely radicalize the right.  She's a pro-choice, pro gun-control, pro-healthcare, pro-gay rights liberal who will appoint liberal judges and political appointees, and *she's not even a particularly liberal person/politician!*  She's close to a moderate on most issues but she's still blindingly left to anyone on the right.\n\n&gt;But are people going to want to go back in the dumpster and pick out the trash that we were seeing 24 hours a day and reached some sort of consensus on in the 90s?\n\nI think it's foolish to think that they wouldn't when you consider how they attacked Kerry and McCain for Vietnam-era issues.  Before you think that there's a line too low for the Republicans to squeeze under to throw mud, remember that the Republicans and George Bush painted John McCain, a decorated war hero who was imprisoned in Vietnam while serving his country, as an angry, homicidal candidate intent on restarting the war in Vietnam to get revenge.  This really happened.  In our lifetime. \n\n&gt;All of the stories are old and used and the other Republicans have never even been fully vetted.  What if Christie likes to have sex with underage boys? We all know Rand Paul isn\u2019t a licensed ophthalmologist, but licensed himself, and Rubio is probably from outer space. \nWe know Hillary, she\u2019s a national name, she has been through the freak show and survived. We don\u2019t know anything about the other candidates AND they aren\u2019t national figures. Even Christie is going to have a very hard time making himself a national candidate.\n\nOPs question didn't have anything to do with the Republican candidates, and you're getting a bit silly at the end of too-long a debate.  I don't think Christie can survive the Republican primary season for the same reason Hillary will have a hard time, his kind of popularity can't stand up to the kind of scrutiny he'll receive as a national candidate.

It's been referred to as the Reagan Rule, the Eleventh Commandment and the Reagan Doctrine in media, and I took the time to highlight the applicable portion for context.  Debate, but don't be pedantic.\n\n&gt;Unwritten rule? There are many theories floating around that say candidates should use a primary to get all the worst press/ attacks out.\n\nThis has been the pattern lately, where candidates in primary campaigns have fought so hard against each other that they damage their chances on the main stage.  Obama and Hillary stayed clear of most of that, the most damaging things they lobbied at each other were the \"3am phone call\" campaign.  Meanwhile the Republicans were destroying each other until only McCain, who started out as a long-shot, was left.  And then they repeated this action in the last election where Republicans like Bachman and Perry tried to tear down Romney, and dragged the primary out for so long, that by the time the national campaign started he was already badly damaged and didn't have the support of the conservative right.  How many times did we hear 'I'll hold my nose and vote for Romney'?\n\n&gt;It seems as if you think it wouldn\u2019t be bad if Hillary were tied to the Clinton Era.\n\nI really couldn't say, it's a matter of spin.  I think everyone from the 90s takes way too much credit for the economic success, the same way current Republicans seem to deify Reagan.  It's a way to take credit for the good things and gloss over the bad.\n\n&gt;Of course I\u2019ve been reductive, but as it stands the Clintons came out clear and clean. Bring on whitewater.\n\nClear of charges, not necessarily clear and clean in reputation, but then how can you account for her significant unfavorable ratings 7 years ago?  How can you account for her losing to Obama?\n\n&gt;Perhaps it wasn\u2019t clear that I was referring to New York State polls? It seems as if you responded as if they were national polls, as you used a national figure to respond to my state figure. The idea was to show that the people in NY didn\u2019t necessarily like her, she wasn\u2019t from NY, she was seen as riding off her husbands coat tails, but when people saw her in action they liked her very much.\n\nThanks for clarifying your numbers.  Again, though, I don't think it's that hard to build a good reputation as a liberal in New York, and while any transplant candidate starts behind the 8 ball, she was elected - therefore succeeding in the only poll that matters - and worked hard.  I have no problem with her record in New York, but every candidate that runs for President is popular in their home state.  \n\n&gt;I\u2019m sure there are many feminists who would not take kindly to that remark. Why is it that men find it so difficult to talk about women\u2019s issues? Abortion?\n\nI strongly disagree.  If a feminist position or advocacy were considered controversial *that* would the insult to feminists, as if implying that a women's right or a family benefit was somehow an extraordinary outlier.  Women's rights are widely acknowledged, and any attack on women's rights is huge news.  Consider either Texas or the congressional recent panel of white, male, republicans who debated women's contraception, without a woman in the room.  These were huge stories that hurt the Republicans on the national stage.  Taking a position *against* women's reproductive health, women's right to choose, pay inequality, children's health, benefits and subsidies for families, etc, would **rightly** be controversial and draw ridicule and possibly alienate a large and powerful demographic.  It's much like gay marriage among democrats.  The safe position is now to support gay rights, and the unpopular opinion is to delay or deny those rights.  Feminists should rightly celebrate that women's rights are now the mainstream, and that advocating on their behalf is the safe, popular position, and attacking or withholding women's rights is the unpopular position.  Feminists win when their causes are seen as safe, unassailable and inviolate and when anyone seeks to deny them is seen as a bigot.\n\n[Consider recent Huffington/Fox News poll](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/polls/fox-17613)\n\nClinton 56/38, good numbers but less than 5 percent undecided.\n\nChris Christie 46/20, (and I think we agree, a very small chance of succeeding in the Republican party) but 21% never heard of and 13% undecided.  That's a lot of minds available to be changed and if they break roughly in half he's looking at 60/40, or similar to Hillary's numbers.\n\nHow many minds are available for her to change when she has such a low undecided return?  \n\nTo be clear, for I think the third time, I like her, I think she could win against a number of the potential Republican opponents and be a good President, even in her 70s, but I responded to OP's question fairly, and detailed what I think are her weaknesses.  I think if you were honest you'd have to acknowledge some of them too.  Somewhere, in a safe or a burn bag, there's an opposition prep report that the Clinton campaign had made in 2006 detailing all of her weakness, every old skeleton that the media or the Republicans would find and drag out on the national stage, and I'm sure that folder was much, much larger than my little post here.\n\nYour argument seems to be that her cons are either not applicable or are old news and therefore have no significance in an upcoming national election.  You've argued my points, but how do you respond to OP's original question.  What do you think are the cons (we know what your pro opinions are) of a Hillary campaign or Presidency?  How do you account for her loss to Obama?  How do you account for her still-high unfavorable ratings, years before she'd have to start building a campaign?  How do you account for her massive drops in popularity every time news comes out about Benghazi?

There are many theories floating around that say candidates should use a primary to get all the worst press/ attacks out. The idea is that if one faces allegations soon and head on it will be less detrimental in a general election. One always wants to keep bad press as far away from election day as possible. Kerry\u2019s problem, for example, was that the swift boat adds happened too close to the election and that he botched the response. Get it out there and over with fast, and never lie. \n\n\n-Obama won on hope and change, partly because he wasn't a known quantity. There are few people left that don't have an opinion on Hillary\n\nHillary can\u2019t run on hope and change, partly because the Democratic Party would not want her to. One of the things that the Democratic Party points out in the DFA and OFA trainings is that they have essentially used two campaign slogans going back to 1976, when the Dem Party had completely changed their primary process under the McGovern/ Fraser Commission. The readers digest version is that if a Democratic candidate comes after another Democratic president or a time of eceonomc prosperity then that candidate will run on continuation, and if the candidate was running against a CREEP (Campaign to Reelect the President,) then that candidate will run on change. I\u2019m trying to say that this is a very different time 2016, with our with Hillary, will not be run the same way. \n\n\n-We did have a balanced budget\u2026 Anyone who was president at the time was going to reap the benefit of the market growing so dramatically, and with the Gulf War ending before Clinton took office, the country was suddenly rich and getting richer.\n\nIt seems as if you think it wouldn\u2019t be bad if Hillary were tied to the Clinton Era.\n\n\n-That's a bit reductive.

Bring on whitewater. \n\n\n\n-You also seem to want both sides of this part of the argument. We know everything about Hillary/She needs to define herself/the past doesn't matter/it's never been successfully used against her.\n\nI\u2019m not wanting to have both sides of the argument, by saying that you seem to imply that there is already a general consensus concerning Hillary and her scandals. To be clear, I was saying that a consensus has already been reached on these subjects many years ago and she came out looking pretty clean. There could be a chance that people will try to bring up all the old bad blood, but she has the ability to define herself another way and win the argument. For example, she could take her new foundation, No Ceilings, and create a much larger name for herself as a women\u2019s rights leader. Then try talking to the stately women\u2019s rights leader about her husbands infidelity, the talking points write themselves. My larger point was that American presidential elections are about defining yourself and the other candidate. \n\n\n\n-I haven't seen any numbers for her that jumped that high in or around 2006, do you have a source? Most polls at that time had her favorable/unfavorable around 52-54/39-43\n\nPerhaps it wasn\u2019t clear that I was referring to New York State polls?

As I said, she has to have a good argument, she needs to start defining herself. \n\n\n\n-Frankly, they are safe issues. When has a politician fallen out of favor advocating on behalf of women, children, education and health?\n\nI\u2019m sure there are many feminists who would not take kindly to that remark. Why is it that men find it so difficult to talk about women\u2019s issues? Abortion?\n\n\n-Cheap? Absolutely. Will it alienate women voters? Potentially.\n\nThe Lewinski talk strengthens women\u2019s support for Hillary, just look at her national numbers after 1998, she got a huge boost. Many say that they agreed with her decision, or found that it was her own private decision not to be appraised, but as Maya Angelou said, \u201cI watched her show what it was like to be a woman in distress and difficulty. I watched her as she was on the front pages of every journal in the world. And I watched her stand.\u201d Most women agree with Dr. Angelou and would find an ad about Bill Clinton\u2019s infidelity to be repulsive and old news. Which, I just must add, if having a good marriage is a prerequisite for running for high office, there would have been many issues in the past/ present.  \n\n", "edited": 1384711698, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1qsqg8", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdggl71", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384711223", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdgd7a4", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428623601, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdgehkr", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384705554", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdg7s6d", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428624201, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Democratic field was trying to follow the Reagan Doctrine?

Hillary was all over journals around the world. It must be mentioned that Ken Star and the Republicans set up a $76 million apparatus completely dedicating to destroying Bill and Hillary, but we still had a balanced budget, peace, and over threw a dictator in Haiti. Whitewater was earlier mentioned. So, Ken had decided he wanted to nail Hillary on whitewater, because after all the freak show he had turned nothing else up. Hillary could have testified in the white house concerning whitewater, as did Bill testify in the white house concerning Lewinski, BUT they had to drag Hillary into a federal court building. I still remember the first question Ken asked her, \u201cMrs. Clinton, is there any other place you would rather be today?\u201d A huge smile came over Hillary\u2019s face and she said, \u201cOh! I can think of about a million other places.\u201d It turned up that nothing was found concerning whitewater, just that Jim Mcdougal was a shady character. Even in those moments of that seemingly intractable situation, Hillary rises above with grace and dignity.  My argument on this point is that we know EVEYTHING about Hillary already; she has been in the public eye since 1972. I will give you that Hillary\u2019s goal this time would be to define herself quickly and strongly, but that\u2019s what every presidential election is about. And this isn\u2019t a Hillary problem, this is a running for president problem, everyone has it. But are people going to want to go back in the dumpster and pick out the trash that we were seeing 24 hours a day and reached some sort of consensus on in the 90s? The only people who are not aware of these issues or haven\u2019t had them hammered into her brain for years would be people in the 20s currently. All of the stories are old and used and the other Republicans have never even been fully vetted. What if Christie likes to have sex with underage boys? We all know Rand Paul isn\u2019t a licensed ophthalmologist, but licensed himself, and Rubio is probably from outer space. We know Hillary, she\u2019s a national name, she has been through the freak show and survived. We don\u2019t know anything about the other candidates AND they aren\u2019t national figures.

And that\u2019s coming out of NY! \n\nI haven't seen any numbers for her that jumped that high in or around 2006, do you have a source?  Most polls at that time had her favorable/unfavorable around 52-54/39-43.  That unfavorable number is key, it's considered dangerous to try to run a national campaign if your unfavorable rating is higher than 40 unless your favorable number is much higher, and they hidden number is how many are undecided.  As you refer below, Hillary is very much a known quantity, very few people don't have a strong opinion of her.  Also, she got those numbers being a Senator in a very blue state, working with the most senior and possibly most powerful democrat in the Senate, during a time when the sitting President was becoming more and more unpopular.\n\nI agree that her numbers have gotten steadily higher since then, with the exception of losing the DNC primary which, considering she's only run one national campaign is really the only poll you need.  She wasn't a hypothetical candidate.  She ran and the Democrats chose someone else.  She's 0-1 on the national stage, and it wasn't for lack of trying.  Early in that primary season she was the presumptive nominee.\n\n&gt;Hillary\u2019s numbers are and have been stellar since 2006. So, I don\u2019t think any thinking person can deny her insane popularity or make the argument that she is polarizing because she was not popular in the 90s. Give me a break.\n\nHer numbers have been excellent since 2006, but that's partly because the legacy of former presidents improves as we get farther from it (Consider both the popularity of Reagan and Clinton now compared to the ends or low points of their Presidencies).  Also, there tends to be a strong statistical bump for former Secretaries of State.  Rice and Powell both enjoyed unprecedented popularity during and after their term at State.  Does that popularity continue into a national campaign?  Hard to say, I don't have a precedent at hand.  Part of that popularity stems from the fact that the State department takes no position on domestic issues, so you get the popularity of an important national position without being dragged down into the mud of daily politics.\n\n&gt;I do not understand how Hillary could be seen as an extension of the 90s Clinton era. \n\nI don't understand how you couldn't.\n\n&gt;Rosalynn Carter sat in on meetings with the chiefs of staff, Eleanor Roosevelt is obviously famous for her political involvement, Nancy Reagan was also involved in public debate and selection of her husband\u2019s advisors.  \n\nNone of those people, none, have ever run for national office after their husband left the White House.  I don't know how you could try to draw that comparison.  Every first lady since Jackie has had a national profile and cause celebre, but few were seen as the political force that got their husband elected and helped run his White House.  There's a reason that former Presidents are seldom seen weighing in on national issues.  They all retain a respectful privacy, not engaging in debate or undermining the current President.  In this case the former President would either be front and center on all issues or conspicuously absent, and Bill Clinton doesn't like being left out of the debate and he *really* doesn't like people attacking his wife.\n\n&gt;The partner of the president is a very strange, unelected position, which leaves the power of the position completely up to the individual. There will always be questions about the president\u2019s partner in a highly political environment.\n\nI agree, she would have to face those questions.\n\n&gt;Hillary was not in the military, but I\u2019m very curious as to why that would matter. Many presidents have not had \u201cmilitary experience.\u201d Hillary did, though, sit on the Armed Services committee when she was in the senate. That is not to mention the type of experience she would have gained being secretary of state.\n\nI agree, and I addressed this in another post below, and the American people are often willing to accept positions like State and key committee positions as executive experience relating to the military.  But unless she runs against someone with no war record or military experience the questions would absolutely come up, as they've come up in nearly every presidential election in recent memory.  The likelihood of her running against someone without a strong military history increases all the time, since Vietnam was too long ago and Iraq too recent, but it is almost always a campaign issue. \n\n&gt;Don\u2019t let the 90s distract you, Hillary\u2019s central issues all of her life have been women and girls. Do you not remember the \u201cit takes a village\u201d speech from the 1996 DNC? Not to mention the work with the children\u2019s defense fund, etc.\n\nI agree, I don't think I ever questioned her commitment to women's groups and family.  I read It Takes a Village and very much enjoyed it.\n\n&gt;People are tired of the same old political gags. \n\nThis is absolutely not true, and I'd ask you to support that proposition.  People say they are tired of those gags, but when you see the kind of bullshit that makes it's way into national politics you realize people eat that shit up.  Obama and drugs, the birther movement, the Tea Party holding government hostage, Anthony Weiner and Elliot Spitzer.  The American people say they have little tolerance for these things and then viewership and readership go through the roof.  \n\n&gt;The only reasons we ever talked about Vince Foster or whitewater was because republicans could not defeat Bill politically, so they tried to defeat him personally and Ken Star was running dry on Lewinski.\n\nThat's a bit of shuffling of the chronology.  The Whitewater controversy was an issue in 1992 and came to prominence in Bill Clinton's first campaign and term (in an era before the kind of internet we have now, and before the 24-hr news cycle), Filegate was in 1996, and the Lewinsky scandal was 1998.  I agree Ken Starr tried to dig up skeletons in an ill-advised attempt to extend his prosecution of the Clintons, but those scandals predated Lewinsky.\n\n&gt;Hillary hasn\u2019t stood up for difficult issues? I hope that it doesn\u2019t imply that women, children, education, and healthcare are safe issues. It\u2019s sort of like when old southern men call those issues, \u201cfemale/ soft issues.\u201d\n\nFrankly, they are safe issues.  When has a politician fallen out of favor advocating on behalf of women, children, education and health?  Those issues are universal, they are unimpeachable except when arguing about funding and privacy, and anyone who attacks you on those issues risks alienating key demographics.  Advocating for families is probably the most 'safe' position you can take.  \n\n&gt;I\u2019m sorry, but in 2013 it is very cheap to use Lewinski. [...] I think bringing up Bill\u2019s infidelity and her choice not to divorce him might upset a lot of women voters, just saying.\n\nCheap?  Absolutely.  Will it alienate women voters?  Potentially.  Though if Hillary's numbers stayed as strong with women as they are now there might not be an undecided women left.  If she took 75% of women the way Obama overwhelmingly carried blacks, and the remaining 25% of women were firm Republican that already thought of her unfavorably, painting her with scandal might not move the needle among women and might draw out more Republican men and family values minorities like Latinos.  Hard to say, the RNC would run a thousand polls before getting dirty in those areas, but the Heritage Foundation or the Koch brothers?  With their own money and their own axe to grind and who absolutely hate Bill Clinton and would love to see him torn down?  I think it's naive to think it wouldn't come up considering the players involved.\n", "id": "t1_cdgdyuk", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "lovesthebj", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cdg75y5", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428623844, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1qsqg8", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdgdyuk", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384703826", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdg374x", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428627202, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I must address the cons here.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Lots of answers about the individual mandate and potential costs, all of which are the most relevent answers.\n\nOne issue that used to be a popular talking point in the 90's when Hillary Clinton was campaigning as first lady for healthcare overhaul, and was repeatedly referenced by President Obama in his first campaign, was that this was an issue that was more profitable for politician when it hadn't been decided.  A lot of the initial resistance by Republicans stemmed from the fact that they believed no satisfactory agreement could be made.  Much like the future of Social Security, it was much more promising as a campaign issue than an actual law.  \n\nIt's not just Republicans who are guilty of this.  There has long been a desire to see the government address the issue of healthcare, and it's been debated for decades, but in the face of both Democratic and Republican majorities no one ever managed to create law, until Obama.  \n\nThere are a number of issues that politicians count on to be able to use as talking points.  Healthcare, Social Security, Medicare, Campaign Finance Reform, Federal Regulation, Abortion, etc, etc.  There is simply very little will to finally resolve these issues, they are more profitable as wedge issues.  They want to be able to make promises about it when they fund raise at home.\n\nIf it sounds cynical, it absolutely is.  There was a quote from that same period when Clinton was lobbying Congress to pass healthcare reform.  I can't remember who said it, but they were quoted to the effect of, \"No one wants this law.  We need this to be an issue in two years.\"  It's also telling that the current ACA is essentially the Republican plan from years ago, the one that continued to support insurance companies and allow the market to dictate prices.  But when presented with their own plan they still recoiled.  They never wanted a solution, any plan was going to be expensive and unwieldy, they wanted the issue.\n\nThe Tea Party have always had a more libertarian bent, they don't like government expenditure, they don't like government overreaching, and while their tactics are abhorrent and their seeming ignorance of national issues is unconscionable, there are points to be made about spending.  There has to be an opposition party whose mandate is fiscal conservatism, since the Democrats and Republicans both seem to like large governments with long reaches.  \n\nPersonally, I think that while the new ACA may be big and expensive, and it may not achieve a fraction of what it intends, and will probably look dramatically different 25 years from now, I think the most important step is that such a law was passed.  Citizens now have health care protections, can't be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions, and within a year, hopefully, most people won't have to choose between food and medicine, and won't go broke dying slowly.  The law can change and grow, it can be trimmed and reshaped, but it's very unlikely any politician will ever have the will and the support to snatch back healthcare from people who need it.

This number can be difficult to track in cases where diminished service doesn't necessarily lead to a change in consumer patterns in the short term.  \n\nAllegorically, is there a place you go to frequently, like a McDonald's, a grocery store, a gas station, where you would divert your business if the service suffered?  Or would you forget as soon as your transaction was done.  Conversely, people might be more responsive to high turnover in for something like a gym, your doctor, your insurance carrier or your investment broker.  Poor service can lead to a dramatic change in customer preferences.\n\nThe cost of turning over employees is very real, Costco reaps the benefit of keeping happy employees by later promoting them to management positions and ensuring healthy operation, but much like providing extra vacation days or more benefits, it can seem counter-intuitive for a short-sighted employer to pay more for less.

As /u/PoliSciUgGuy already laid out, your taxes are paying for it either way.  Either as subsidies to employers who pay for health coverage for their employees, or in the form of Medicare and Medicade which cover those who qualify for those plans.  Taxes are paying for those things whether the government becomes the payer or distributes tax revenue back to employers in an employer-pay model.  There are times when we are each a participant in the free market and others when we are one nation, with national interests.  I would argue that healthcare, as much as any other issue, is a national interest and requires collective action.  One standard for all, just like each American receives the same military defense, the same legal status, the same civil protections, the same access to infrastructure.  I appreciate, though, that many don't agree.  It does create a nanny state, and there is little incentive to respect the cost of healthcare when it is guaranteed to you.

As /u/PoliSciUgGuy already laid out, your taxes are paying for it either way.  Either as subsidies to employers who pay for health coverage for their employees, or in the form of Medicare and Medicade which cover those who qualify for those plans.  Taxes are paying for those things whether the government becomes the payer or distributes tax revenue back to employers in an employer-pay model.  There are times when we are each a participant in the free market and others when we are one nation, with national interests.  I would argue that healthcare, as much as any other issue, is a national interest and requires collective action.  One standard for all, just like each American receives the same military defense, the same legal status, the same civil protections, the same access to infrastructure.  I appreciate, though, that many don't agree.  It does create a nanny state, and there is little incentive to respect the cost of healthcare when it is guaranteed to you.  Why should anyone feel obligated to eat well and exercise when heart bypass surgery and comprehensive rehab is covered by the state?

Give implies they had some sort of choice and benevolently chose to contribute.  This misconception stems from the fact that a person likely receives a paycheck of some sort and has their taxes aportioned out based on their income.  That money that is collected in tax was never theirs.  It is not a gift or a tithe, a person's pay is the portion remaining after taxes.  This is the price we pay for national defense and critical infrastructure, roads, schools, police officers, etc.  Every salary, as well as the cost of every good and service, necessarily includes the understanding that the gross represents both the personal take and the government's portion, and changing the tax rate is merely the renegotiation of that division.  If the tax system were changed so that no American ever paid taxes, the employer would simply pay the government and salary would be reduced proportionately.

Obama was attacked in his first election for close ties to Rev. Jeremiah Wright, which didn't gain much traction but became a theme that had to be constantly addressed.  \n\nObama also seemed to keep, or was accused of keeping, the church at arms length for periods of his campaign and presidency, seeming to only refer to prayer or going to church when it was politically necessary.  The Obama campaign wasn't necessarily vulnerable in that area, but they wouldn't have been interested in a debate about faith.  \n\nOther factors that may have contributed were that the public brush the democrats were painting Romney with was the rich, elite, out-of-touch 1-percenter that had nothing in common with most of the country.  They were ultimately successful with this approach, and it seemed during the campaign they had a steady diet of ammunition.  They may have decided that attacking Romney in a new way, nationally, would have little return.  In fact it could have backfired, since Romney was, in the minds of most voters, a moral person and family man.  \n\nAlso, it's likely that the places where a religious attack might have mattered would be the south, where best the opposition might have hoped for is the Romney vote just staying home.  I don't know for sure, but I would guess there was a lot of targeted advertising in those states, probably by PACs, that laid the religious angle on thick.  This is becoming the more popular approach.  If you want to hit someone below the belt and preserve deniability you get a SuperPac to create an ad separate from the campaign, and with today's extraordinary tracking you can pinpoint exactly which votes you want to get the message.\n\nAnother point is that for the national campaign, you need the news media to be complicit in your campaign.  They can't stop you from bringing up religion in a debate or pivoting a question to Romney's faith, but if they're not interested in the answers it's just going to get buried or snap back on you.  Crafting a message to voters necessarily includes talking about the things the networks want to discuss, and that give months of material.  They want to talk about social programs, they want to talk about the economy, they want to talk about healthcare and foreign aid and military spending because they can bring in pundits and argue about it forever.  In this news environment, it would probably have been seen as a kind of racism if the networks started openly discussing Romney's faith and associating that with his ability to govern.\n\nIn the 60s it was far more extraordinary for a politician to be strictly Catholic, most Presidents until that time were Presyterian/Protestant.  Protestants effectively came to be by throwing off the authority of the Catholic Church and the Pope, who at the time was a very influential political leader.  The suspicion was that a Catholic president would necessarily submit the will of the government to the authority of the Pope.  \n\nBut, they attacked Kennedy on a number of grounds.  Being rich and privileged, having a famous political father who had a lot of enemies, being young and relatively inexperienced, being east-coast and out-of-touch, and plain not being nearly as smart as Nixon, and being different from the mid-west/southern values of most Americans (although the South didn't particularly like Nixon either, both candidates were pro civil rights).", "id": "t1_cbr14jh", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "lovesthebj", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1koejs", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1429773598, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cbr14jh", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1376940872", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}

She surprisingly doesn't carry women in the numbers you'd expect, she actually just barely won the women's vote in a hypothetical head-to-head with Palin early in primary season.  In 2008 Hillary's favorable/unfavorable numbers were consistently 48/44, and that's a huge unfavorable number.  Usually if that number is approaching or over 40 you wouldn't consider a run.  It also leaves a scant 8% undecided, meaning most people have already made up their mind with her.\n\nShe hits all the right demos, but people don't get out and march for her.  Bill Clinton, who was Obama's surprisingly powerful ally in the last election, is both a blessing and a curse for Hillary.  She has to campaign against the idea that the country would just be re-electing her husband to be the power behind the office, if he campaigns for her it'll look like he's the superior candidate because he's an incredibly powerful speaker, she'll have to address his record in office and their marital problems, and all that will get dragged back out again.\n\nI have no doubt she could do it, and that she'd be an excellent executive, but election would get ugly.  Unfortunately the trend seems to be towards an Obama-like celebrity candidate, someone with whom the nation has limited familiarity so they can craft their own narrative and give the opposition very little to attack.  \n\nThe last few elections have shown that Democrats tend to attack Republican ideology, because that's what Democratic voters respond to, and Republicans tend to attack the candidate, deconstructing them so the nation rejects them.  \n\nElizabeth Warren has a pretty small national profile, is making a lot of noise lately, sits on a powerful subcommittee, and was the third last speaker at the DNC convention, behind Villaragosa (Chairman of the DNC) and Bill Clinton.  My guess is she's being positioned for a run.\n\nOn the GOP side, it'll never, ever, ever be Christie.  He can't possibly win the Republican primary.  He'd be shredded in the south, none of the major donors would come out for him, none of the key money raisers, SuperPacs, ground game coordinators and key billionaires will ever support him.  He's too soft (heh) on major conservative issues, and too friendly with democrats.  A moderate republican might be more electable in the national election, but any candidate will have to prove their conservative bona fides before ever getting that far, and Christie plays it too close to the middle.  Conservative darlings like Rick Perry will take all the money and press, and Christie will be playing defense for a year trying to get noticed in red states.  You look at how Perry is railing against Obamacare, railing against spending, railing against abortion, railing against contraception, positioning himself with the church on all issues, that's what you have to do to be the Republican nominee.

Another term or two in the Senate is going to let Republicans force her to vote on controversial bills and take strong positions that she'll have to defend in the general.

A parliamentary system could be a close representation of the will of the people, but in many parliamentary countries elected officials vote as a block, with strict rules allowing the party leader to enforce discipline among the ranks.  In Canada, failing to vote with your party effectively leads to exile, where a member of parliament can be punished so severely as to basically have their job stripped from them.  The means the Prime Minister is also the leader of their party, and forces their party to vote as a block, and if in the majority can act almost unilaterally.  This can, and has, led to strong regional popularity allowing one party to legislate the entire country without any practical opposition and few checks against their power.  \n\nIf members in a parliamentary system were allowed to vote freely it would be more democratic than most parliamentary systems practice now.", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "lovesthebj", "id": "t1_c9dq526", "parent_id": "t1_c9dk73h", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431583116, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1c6fpw", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9dq526", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1365772525", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1b2unt", "selftext": "The reluctance of the Supreme Court justices has as much to do with their well-chronicled and openly-stated desire to not use the bench to force large-scale changes to the law before the legislature has acted, or more strikingly, in defiance of the legislature.  Even stridently liberal judges often seek to give narrow rulings, order retrials, or dismiss cases based on standing.  The court is much more comfortable ruling on the specific limits of existing law, bringing clarity to the grey areas between law and practice.  In that sense, it's less about how persuasive the oral arguments are, and more about whether the petitioning parties are persuasive enough to compel the court to act in a grand, sweeping manor which is out of their character.  Further, a great deal of the argument is contained in the amicus briefs, editorials and supporting arguments submitted by a number of other expert parties.  This is why you see editorial articles in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal from all the interested parties.  The Judges read these and include them in their deliberations.  If a judge doesn't want to make new law, if they would rather return the issue to the state or federal government, they will entertain arguments that let them off the hook or at least rule as narrowly as possible.  Brown v. Board of Education and Roe v. Wade were landmark decisions because the Supreme Court took a strong hand in a very complex and controversial subject.\n\nAll that to say, don't get too swept up in the oral arguments.  Judges take a lot more into account than a day of dialogue, and while the temper of the room and the line of questioning often give insight into the justice's predisposition it can be misleading. For example, Chief Justice Roberts sounded very skeptical during the questioning for the Obamacare case, and then ruled in favor.
