Madison.\n\nIs a gross simplification of what happened, to the point of being inaccurate and accurate at the same time. The Marbury v. Madison case is a topic in and of itself, but what is relevant to this discussion is the Supreme Court has judicial review powers with over 200 years of legal prescient. No matter what you opinion on the matter, the legal fact is they do have the authority.\n\n&gt; What is the point of Section 5?\n\nThe point of section 5 of the 14th Amendment is to give congress the authority to make and change the laws that pertain to the Amendment. Section 4 of the 14th amendment (referring to the validity of Public debt) will require regular new laws from congress to address an ever changing economic environment. If the 14th amendment spelled out exactly how the Public debt had to be paid, it would have to be changed over and over again (though new constitutional amendments) as economic factors changed. Section 5 gave the congress the ability to make the specifics of how this is done to simplify to process and make ease of updating. \n\nAlso remember that section 5 of the 14th Amendment *only* applies to the 14th Amendment. It does not extend to any other laws.\n\n&gt; May Congress pass a law reversing a SCOTUS decision (as authorized in Section 5)?\n\nThis is actually a complex issue. The Supreme Court rules on the constitutionality of laws. Congress can pass laws that can then come up for judicial review. So depending on the reason why the Supreme Court ruled the way they did, in some situations Congress could change the affects of a Supreme Court ruling after the fact. In other situations the new law would fall by the same constitutional challenge of the previous law. \n\n&gt; May Congress determine that an abortion denies the fetus a right to life\" and so reverse Roe v. Wade?\n\nCould congress pass this law? Yes. It would then go to the Supreme Court and they would rule on the issue. It would almost certainly strike the down as unconstitutional citing the ruling in Roe v Wade. \n\nSo in conclusion, Congress can pass any law they want, and the Supreme Court can rule on cases however they want.

The President would remain in office for the duration of his term and have the ability to run for reelection after 4 years. If the President was directly related to the fraud, he would still be in office, but would most certainly be impeached.\n\nThe reason for this is how a President is actually elected, through a vote of the Electoral College. Each state actual makes their own rules for how Electors are selected and how they vote, but with small variation every state does the same thing. Here is how it breaks down.\n\nStep 1: The citizens of each State vote for who they want as President.\n\nStep 2: The candidate with the most votes gets all electoral votes from that state (Two states give out their electoral votes by the winner of each district as opposed to a state wide winner take all).\n\nStep 3: The State picks electors (citizens that do not hold any public office) based on the State's own protocols to vote in the electoral college. Almost every State requires these electors to make a pledge of who they will vote for prior to being selected as an Elector.\n\nStep 4: The Electors vote for who will be President. \n\nStep 5: The Elector's votes are counted in front of the House and the Senate. Members of the House and Senate have the opportunity to object to any of the votes at that time.\n\nStep 6: If there are no objections, or after the objections are resolved, the winner is declared and is sworn in as President.\n\nUltimately, the elector's vote and Congress' approval of the vote is the only thing that legally matters. Sometimes electors even vote differently than what the state's citizens voted and they pledge to vote (see faithless elector) but that vote is still the official vote.\n\nBy the time the President is sworn in, there is nothing that can reverse it.

This is a specific carve out of one type of organization that cannot be involved in politics.\n\nSo what are the other rights in the first amendment related to a person?  Freedom of Speech and Freedom of Assembly.  If people willingly choose to assemble and form an organization - a non-profit, a corporation, an LLC, a church - it makes sense that they would also keep their freedom of speech.  Or, to reverse it, can someone lose one right by exercising another?\n\nNow since the first amendment specifically states that churchs cannot participate, it strikes that off the list.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Probably yes, although I have not looked hard into the specifics of these laws outside of Texas. \n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in Planned Parenthood v Casey that the core of the Roe v Wade decision (that a woman is allowed to have an abortion because of the Constitutional Right to Privacy under the Due Process Clause) still held. However, during this decision they changed what restrictions could be placed by a State on abortion. \n\nThe first change was a State could restrict abortions after the fetus was viable (\"potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid\") and it was essentially left up to each state as to when viability was determined. Before this ruling, the court ruled that the earliest viability was 24 weeks therefore any law banning abortion prior to that time was unconstitutional. The second change was that state abortion law no longer had to pass [strict scrutiny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_scrutiny) and now only had to pass [undue burden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undue_burden), a far less strict requirement.\n\nLet's look at what Texas just passed, but first we have to understand one thing. The right of a woman to have an abortion is a personal freedom. There is no requirement that the federal or state government must provide access to this freedom, they just have limitations on what ways they can hinder it.\n\nThe Taxes law made viability at 20 weeks and no abortions are allowed after that point except for health of the mother. With the Planned Parenthood v Casey decision this is most certainly within the law as the state can ultimately decided viability. Additionally, the law made it so that doctor's offices which preformed abortions must have a fully equipped surgical center. This is why you heard that the new law would reduce the number of places in Texas you could have an abortion to 5. Most places that do abortions are not fully equipped surgical centers and these places are saying that the costs to properly upgrade are not financially possible. Thus the law reduces the number of places you could have an abortion in Texas from 40+ to 5.\n\nThe reason why there is no Constitutional conflict is because the State does not have to ensure a woman has access to abortions. If Texas passed a law that said \"abortions can only be preformed in Huston\" or \"There can only be 5 abortion clinics in the State\" those laws would clearly be struck down because that would be restricting access. This law says that any place that does abortions must meet criteria XYZ and the State has full right to regulate medical services. As long as the clinic meets XYZ they can preform abortions thus there is no legal issue.

Because the moment that fetus is alive, it gains its rights and you do not have the authority to deprive an individual of those rights. It goes back to the axiom, my right to swing my arm ends at your nose. \n\nIn no state is the depriving someone of their life a legal act unless it is an act self-defense. Thus, if you consider a few hundred human cells to be a life, you therefore consider that fetus to be an individual who has rights. At that point, the law protects that individuals right against being killed. Much like it protects your right to not be killed. \n\nIf viability outside the womb is considered to be the moment where life begins, then before that point (roughly 24 weeks) the fetus is not alive and therefore has no rights. If you wish to have an abortion before then it is your right. \n\nI really don't want to get into the whole 'consent to pregnancy' thing because it really doesn't matter in this discussion. The crux of it is this, the moment you consider a fetus to be alive, it has rights. Those rights include the right to live. The law cannot compel you to sacrifice in order to save a life, it can (and does) prohibit the taking of a life in all circumstances save for self-defense. For example: If you have a friend who is sleeping on your couch and being a general mooch, the law prohibits you from shooting them in the head to get them to leave. You can ask them to leave, however, if their only means of egress is to jump from the roof of a 100 story building, by using force to get them to leave you are depriving them of their right to life.

Some libertarians argue the same point when it comes to abortion. Your right to an abortion ends once the fetus is considered alive (generally, when it can live outside the womb). Once the fetus reaches this point, it is now a protected individual with rights of its own. This is the position that /u/dicktremain states and it is consistent with Roe v. Wade.\n\nNow specifically for your analogy, you are trying to equate preventing an abortion with being forced to save a third parties life. \n\nLets say you were in an automobile accident and needed to be hooked up to one person for the next nine months in order to survive. Would it be appropriate for the government to compel me, a third party who had no connection to the accident, to give up my liberty for several months to save your life? A libertarian would likely argue that it is not appropriate and that it is not the duty of government to restrict my rights to support your rights. (this is in many ways the same argument libertarians make against redistributive tax policy)\n\nHowever, if I were the cause of your accident, it would be completely within reason for the government to compel me (using force if necessary) to save your life. I would have caused this situation, so it is completely reasonable to compel me to mitigate as much potential harm as possible.  \n\nProximity to the cause of the accident must be considered. If I put you in that position then I should be responsible for the consequences of my actions. If I did not, then I have no obligation to you. \n\nNow, to extend this argument to abortion. If you did not willingly take part in the act of procreation (i.e. rape, immaculate conception, etc...) then the state has no right to restrict your ability to terminate the unwanted pregnancy. \n\nHowever, if you did willingly take part in the act of procreation, once the fetus becomes viable (able to survive outside the womb, even if it requires extensive medical care) your right to terminate the pregnancy no longer exists because you would be depriving someone else of their rights. \n\ntl;dr Your right to have an abortion ends when you deprive an individual their right to life.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; I don't know much about the details of Watergate scandal but I thought it was silly that Nixon got away with it.\n\nHe didn't get away with it. It was a complicated series of events but as everything was unraveling it became clear that Nixon had broken the law or at least been directly briefed on illegal activates of his personal staff. For this reason he was going to be impeached, but Nixon resigned before the impeachment could happen. That still left criminal charges against Nixon but the new President, Gerald Ford, gave Nixon a full pardon.\n\n&gt; Will Obama get away with the NSA spying program?\n\nYes, although I would not phrase it as \"get away\". Obama has not broken any law related to this whole NSA thing. The difference between the NSA and what happened with Nixon is that the NSA program has gone though proper channels. It was authorized by law and has been reviewed by a court (although a closed secret one) and they agree that it was legal. Now a lot of people bring up good points about the possible unconstitutionality of the law, and most certainly it will be challenged. However, until it is challenged the administration is working within the confines of the law to the best of their ability.\n\nEven if the NSA and laws empowering it are found to be unconstitutional, the Obama administration will still be unaffected (although the program will have to stop). Laws are found to be unconstitutional all the time but that does not mean that those who made the law, or use the law, committed a crime.

Currently in the US they are very much separated from a legal stand point.

Furthermore we are not like Germany, Japan, Greece, Ireland, Poland, and the UK (to name a few) that teach religions education in state run K-12 schools (or their equivalent). So from a legal stand point The US has some of the strictest separation of Church and State laws in the developed world.\n\nWhere the difference is, the US is also arguably the most religions county in the developed world based on metrics like the percentage of people who believe in a god, and peoples frequency of attending religions services. In a Representative Democracy we elect leaders to make decision based on their ideology. There is no way to make a law that says \"an elected official can make decisions based on their education, life experience, economic understanding, and their opinion; but they cannot make decisions based on their religion.\"\n\nSo as long as people vote politicians into office who are religions, you will have religions beliefs in politics.

If the plan does cost an employee more than 9.5% of their income, the business must pay the difference in cost.\n\n* If a business does not provide the minimum insurance, or if the plan costs an employee more than 9.5% of their year income, the business must pay a tax penalty per employee not properly covered.\n\nTo your specific questions,\n\n&gt; Is it company-based insurance? Like, Microsoft Insurance?\n\nNo. The company has to offer normal health insurance from a company like Blue Cross, United Health Care, ect. \n\n&gt; ...and I have to pay for it our of my own pocket, what cost is there to my employer? Do they have to pay part of my insurance or something?\n\nThey at a minimum have to pay the difference between the cost of the health insurance and 9.5% of the employee's yearly pay. The average yearly cost of a family health plan is [$15,980](http://kff.org/report-section/ehbs-2012-section-1/). So for every employee who makes $20,000 a year (roughly $10 per hour) the company would have to pay $14,080 per year of that employees health insurance. Note that $15,980 is the average family plan, and the minimums set forth by the ACA would be cheaper, but the company would still be paying a significant portion.\n\n&gt;  I just hear too much bitching at work about how much Obamacare is affecting everyone's hours\n\nCompanies can avoid providing insurance by making employees part time (less than 30 hours per week). Thus many companies  are cutting people to part time to avoid this increase in cost.\n\n&gt;  ...it sounds like it's just the employers cutting hours to maintain their profits high.\n\nYes and no. What the ACA has done is make more financial sense for a company to have 1600 employees working 30 hours a week, than 1200 employees working 40 hours a week. Would a company changing its employee base like this be solely for profitability? Yes. But that is what executives do, make their company adapt to changing environments. It use to be the extra administration cost of 25% more employees made it so that full time was more effective than part time.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I could interpret your question several ways (which is probably why you are having trouble finding an answer).\n\nInterpretation 1: You are talking about when a new bill is being passed. New legislation can be started be either house of Congress. That house then votes on it and sends it over to the other house. They can either vote on the bill as is or make amendments to the bill. If they vote on it as is, it goes to the President to sign. If they make amendments to the bill and vote for it, than it goes back to the first house to be voted on again.\n\nThe simple answer is both houses of Congress must get a majority vote on the same bill. If one house proposes changes, than the other house must vote on the bill after the changes. Note there are some powers (like the federal budget) that rest solely on one house of congress and do not need a vote from both houses.\n\nInterpretation 2: you are talking about changing an already existing law and asking how much congress is allowed to change it from its original intent. The answer to this is they can change the law however they see fit. This is done by the same process listed above (a vote in both houses on Congress) and Congress can change any law in anyway through this method.

Outside of a few scandals (like the Anthony Weiner situation where he claiming his twitter account was hacked) I cannot think of a politician actually lying. This may sound odd to you, but we have to look at what **is not** a lie.\n\n**Opinions.** Opinions are not lies. If a politician says he believes that deregulation will help the economy, than he believes that deregulation will help the economy. He is not lying, he might be horribly mistaken, but he is not lying. He is just stating his opinion. \n\n**Not providing all the information.** This is not lying. If a politician says that Obama's deficits have on average been 2.5X the size of Bush's deficits he is not lying. He is leaving out the other side of the argument which is Obama has been reduced the deficit each year, but not providing all the information is not lying.\n\n**Quoting other sources.** If a politician says that according to a study/economist/article that his tax plan will fix the economy, than he is not lying. Even if there are 20 other sources saying his tax plan will be disastrous, he is still just quoting a source and thus is not lying.\n\n**Briefing information.** If a politician is presented information by a campaign manager/intelligence agency/advisor and he presents that information, he is not lying. If a President says that a country has WMD's because an intelligence agency told him they do, he is not lying even if it turns out that country did not have WMD's.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ebm5l", "selftext": "There are many things very misleading about that video. It's core concept, that the top echelon of income has far more wealth than the rest, is correct. However, most everything else it presented is done so poorly.\n\nFirst we have to understand there is a difference between wealth and income. This video talks solely about wealth, which is the accumulated value of a persons assets (property, investments, cash, ect).  This skews the results dramatically in favor of those earning more money \n\nLet's look at a hypothetical example. Person 1 makes $35,000 per year, Person 2 makes $100,000 per year (after tax dollars), and both people have been working for 5 years.  Person 1 lives in an apartment, and spends $30,000 a year on rent, food, health insurance, and expenses. He saves $5,000 a year in a savings account to make a down payment on a house one day. At the end of 5 years he has $25,000 in the bank and that is his **wealth**.\n\nPerson 2 buys a house, and has a more lavish lifestyle spending $60,000 a year for mortgage, food, health insurance, and expenses. The remaining $40,000 a year he invents and gets a 5% return on investments. At the end of 5 years he has about $230,000 in investments and $50,000 of equity in his house (he has been paying down the mortgage). This gives him $280,000 in **wealth**.\n\nSo in this example even though person 2 makes 3X the income as person 1, after 5 years he ends up with 12X the wealth. As the years go on this gap will only continue to widen from the compound interest of person 2's investments. Additionally, you could also see how someone making only a little less than $35,000 per year would have substantially less wealth as there is a baseline cost of living. \n\nWealth is a bad way of measuring income inequality.

I would feel much more comfortable requiring more of new college-entrants if I felt they were better prepared to make those important college decisions. My personal experience, however, has left with me the overwhelming opinion that most college-entrants are not sufficiently prepared. If the end goal for every college student was to put themselves in the best possible position for future employment, then we would have decidedly too many students majoring in \"things they like\" or \"things they're good at\" than \"things that will put some bread on the table\". For kids that have wealth in their family to support them, they have the luxury of taking into account their personal enjoyment. But for other students, their most impactful career decision may very well be what they major in. Your major is a large determining factor in your first job, and your first job is often the largest determining factor for your entire career. That's a lot to wrap your head around as a newly graduated high school senior, and often these kids have spent close to no time thinking about it (not to mention all the shit about the world you simply don't have a clue about in high school). It's not that I have any sort of ethical problem asking 18 year olds to make such important decisions, and make them well. I just think it's currently impractical to expect those decisions to be sound, well-thought out, or advantageous for the students.

Maybe you meant college degrees on average don't bring you as much as they used to. Or maybe you meant that certain majors from particular universities don't reap many benefits. But surely you didn't mean that college degrees have negligible value in this country. Go get a STEM major from any state public school and you've got better job prospects than most of your high school peers. If you really think that all those jobs are being outsourced you probably haven't been trying to find a job with a STEM degree lately. Make it to an elite university? Maybe you have more wiggle room then and can major in something less practical. I think one of the overarching problems is that so many kids grow up being told simply \"Get to college\". And then they do, and they pick a major that lacks job prospects and leave college possessing few practical skills that they didn't already have after high school. The value of possessing a college degree certainly isn't as high as many of us grew up thinking. But some, perhaps a very significant portion, of the problem is that *students* are making their degrees less valuable by obtaining fewer practical, in-demand skills while in college. Shit, go learn programming. Want job security? Major in CS. There are still plenty of ways for a college education to vastly improve your socio-economic standing.

If a company does not want to hire blacks, that is not free speech. Funding political campaigns is not one either\n\nThis seems to be the core of your argument and unfortunately it is an impassable obstacle. The reason for this is the Citizen's United v FEC Supreme Court ruling. Instead of leaving it at that I am going to explain what this ruling was and why you cannot get around it.\n\nTo start with we look at organizations like PETA, NRA, and Greenpeace to name a few. These organizations take donations from individuals and corporations and use this money as they see fit to promote their causes. They can run advertisements, have people go door to door and had out pamphlets, collect signatures, what ever they wish to do with the money. The entire purpose of these organizations is to collect donations and use that money to spread a message. No one questions the legality of these organizations to promote their ideals. \n\nNow we get to what the Citizens United v FEC case was about. If under the 1st Amendment I have the right to advocate for my cause, with donations given to my organization, why does the law change when what I'm advocating is a political topic? Why am I allowed to collect unlimited donations to run commercials advocating animal protection, but I cannot do this to run commercials promoting the ACA? Why do I have less freedoms when talking about a political topic or person than a non-political topic or person?\n\nThis is what the case was about, and the Supreme Court ruled that there should not be a difference between these two kinds of speech. For this reason, just as you can donate however much money you want to PETA and it can use this money however it likes; you can also donate as much as you like to a PAC and it can use this money however it likes.

In what sense is \"politics\" itself a failed system? Are you confusing \"politics\" in general with one specific kind of political structure?

But generally speaking, political scientists study the ways by which societies as a whole make some of the most important decisions they will ever make (eg. whether to go to war, how to allocate scarce resources, what rules and norms to enforce, what services and public goods to provide, etc.) These are absolutely not just historical questions because societies are still making these decisions right now, and will continue to make these decisions throughout the foreseeable future.\n\nMost political scientists would probably believe that by understanding these decisions, how/why they are made, and what factors lead to what outcomes, we can equip people to make \"better\" decisions when it comes to these most fundamental and far-reaching decisions. \n\nSome do this by studying institutions (ie. how do formal arrangements like parties, NGOs, committees, or filibusters affect outcomes?). Some do this by studying behavior (ie. what factors influence the way people participate in, think about, and ultimately make the aforementioned decisions?). Some do this by studying political philosophy (ie. what do ideas like liberty, justice, citizenship, and democracy mean conceptually?).

You assume they have exemplary standards of evidence and reason. But who ensures the rationality of political scientists, making sure that they will be held accountable for the integrity of their advice and conclusions?\n\nLike any other science, some people have exemplary standards and others have less than exemplary standards. I don't doubt that there are some lousy scientists out there, in the same way that there are some lousy mechanics, doctors, and librarians. I don't for one second take that to mean that mechanics, doctors, and librarians *in general* are all worthless.\n\nAnd like any other science, accountability is provided via peer review and repeatability. If you doubt the claims of any political science research, you or anyone else is welcome to provide counter-evidence. Do you have an example of a claim you doubt? \n\n&gt; Political Science is the dispensing of preceptive methods which are loaded with value judgments.These value judgments include which facts and disciplines are relevant; when is new knowledge reliable enough for use; which dissenting viewpoints deserve to be heard; and when is action appropriate. Consequently, political science conclusions can never be entirely apart from politics.\n\nFirst, questions like \"when is new knowledge reliable enough for use\" and \"when is action appropriate\" are not, generally speaking, questions of political science. Those are normative judgments, not empirical questions. This is the difference between the scientist studying heart disease and the doctor who must ultimately prescribe treatments. Political scientists provide the raw knowledge and information that permits decision-makers to make better-informed decisions.\n\nSecond, if you're saying scientists' opinions and values are a potential challenge to objective research, I agree to an extent. But if you read Kuhn or Lakatos, the same is true of science in general. If you're categorically throwing out all research related to things people have opinions and \"value judgments\" about, I'm afraid you're not left with much knowledge at all. No scientist -- even biologists and physicists -- can ever be truly unbiased about their work, but the scientific method and peer review at least provide us with a *process* that has proven to be more objective than any other process anyone has thought of so far. \n\n&gt; In free societies, no group of should be beyond critical analysis. If judges, senators and presidents may not presume to stand above the law, still less should political scientists seek to muffle themselves from scrutiny of their adjudication. \n\n???\n\nNo scientist of any kind -- including political science -- claims to be \"beyond critical analysis.\" In fact, the entire scientific enterprise is built around making falsifiable predictions, subjecting them to the most rigorous scrutiny possible, and opening it up for those who disagree to do the same. \n\n&gt; We do not need political scientists to give their determinations based on their \"empirical\" evidence.\n\nI have no idea how that conclusion follows logically from what preceded it -- it's a big leap from \"political science is not exempt from scrutiny\" to \"political science is useless.\"\n\nNor do I understand why you think the word empirical belongs in quotes, implying that you doubt whether political science research is rigorous or empirical enough. Do you have an example of research that is widely accepted within political science that does not stand up to your scrutiny? If so, can you explain why it is inferior? Or are you merely making blanket statements dismissing an entire scientific discipline with which you have less than even a passing familiarity?", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Disingenuous.

What pedestal? My claim was that there are good and bad political scientists just like any other profession, that we have the same accountability processes as other scientific disciplines, and that the scientific method, while imperfect, is probably the best process we've found so far. Which part of that do you dispute?\n\n&gt; I would suggest you read the following exposition. King, Gary. How Not to Lie With Statistics: Avoiding Common Mistakes in Quantitative Political Science. American Journal of Political Science 30: 666\u2013687. I will succinctly paraphrase his point. King esposes a set of crucial analytical errors manifesting with bothersomely consequential recurrency throughout the calculable political science discussion. These inaccuracies are all based on deficient statistical theory or on flawed statistical examination. \n\nAs a methods minor who passed my comprehensive exams, I am already quite familiar with that article and the rest of Gary King's work. And ... it doesn't prove your point in the least. King, if you didn't know, is himself a political scientist and a \"quant\" -- perhaps the most prominent and revered of all quants in the entire discipline, in fact. The AJPS article you cite does *not* condemn political science or empirical research in general. Rather, it explains many common mistakes people make in practice, in order to help political scientists conduct more appropriate tests and draw more valid conclusions from their results. Naturally, lots of political scientists have gotten things wrong in the past, just as physicists have been wrong about the laws of motion and astronomers have been wrong about the geocentric universe. \n\nBut guess what? In the article you cited, Gary King is *providing the exact accountability you asked about earlier*! If one scientist gets something wrong, other scientists can point out what they did wrong, and potentially get their counterarguments published in a top academic journal (AJPS is generally considered #2 behind APSR). Unknowingly, you've provided an example of the scientific process working *exactly as it should*.\n\n&gt; I just do not believe in the finality of determinations made by political scientists. \n\nHuh? Neither do political scientists. All scientific propositions are tentative and are rejected or revised when faced with counter-evidence. What exactly do you think science *is*?\n\n&gt; Ask Mitt Romney if he still believes in their judgements.\n\nI really don't understand what you mean by this. Which political science \"judgments\" steered Romney wrong? As you can see [here](http://www.voteseeing.com/2012/11/2012-presidential-prediction-rankings.html) the top political science prognosticators predicted the 2012 election almost spot on (note that Simon Jackman is a well known political science prof at Stanford, while Nate Silver is an economist and the son of MSU poli sci professor Brian Silver), but most mainstream media prognosticators were dead wrong.\n\n&gt; That was quite Stalinesque on your part to attribute quotes to me that I never said. Maybe you have learned well, or that just reflects the political leanings of your own mentors.\n\nLOL, what? Pot, kettle, black, and all that ... interesting choice to make a hilariously absurd ad hominem attack just one paragraph before complaining about a perceived personal attack.\n\n&gt; Why the personal attack?\n\nI didn't think it was a personal attack. I simply *asked* you which one was the case -- do you have an example (if so, please provide it), or don't you (if so, why are you making blanket statements with nothing to back it up)? Can we surmise from your over the top, knee-jerk defensiveness that you didn't really have such an example in mind?\n\n&gt; Exactly what makes me a bit nervous about political scientists. \n\nSo what, in your mind, makes political scientists different from any other scientists? As I mentioned earlier, pre-conceived biases and \"value judgments\" exist in every single field, including economics, physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, astronomy, and meteorology. In fact, that is the entire reason the scientific method and peer review exist. \n\n&gt; Of which, I am one by the way.\n\nReally? Great!

I would like to refer you to an article that appeared in the New York Times on June 24th, 2012 written by Jacqueline Stevens, a well reknown and respected Professor of Political Science at Northwestern University http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/opinion/sunday/political-scientists-are-lousy-forecasters.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0  She details in no uncertain terms the problems and shortcomings of Political science. Quite honestly it is a damning indictment of the political science profession and the A.P.S.A as well. In one segment Stevens discusses the work of Political Psychologist Philip E. Tetlock in the 1980's. Tetlock began systematically quizzing 284 political experts \u2014 most of whom were political science Ph.D.\u2019s \u2014 on dozens of basic questions, like whether a country would go to war, leave NATO or change its boundaries or a political leader would remain in office. \nTetlock found that Chimps randomly throwing darts at the possible outcomes fared just slightly lower than the experts. I also would suggest you read (in between classes of course) the July 2012 edition of The Economist http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2012/07/political-science  This article offers another scathing rebuke of Political Science. Mostly questioning the legitimacy of it as a true \"science\". I know this will probably infuriate you, given your copious allusions to the \"science\" portion of political science in your prior posts. Do not feel threatened by the numerous esteemed political scientists and scholars who vehemently support my position (I could provide a multitude more). I understand your side, I've heard it for years. But you and your future constituents will be better served, if you accepted the genuineness of the opposing argument and not get lost in the self absorbed scholarly world you are living in. Reality will bite you if you fail to recognize it. Political Scientists are valuable tools, but they are not the final nor absolute word. And all would be better off if we called ourselves Political Academicians. The science argument is lost.Yeah, I like that.

You asked a question regarding wealth and wealth redistribution on a academic subreddit focused on politics. When asked what you were referring to with the term wealth, which is a legitimate question that scholars might ask, you seemed to get offended. I then defended the question about wealth (because again, most scholars would ask for clarification) and delineated different types of wealth which might be factored into a general definition. Now you say my response was disingenuous because I pointed out something that is considered to be a legitimate academic inquiry. It seems to me you are asking a politically-charged question and then getting offended when you don't receive politically-charged answers. Again, this is an *academic* forum and not a politically-charged place of discussion (see /r/conservatives, /r/Liberal, /r/Libertarian, etc). \n\nYou asked how the government can generate wealth without redistributing wealth. Most scholars would see this question and ask 'what definition of wealth is being discussed here?' Specifically, since you said 'without redistributing wealth,' one might infer that you are approaching wealth with a more broad definition. The mere closeness in relation between social capital, money, human capital and so on (one with a higher income might be assumed to enjoy higher levels of social capital) further supports the notion that wealth is not easily defined. \n\nWith all of that aside (and with your question clarified as 'how can the government generate monetary wealth without redistributing monetary wealth?') you might want to specify even further. Specifically, are you asking how the government can create monetary wealth in the *aggregate* or for *individuals*? I would assume that you are referencing the latter simply because that is whom monetary wealth is usually redistributed to. With this, I'm not really sure how the government could increase monetary wealth for individuals without redistributing said wealth (at least directly). Perhaps certain economic policies could inflate the value of money and in effect increase someone's wealth. I won't really go further in trying to answer the question as guidelines of this subreddit prohibit layman speculation (and my field does not cover this, in effect making me a layman on the topic).

It is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.\n\nNat'l Fed'n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 132 S. Ct. 2566, 2579, 183 L. Ed. 2d 450 (2012)\n\nBasic foundation of judicial review, but to avoid judicial activism.  The court cannot change the PPACA from a use of the commerce clause to a use of the taxing power.  \n\nAnd thus: \n\n&gt;The text of a statute can sometimes have more than one possible meaning. To take a familiar example, a law that reads \u201cno vehicles in the park\u201d might, or might not, ban bicycles in the park. And it is well established that if a statute has two possible meanings, one of which violates the Constitution, courts should adopt the meaning that does not do so. Justice Story said that 180 years ago: \u201cNo court ought, unless the terms of an act rendered it unavoidable, to give a construction to it which should involve a violation, however unintentional, of the constitution.\u201d Parsons v. Bedford, 3 Pet. 433, 448\u2013449, 7 L.Ed. 732 (1830). Justice Holmes made the same point a century later: \u201c[T]he rule is settled that as between two possible interpretations of a statute, by one of which it would be unconstitutional and by the other valid, our plain duty is to adopt that which will save the Act.\n\nNat'l Fed'n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 132 S. Ct. 2566, 2593, 183 L. Ed. 2d 450 (2012)\n\n\nThis is the presumption of constitutionality which CJ Roberts used to get an anti-commerce-clause decision dressed as something the President and the Congress would swallow.  \n\n&gt;But, for the reasons explained above, the Commerce Clause does not give Congress that power. Under our precedent, it is therefore necessary to ask whether the Government's alternative reading of the statute\u2014that it only imposes a tax on those without insurance\u2014is a reasonable one.\n\nNat'l Fed'n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 132 S. Ct. 2566, 2593, 183 L. Ed. 2d 450 (2012)\n\nIf it's reasonably possible they could have passed this as a tax... this is a very low standard (too low IMHO).  \n\n\nAnd finally, as I said: \n\n&gt;The question is not whether that is the most natural interpretation of the mandate, but only whether it is a \u201cfairly possible\u201d one. Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 62, 52 S.Ct. 285, 76 L.Ed. 598 (1932). As we have explained, \u201cevery reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality.\u201d Hooper v. California, 155 U.S. 648, 657, 15 S.Ct. 207, 39 L.Ed. 297 (1895). The Government asks us to interpret the mandate as imposing a tax, if it would otherwise violate the Constitution. Granting the Act the full measure of deference owed to federal statutes, it can be so read, for the reasons set forth below.\n\nNat'l Fed'n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 132 S. Ct. 2566, 2594, 183 L.

FEDN. OF INDEP. BUSINESS v. Sebelius\n\nSection III\n\n&gt;The Government advances two theories for the proposition that Congress had constitutional authority to enact the individual mandate. First, the Government argues that Congress had the power to enact the mandate under the Commerce Clause. Under that theory, Congress may order individuals to buy health insurance because the failure to do so affects interstate commerce, and could undercut the Affordable Care Act's other reforms. Second, **the Government argues that if the commerce power does not support the mandate, we should nonetheless uphold it as an exercise of Congress's power to tax.** According to the Government, even if Congress lacks the power to direct individuals to buy insurance, the only effect of the individual mandate is to raise taxes on those who do not do so, and thus the law may be upheld as a tax.\n\nIII.C\n\n&gt;The Affordable Care Act's requirement that certain individuals pay a financial penalty for not obtaining health insurance may reasonably be characterized as a tax. Because the Constitution permits such a tax. it is not our role to forbid it, or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness.\n\nIII.D\n\n&gt;The Federal Government does not have the power to order people to buy health insurance. Section 5000A would therefore be unconstitutional if read as a command. The Federal Government does have the power to impose a tax on those without health insurance. Section 5000A is therefore constitutional, because it can reasonably be read as a tax.\n\nhttp://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11973730494168859869&amp;q=NATIONAL+FEDERATION+OF+INDEPENDENT+BUSINESS+V.+SEBELIUS&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,50&amp;as_vis=1", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_19buh9", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8mx5at", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1362011421", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c8mw5vu", "parent_id": "t1_c8mndg6", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431431688, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Close, but you're stating a common error:  it was not \"upheld\" under the tax and spend power.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Here is how it breaks down. The results of sequestration will be across the board funding cuts to all discretionary federal spending. There will be a 9.2% cut from all non-exempt defense spending (military entitlements and war spending are exempt from these cuts). Additionally there will be a 8.2% cut from all other federal non-defense non-exempt spending. Each of the Department of Education, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Energy, and literary every other federal program will each lose 8.2% of their budget.\n\nThese cuts cannot be transferred or mitigated. So for example they could not choose to have The Department of Education only lose 4.1% while the Department of Energy loses 12.3%. Everyone loses 8.2% (9.4 for Defense) of their budget, period. These cuts only apply to the total yearly budgets of the departments. It will be up to each one individually to make their own adjustments for the reduced funding. If the Department of Energy wants to lay off employees to offset the difference, they can. If they want to reduce subsidies they can do that too. It is completely up to each Department as to how they want to handle the budget change.\n\nSo to break it down, tomorrow all discretionary government programs lose 8.2%(9.4%) of their yearly budget. They do not have to cut 8.2%(9.4%) tomorrow. They will just have less money to finish out the next 10 months. \n\n**What has to be done to prevent sequestration.**\n\nTo prevent these measure from going into effect congress must pass $1.2 trillion dollars of deficit reduction (spending cuts or tax increases) over the next ten years. As soon as Congress passes the $1.2 Trillion dollars in deficit reduction the sequestration measures end, even if sequestration has already gone into effect. As an example sequestration goes into effect tomorrow and everyone gets a budget cut. In two weeks congress passes the required $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction. As soon as the measure is signed into law the federal programs get back all of the money they lose from sequestration (shy of what may be cut with the new deficit reduction measure).

The US was going to hit the debt ceiling again and congressional Republicans wanted spending cuts tied to any increase in the debt ceiling. The negotiation that came out of this was the Budget Control Act of 2011. This act mandated that by December 31st of 2012 Congress would have to pass deficit reduction measures in the amount of $1.2-$1.5 trillion dollars over the next 10 years (2013-2023). If by January 1st 2013 these deficit reduction measures were not passed then sequestration measure would into effect and across the board cuts to defense and domestic spending would take place. All of this was in the text of the Budget Control Act of 2011.\n\nAfter the BCA went into law a \"Super Committee\" was formed consisting of 6 Republicans and 6 Democrats with the purpose of putting forth a bill that would achieve the legally required deficit reduction.

Would you like me to go through the trouble of explaining precisely why that *cannot* be a correct interpretation of the 2nd amendment, or would you like to simply trust that I, as a linguist, probably know what I'm talking about?\n\n---\nEDIT: Since I have had ~~an asshole demand~~ someone request the explanation I offered, here it is:\n\nFirst, the [syntax tree of the text of the 2nd Amendment.](http://i.imgur.com/1tcfRAth.png)\n\nYou'll notice that the reference to the militia is way the heck off on the left, in S2, far removed from the \"right,\" NP5 in S3, yet that right is directly modified by the phrase \"of the people\" to form NP8.  This is the exact same construction as \"my error\" or \"your response,\" which clearly shows that the right belongs to the people.  This is support for the individual right interpretation, unless you mean to contend that throughout the bill of rights \"the people\" has a collectivist meaning.  Before you make that assertion, however, let's look at the effects of that:  \n\n(2) The right to bear arms would not be held by the individual, but by the National Guard, etc.   But...   \n(1) The right to petition for redress of grievances against the government could likewise be limited to some, government organized group  \n(4) The 4th could be cited to protect government Classified information but not your private information.  \n(9) The government would be able to define the groups that had additional rights  \n(10) Any power not already allocated would be... allocated at the whim of the government?\n\nIs that really a sensible set of interpretations? In as much as I believe not, in as much as the courts have consistently ruled that \"the people\" refers to the individual, that means that the right is an individual's, not a group's.  What's more, I cannot find any valid structure that links \"right\" to \"militia\" without first being linked to \"the people\"\n\n---\nNext, we will look at the relation between the Militia clause and the Operative clause.\n\nClearly, the militia clause is an explanatory statement, giving the reasons as to why the right is protected.  The question, however, is whether the right, as protected by the 2nd Amendment, is contingent on that reasoning.  One test to determine the relation between two sentences is the Negation Test, wherein you negate each of the sentences in turn.  If there is a contradiction, then the sentences are inextricably linked. Let's try that.\n\n1. [A well regulated militia not being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.](http://i.imgur.com/aK3euBoh.png) \n2. [A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms may be infringed.](http://i.imgur.com/SoxAuWxh.png)\n3. [A well regulated militia not being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms may be infringed.](http://i.imgur.com/JJfLGb5h.png)\n\nNow, the question is what is the meaning of these different phrasings.  In each of them, the right is that of the individual, but the reasoning changes.  In (1), we've negated the necessity of the well regulated militia.  My reading of this is that because a militia is not necessary, or does not need to be well regulated, individuals are allowed to keep and bear arms.  It's odd, but not contradictory.\n\nIn version (2), we have the sentence that the collectivists want to believe the 2nd amendment actually reads. In it, you have a necessary militia, and as a result of that, the state can infringe on the rights of the people.  This, to my mind, proves that that interpretation is the *exact opposite* of the terms dictated by the operative clause.  I even see its appeal, but that doesn't change the fact that that is in direct conflict with what the amendment says.\n\nIn version (3), we find the same sort of link as was asserted by [George Mason](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mason), that the militia is, by definition, the people, and since they are not necessary aspect of the state, the right to arms may be limited.  Again, this is the exact opposite of the mandate of the amendment.\n\nSo, we have (2) and (3) reversing the mandate, and (1) maintaining it in the same form as the actual amendment.  Because the meaning of the versions which negated the Militia clause match the non-negated version ([2,3] vs [O,1]), rather than matching each other ([1,3] vs [O,2]), it is clear that the militia clause can be severed from the *effect* of the law.\n\n---\nFinally, let's look at the concept of severability.\n\nIs there a difference in the rammifications of the following statements, with respect to the right asserted:\n\n\n* A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\n* The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\n\nI assert, based on the above work, and my native speaker intuition, that there is not a difference.  Additional evidence for this is in the interpretation of another document written about a decade and a half earlier, drafted by many of the same people: [The Declaration of Independence.](http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html) \n\nIn that document, you have 4 paragraphs and 27 listed grievances giving the reasoning for the actual declaration of independence in the final paragraph, with the preceding text being explicitly acknowledged as the reasoning for the declaration.  If the effect of the second clause of the 2nd Amendment can be nullified by a change in circumstances underlying the reasoning, could not the Crown legally reassert dominion over its former colonies now that many of the grievances no longer hold?  After all, it's been something like 200 years since troops have been quartered in the US, and the Queen does not behave in any way like a Tyrant; the vast majority of the reasoning, a large number of the grievances, are no longer valid.\n\nSo it brings the question, is a spech act, be it a declaration, or an enactment of law, valid beyond the reasoning behind it?  Is it severable from the rest of the passage? I maintain that it is.", "id": "t1_c84jyr7", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "PerspicaciousPedant", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; would you like to simply trust that I, as a linguist, probably know what I'm talking about?\n\nBecause a linguist knows better about constitutional law and politics than a political scientist?

This final extremely high deficit was cause by the financial collapse of 2008. This gives us two ways of looking at it and each give you a different picture.\n\nFirst is comparing Obama's average yearly deficits to the average yearly deficits of Bush. The average Bush deficit for his Presidency is apx $443 Billion dollars per year. The average Obama deficit for his Presidency so far has been $1.15 Trillion.\n\nSecond is comparing Obama's starting deficit to where we are today. Bush's last budget was $1.4 Trillion and the 2012 deficit was only $1.1 trillion, a decrease of $300 Billion.\n\nSo Obama has increased the deficit per year at 2.5X the rate of Bush, but he has reduced the deficit from when he took office.

Once they have started the process they will be given a temporary visa for a length of time appropriate for completing the citizenship requirements.\n\nStep 3: After the amnesty period is over strong laws go into place regarding illegals in the country. Illegals will no longer receive any form of aid from the government, companies that knowingly hire illegals will face large fines and loss of business licenses, and it will be illegal to rent or sell housing to illegals.
