But starting off, I do agree with you that China will most likely not want to enter the fray.\n\nBut one thing I do need to point out is that there are fundamental reasons counter to your ideas of how a post-Kim regime North Korea would develop. A Chinese lead development is fundamentally unreasonable, to all involved parties.\n\nChina\n\nStarting with China, China's ultimate goal has been economic growth \u2014 the single most powerful reason why the CCP is currently in power. \n\nChinese citizens tolerate the CCP to a degree because their standard of life is undoubtedly increasing, regardless of political freedoms that are denied. This is a pretty common analysis among geopolitical experts.\n\nThrowing North Korea into that economic engine throws back Chinese growth for a few decades at least. This is a hugely underdeveloped region with massive economic needs. The costs will be immense, even for China. Any dip in Chinese economic growth is likely to threaten the CCP's very existence and political legitimacy.\n\nNorth Korea\n\nThen looking at North Korea itself, North Koreans would be absolutely furious being a Chinese province (or even a puppet state). They would go absolutely ballistic.\n\nThe entirety of the North Korean state and philosophy is ethnic Korean sovereignty. That is the guiding principle of the entire country and one that North Koreans take very seriously even if they may disregard the more imaginative propaganda (discovering unicorn lairs, etc.).\n\nTo understand North Korea you need to understand North Korean history. I can elaborate more if you wish but just keep in mind that becoming a state under Chinese administration would result in unbelievable fury. North Korean ideology is guided primarily by racial sovereignty, not economic policy (that is, the difference between communism and capitalism \u2014 this is a secondary concern).\n\nSouth Korea taking over the North can conform to that innate North Korean desire, whereas China couldn't even if it wanted to. And given China's constant headaches in Tibet and Uighur areas, I'm not sure they want to add to that with North Korea.\n\nSouth Korea\n\nSouth Korea is the country most able (given not only economic but political considerations) to absorb North Korea in the eventual fall of the Kim regime.\n\nI mentioned economic growth being stalled for a few decades as a problem for China and the CCP's ruling legitimacy. While it will cause similar headaches for the S. Korean governmental administration, it's not a factor that would completely destabilize their rule and result in a collapse of government.\n\nThe S. Korean government's legitimacy comes from the political institutions and the vote of the people. The CCP does not have that. Its legitimacy stems from improved standards of living and economic growth. As such, S. Korean governmental capacities are far sturdier and more suited for absorbing the North Korean state.\n\nSecondly, as I've mentioned, there is far more chance of peace in a unified Korean state than a Chinese maintained North Korea due to racial homogeneity.\n\nWith this allowing for more stable economic growth in North Korea, a region like North Korea can result in a unified Korea's GDP to be greater than that of Japan's or Germany's within three or four decades. Korea has the political stability to wait that long. China does not.\n\nThe United States\n\nThe US would be absolutely suicidal to negotiate away North Korea like that. For one, it guarantees that their presence in the Korean peninsula will be effectively eliminated.\n\nThe purpose of USFK and the S. Korean\u2014US mutual defense treaty is to be present when war (inevitably) breaks out in the Korean peninsula and to secure S. Korean territory. S. Korea considers the entirety of the Korean peninsula (legally) to be under their domain.\n\nFailure to live up to the most crucial part of the alliance results in a disintegration of the alliance entirely. South Korea will be furious if the US fails to live up to their side of the deal. The US immediately loses one of their most important Asian allies and will be forced to leave the peninsula.\n\nThis wreaks havoc on many parts of US foreign policy. For one, they've now lost a pivotal foothold in the Pacific. Two, they've sent a message to all their allies that the US does not respect and keep its promises. This is a problem in Asia, especially where territorial disputes are hot button issues. Will Japan trust the US when it comes to Senkaku? Can potential ally Vietnam trust the US? The Philippines? So on and so forth. It structurally weakens American alliances in the entire region and destroys America's goal of \"pivoting\" towards Asia.\n\nThen comes the inevitable nuclearization of S. Korea once they force the US to leave. S. Korea is expected to be able to build nuclear weapons within 6 months. Neighboring Japan can do it even faster. This will undoubtedly lead to a major arms race in the region and destabilize the region even further, spilling into more \"hot\" conflicts.\n\nDon't even get me started on what kind of signal it sends to non-Pacific allies. They'll be just as spooked. In short, it weakens the very foundation of American abilities to globally power project and emboldens China who knows America will cave.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c94xqnh", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364602411", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "SupraMario", "id": "t1_c94g5s2", "parent_id": "t3_1b7enh", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431743459, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c94g5s2", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364529053", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}
