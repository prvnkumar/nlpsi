If voter fraud was a widespread or undermined the general public's confidence in our election system, then you'd have a controlling state interest.  \n\nnow, on the other hand, you have licensing and registration, which brings with it fees.  let's start with the basics.\n\n\"Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court\u2019s opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms\" (DC. V. Heller)\n\nthe need to regulate firearms in order to effectively prohibit \"the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill\" and to ensure the \"laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms\" is \"longstanding\" and a controlling state interest.  now, along with that comes with fees. those are inevitable and as long as not so much to be considered \"egregious\" are simply part of doing business.  and even if they were, they have a \"controlling state interest\" that precludes it from being disenfranchisment. \n\n\nthe larger problem, and i thought about it a lot, and asked around, is i found that guns are literally the ONLY tangible thing you have a right to in the Constitution.  consequently you can make all kinds of statements that literally CAN'T be proven wrong, not because they're solid arguments, but by accident of history.  that's why i couldn't get any other right to slip into your point and have it make sense.  i tried, but alas they couldn't hold. If you think my point is bogus, you could certainly try to find some way to make your statement make sense with anything other than guns.  write it out so i can read it too.  \n", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "id": "t1_c9ga4m6", "parent_id": "t1_c9g5qw0", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431538906, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9ga4m6", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366121887", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "y8909", "id": "t1_c9g5qw0", "parent_id": "t1_c9g442a", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431541042, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ce4q9", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9g5qw0", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366094600", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "id": "t1_c9g442a", "parent_id": "t1_c9g1tjq", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431541811, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ce4q9", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9g442a", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366087920", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "y8909", "id": "t1_c9g1tjq", "parent_id": "t1_c9g109t", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431542892, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9g1tjq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366081167", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "id": "t1_c9g109t", "parent_id": "t1_c9fy8jy", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431543275, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ce4q9", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9g109t", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366079032", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "y8909", "id": "t1_c9fy8jy", "parent_id": "t1_c9fthnf", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431544652, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ce4q9", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9fy8jy", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366071664", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "id": "t1_c9fthnf", "parent_id": "t1_c9foi4e", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431546890, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ce4q9", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9fthnf", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366058233", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "y8909", "id": "t1_c9foi4e", "parent_id": "t1_c9fneu3", "score": 11, "retrieved_on": 1431549316, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ce4q9", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9foi4e", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366045272", "distinguished": null, "ups": 11}

The Commerce Clause which originally existed only to stop the absurd tariff wars between the states and simplify international trade was created on a positive action economic basis. You had to do something for it to be applicable and it had to cross state lines (make goods, sell to neighbor in other state). Then they argued that if you committed a negative economic action that would have otherwise been a positive one or have a similar effect regarding interstate trade it fell under it (make goods for sale, but instead of selling it across state lines you use it/destroy it). We're already in crazy territory here since this pretty much means anything you do anywhere is subject to interstate commerce because the market exists over multiple states. Then they pushed it further and said a positive non-action is also subject (so non-commercial activity where you make something for the exclusive purpose of your own use is now interstate commerce). Dig a ditch on your own property? That is now within the scope of the federal government.\n\nACA took the final quadrant and said negative non-action is subject. So by not engaging in economic activity for no purpose everything can be subject to federal law.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing stopping the federal government from claiming power to do anything (because remember that they can ban ownership of items and activity [and non-activity] via the commerce clause).\n\n&gt; and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States\".\n\n**AND PROVIDE**.

That would also mean, I don't want police having them, and I don't want secret service having them, because if no one has them, then there is no need. Until the president rids his secret service, that protects his family, of any guns, I don't think anyone else should have to lose theirs. I say this because the UK has pretty low crime rates, no guns, and their officers don't use guns either.

You can't fire a warning shot because firing a warning shot shows that he is not an imminent threat. Let's translate that to the gun debate: you might feel threatened by the fact that I own guns (or certain guns, or certain accessories like a magazine with a certain capacity). So what? The fact that I own guns is not an imminent threat to anyone. If it *becomes* an imminent threat, my guns *can* be taken away; for instance, if I'm accused of stalking someone, she might get a restraining order. \n\n&gt;By the way, Court cases only rise when a right is violated.

Your argument shows a serious misunderstanding of how rights work in the American legal system.\n\nAre you saying that, while everybody has a right to safety, it's never been violated? That's ridiculous. In Warren v DC, the SCOTUS ruled that the police only have a duty to protect an individual if a \"special relationship exists\". Even if there's a restraining order, the police cannot be sued for failing to protect an individual (Castle Rock v Gonzales). It is not the government's duty to protect you from everything that could go wrong.\n\n&gt;pursuing and obtaining safety\n\nHaving the right to pursue and obtain safety is not the same as having the right to feel safe. When it comes to guns, trying to get an Assault Weapon Ban passed is not pursuing or obtaining safety; the DoJ said that the effect of the 1994 AWB was too small to measure. Therefore, an Assault Weapon Ban merely makes you *feel* safer. You do *not* have a right to *feel* safer, though you might (if you live in CA) have the right to *pursue* and *obtain* safety (for instance, by shooting a burglar who is an *imminent* threat to your safety).", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Kaluthir", "id": "t1_c93zfgi", "parent_id": "t1_c93ywct", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431730383, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93zfgi", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364475795", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Dennis_Langley", "id": "t1_c93ywct", "parent_id": "t1_c93svvk", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431730145, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93ywct", "author_flair_text": "[PhD Candidate:Voting and Ideology][Liberal]", "created_utc": "1364472897", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Kaluthir", "id": "t1_c93svvk", "parent_id": "t1_c93rzyh", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431727174, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93svvk", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364439666", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Dennis_Langley", "id": "t1_c93rzyh", "parent_id": "t1_c93r2re", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1435561177, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93rzyh", "author_flair_text": "[PhD Candidate:Voting and Ideology][Liberal]", "created_utc": "1364437117", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Kaluthir", "id": "t1_c93r2re", "parent_id": "t1_c93kflw", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431726332, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1b46fm", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93r2re", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364434365", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Dennis_Langley", "id": "t1_c93kflw", "parent_id": "t1_c93jrb0", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1431723087, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93kflw", "author_flair_text": "[PhD Candidate:Voting and Ideology][Liberal]", "created_utc": "1364415716", "distinguished": null, "ups": 3}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Kaluthir", "id": "t1_c93jrb0", "parent_id": "t1_c93jh9j", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431722742, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1b46fm", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93jrb0", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364413965", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Dennis_Langley", "id": "t1_c93jh9j", "parent_id": "t1_c93gkf3", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431722601, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1b46fm", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93jh9j", "author_flair_text": "[PhD Candidate:Voting and Ideology][Liberal]", "created_utc": "1364413258", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Kaluthir", "id": "t1_c93gkf3", "parent_id": "t1_c93fng8", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431721047, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93gkf3", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364405628", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Dennis_Langley", "id": "t1_c93fng8", "parent_id": "t1_c93flkk", "score": 5, "retrieved_on": 1431720609, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93fng8", "author_flair_text": "[PhD Candidate:Voting and Ideology][Liberal]", "created_utc": "1364403092", "distinguished": null, "ups": 5}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "y8909", "id": "t1_c93flkk", "parent_id": "t1_c93f9if", "score": -1, "retrieved_on": 1431720584, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93flkk", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364402947", "distinguished": null, "ups": -1}

Laws derive their power from the ability of their creator and executors to point to where they are entrusted with the power to create and enforce such laws.\n\nAgain, the constitution is just a piece of paper. It holds no power. It has no consciousness. There are no absolutes in lawmaking. Texts get reinterpreted, changed, and destroyed. Just because I write on a document: \"This can never be changed and is true for everybody.\" and 12(?) people sign it, doesn't mean that it is. It's true because it isn't too great an inconvenience for most people. Even if you sign to it, contracts get breached all the time. If both sides don't care than there are no consequences. It is true that some people only care because it's written on a piece of paper. But once enough people don't, they don't matter. I know you mean it in abstract way when you say that it gives power, but many people seem to forget that it's just a piece of paper. If you believe in something because it was constitutional, you're saying imo \"I have no other reason than that I like it that way for personal reasons\". For gun laws that certainly holds true for many people. I don't know what channels you have to go through legally to change your (the U.S.) constitution. It's not impossible is it? At least appending is?\n\n&gt; It only goes in one direction.

As guns become irrationally harder to procure the number of people with real experience shrinks dramatically as the older generations die off.\n\n&gt; (Ratchet effect)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet_effect]\n\nSo there are subjective reasons you believe that? I was wondering. The wiki talks about a lot of other things. There is no real ratchet effect in law making, other than that laws are going in a certain direction just as the world is going in a certain direction. The world is ever changing and the idea of a ratchet effect seems a lot like subjective evidence (is that the right word). Is that word used a lot (Ratchet effect)? Rights can be lost and given. If more rights are lost than given, there can be an abundance of reasons (chance for example), but mostly because laws are unspecific and people use loopholes or new things develop and laws have to adapt.\n\n&gt; And yeah: \"modifying\" right is removing them. The only people who talk of \"modifying\" rights are people who want to strip them away. Remember, we're not removing your right to free speech, we're just modifying it so everyone can feel safe: no bad language, nothing that can make people upset, nothing counter-cultural, and naturally no criticisms of the government.\n\nRights are strengthened too. I won't name any examples because I'm on my phone and I don't really know too much about legal decisions in the US and you wouldn't be interested in German decisions.\n\n&gt; Sure, so why isn't her right to own the tools she needs to survive withheld from her out of fear that they might, possibly, and statistically unlikely, hurt someone else?\n\nBecause, and that is my reason I don't want guns in untrained (and even hobby-like trained) hands around me, because she can use that gun to very easily kill me, without even wanting to. Yes, there are other ways I could die without someone wanting me to. But I'm trying to minimize that while still living a normal life. You are talking how it is statistically unlikely she will, it is just as statistically unlikely someone else will want to hurt her and that she can use that weapon to stop him, if not even more unlikely. The balance is very slightly tipped in favor of the mother being allowed to kill her own child to save her own life. In the same way it is tipped against just anyone being allowed to carry a gun. I think all this debate comes from people that like the power and/or need to feel some mostly false sense of security. My uncle once moved from a very nice house to one not so nice because his neighbor had a pit-bull. While I can understand why he is afraid, the fear is irrational and it cost him a lot. The same goes for gun rights in my opinion. It basically boils down to this: \"I understand your fear. I just think it is irrational and not helping. The same way I understand my own fear of guns around me and know it is irrational and not helping.\"\n\nEdit: Had a bug with my phone. So I couldn't continue writing.

Laws derive their power from the ability of their creator and executors to point to where they are entrusted with the power to create and enforce such laws.\n\nAgain, the constitution is just a piece of paper. It holds no power. It has no consciousness. There are no absolutes in lawmaking. Texts get reinterpreted, changed, and destroyed. Just because I write on a document: \"This can never be changed and is true for everybody.\" and 12(?) people sign it, doesn't mean that it is. It's true because it isn't too great an inconvenience for most people. Even if you sign to it, contracts get breached all the time. If both sides don't care than there are no consequences. It is true that some people only care because it's written on a piece of paper. But once enough people don't, they don't matter. I know you mean it in abstract way when you say that it gives power, but many people seem to forget that it's just a piece of paper. If you believe in something because it was constitutional, you're saying imo \"I have no other reason than that I like it that way for personal reasons\". For gun laws that certainly holds true for many people. I don't know what channels you have to go through legally to change your (the U.S.) constitution. It's not impossible is it? At least appending is?\n\n&gt; It only goes in one direction. Especially when it comes to gun rights, once you cross a certain threshold there is no going back, people are stupid and easily scared so they can be browbeaten into thinking guns are evil and scary like in the movies and lack of real experience means they will never change their mind. As guns become irrationally harder to procure the number of people with real experience shrinks dramatically as the older generations die off.\n\n&gt; (Ratchet effect)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet_effect]\n\nSo there are subjective reasons you believe that? I was wondering. The wiki talks about a lot of other things. There is no real ratchet effect in law making, other than that laws are going in a certain direction just as the world is going in a certain direction. The world is ever changing and the idea of a ratchet effect seems a lot like subjective evidence (is that the right word). Is that word used a lot (Ratchet effect)? Rights can be lost and given. If more rights are lost than given, there can be an abundance of reasons (chance for example), but mostly because laws are unspecific and people use loopholes or new things develop and laws have to adapt.\n\n&gt; And yeah: \"modifying\" right is removing them. The only people who talk of \"modifying\" rights are people who want to strip them away. Remember, we're not removing your right to free speech, we're just modifying it so everyone can feel safe: no bad language, nothing that can make people upset, nothing counter-cultural, and naturally no criticisms of the government.\n\nRights are strengthened too. I won't name any examples because I'm on my phone and I don't really know too much about legal decisions in the US and you wouldn't be interested in German decisions.\n\n&gt; Sure, so why isn't her right to own the tools she needs to survive withheld from her out of fear that they might, possibly, and statistically unlikely, hurt someone else?\n\nBecause, and that is my reason I don't want guns in untrained (and even hobby-like trained) hands around me, because she can use that gun to very easily kill me, without even wanting to. Yes, there are other ways I could die without someone wanting me to. But I'm trying to minimize that while still living a normal life. You are talking how it is statistically unlikely she will, it is just as statistically unlikely someone else will want to hurt her and that she can use that weapon to stop him, if not even more unlikely. The balance is very slightly tipped in favor of the mother being allowed to kill her own child to save her own life. In the same way it is tipped against just anyone being allowed to carry a gun. I think all this debate comes from people that like the power and/or need to feel some mostly false sense of security. My uncle once moved from a very nice house to one not so nice because his neighbor had a pit-bull. While I can understand why he is afraid, the fear is irrational and it cost him a lot. The same goes for gun rights in my opinion. It basically boils down to this: \"I understand your fear. I just think it is irrational and not helping. The same way I understand my own fear of guns around me and know it is irrational and not helping.\"\n\nEdit: Had a bug with my phone. So I couldn't continue writing.

Laws derive their power from the ability of their creator and executors to point to where they are entrusted with the power to create and enforce such laws.\n\nAgain, the constitution is just a piece of paper. It holds no power. It has no consciousness. There are no absolutes in lawmaking. Texts get reinterpreted, changed, and destroyed. Just because I write on a document: \"This can never be changed and is true for everybody.\" and 12(?) people sign it, doesn't mean that it is. It's true because it isn't too great an inconvenience for most people. Even if you sign to it, contracts get breached all the time. If both sides don't care than there are no consequences. It is true that some people only care because it's written on a piece of paper. But once enough people don't, they don't matter. I know you mean it in abstract way when you say that it gives power, but many people seem to forget that it's just a piece of paper. If you believe in something because it was constitutional, you're saying imo \"I have no other reason than that I like it that way for personal reasons\". For gun laws that certainly holds true for many people. I don't know what channels you have to go through legally to change your (the U.S.) constitution. It's not impossible is it? At least appending is?\n\n&gt; It only goes in one direction. Especially when it comes to gun rights, once you cross a certain threshold there is no going back, people are stupid and easily scared so they can be browbeaten into thinking guns are evil and scary like in the movies and lack of real experience means they will never change their mind. As guns become irrationally harder to procure the number of people with real experience shrinks dramatically as the older generations die off.\n\n&gt; (Ratchet effect)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet_effect]\n\nSo there are subjective reasons you believe that? I was wondering. The wiki talks about a lot of other things. There is no real ratchet effect in law making, other than that laws are going in a certain direction just as the world is going in a certain direction. The world is ever changing and the idea of a ratchet effect seems a lot like subjective evidence (is that the right word). Is that word used a lot (Ratchet effect)? Rights can be lost and given. If more rights are lost than given, there can be an abundance of reasons (chance for example), but mostly because laws are unspecific and people use loopholes or new things develop and laws have to adapt.\n\n&gt; And yeah: \"modifying\" right is removing them. The only people who talk of \"modifying\" rights are people who want to strip them away. Remember, we're not removing your right to free speech, we're just modifying it so everyone can feel safe: no bad language, nothing that can make people upset, nothing counter-cultural, and naturally no criticisms of the government.\n\nRights are strengthened too. I won't name any examples because I'm on my phone and I don't really know too much about legal decisions in the US and you wouldn't be interested in German decisions.\n\n&gt; Sure, so why isn't her right to own the tools she needs to survive withheld from her out of fear that they might, possibly, and statistically unlikely, hurt someone else?\n\nBecause, and that is my reason I don't want guns in untrained (and even hobby-like trained) hands around me, because she can use that gun to very easily kill me, without even wanting to. Yes, there are other ways I could die without someone wanting me to. But I'm trying to minimize that while still living a normal life. You are talking how it is statistically unlikely she will, it is just as statistically unlikely someone else will want to hurt her and that she can use that weapon to stop him, if not even more unlikely. The balance is very slightly tipped in favor of the mother being allowed to kill her own child to save her own life. In the same way it is tipped against just anyone being allowed to carry a gun. I think all this debate comes from people that like the power and/or need to feel some mostly false sense of security. My uncle once moved from a very nice house to one not so nice because his neighbor had a pit-bull. While I can understand why he is afraid, the fear is irrational and it cost him a lot. The same goes for gun rights in my opinion. It basically boils down to this: \"I understand your fear. I just think it is irrational and not helping. The same way I understand my own fear of guns around me and know it is irrational and not helping.\"\n\nEdit: Had a bug with my phone. So I couldn't continue writing.

Laws derive their power from the ability of their creator and executors to point to where they are entrusted with the power to create and enforce such laws.\n\nAgain, the constitution is just a piece of paper. It holds no power. It has no consciousness. There are no absolutes in lawmaking. Texts get reinterpreted, changed, and destroyed. Just because I write on a document: \"This can never be changed and is true for everybody.\" and 12(?) people sign it, doesn't mean that it is. It's true because it isn't too great an inconvenience for most people. Even if you sign to it, contracts get breached all the time. If both sides don't care than there are no consequences. It is true that some people only care because it's written on a piece of paper. But once enough people don't, they don't matter. I know you mean it in abstract way when you say that it gives power, but many people seem to forget that it's just a piece of paper. If you believe in something because it was constitutional, you're saying imo \"I have no other reason than that I like it that way for personal reasons\". For gun laws that certainly holds true for many people. I don't know what channels you have to go through legally to change your (the U.S.) constitution. It's not impossible is it? At least appending is?\n\n&gt; It only goes in one direction. Especially when it comes to gun rights, once you cross a certain threshold there is no going back, people are stupid and easily scared so they can be browbeaten into thinking guns are evil and scary like in the movies and lack of real experience means they will never change their mind. As guns become irrationally harder to procure the number of people with real experience shrinks dramatically as the older generations die off.\n\n&gt; (Ratchet effect)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet_effect]\n\nSo there are subjective reasons you believe that? I was wondering. The wiki talks about a lot of other things. There is no real ratchet effect in law making, other than that laws are going in a certain direction just as the world is going in a certain direction. The world is ever changing and the idea of a ratchet effect seems a lot like subjective evidence (is that the right word). Is that word used a lot (Ratchet effect)? Rights can be lost and given. If more rights are lost than given, there can be an abundance of reasons (chance for example), but mostly because laws are unspecific and people use loopholes or new things develop and laws have to adapt.\n\n&gt; And yeah: \"modifying\" right is removing them. The only people who talk of \"modifying\" rights are people who want to strip them away. Remember, we're not removing your right to free speech, we're just modifying it so everyone can feel safe: no bad language, nothing that can make people upset, nothing counter-cultural, and naturally no criticisms of the government.\n\nRights are strengthened too. I won't name any examples because I'm on my phone and I don't really know too much about legal decisions in the US and you wouldn't be interested in German decisions.\n\n&gt; Sure, so why isn't her right to own the tools she needs to survive withheld from her out of fear that they might, possibly, and statistically unlikely, hurt someone else?\n\nBecause, and that is my reason I don't want guns in untrained (and even hobby-like trained) hands around me, because she can use that gun to very easily kill me, without even wanting to. Yes, there are other ways I could die without someone wanting me to. But I'm trying to minimize that while still living a normal life. You are talking how it is statistically unlikely she will, it is just as statistically unlikely someone else will want to hurt her and that she can use that weapon to stop him, if not even more unlikely. The balance is very slightly tipped in favor of the mother being allowed to kill her own child to save her own life. In the same way it is tipped against just anyone being allowed to carry a gun. I think all this debate comes from people that like the power and/or need to feel some mostly false sense of security. My uncle once moved from a very nice house to one not so nice because his neighbor had a pit-bull. While I can understand why he is afraid, the fear is irrational and it cost him a lot. The same goes for gun rights in my opinion. It basically boils down to this: \"I understand your fear. I just think it is irrational and not helping. The same way I understand my own fear of guns around me and know it is irrational and not helping.\"\n\nEdit: Had a bug with my phone. So I couldn't continue writing.

Laws derive their power from the ability of their creator and executors to point to where they are entrusted with the power to create and enforce such laws.\n\nAgain, the constitution is just a piece of paper. It holds no power. It has no consciousness. There are no absolutes in lawmaking. Texts get reinterpreted, changed, and destroyed. Just because I write on a document: \"This can never be changed and is true for everybody.\" and 12(?) people sign it, doesn't mean that it is. It's true because it isn't too great an inconvenience for most people. Even if you sign to it, contracts get breached all the time. If both sides don't care than there are no consequences. It is true that some people only care because it's written on a piece of paper. But once enough people don't, they don't matter. I know you mean it in abstract way when you say that it gives power, but many people seem to forget that it's just a piece of paper. If you believe in something because it was constitutional, you're saying imo \"I have no other reason than that I like it that way for personal reasons\". For gun laws that certainly holds true for many people. I don't know what channels you have to go through legally to change your (the U.S.) constitution. It's not impossible is it? At least appending is?\n\n&gt; It only goes in one direction. Especially when it comes to gun rights, once you cross a certain threshold there is no going back, people are stupid and easily scared so they can be browbeaten into thinking guns are evil and scary like in the movies and lack of real experience means they will never change their mind. As guns become irrationally harder to procure the number of people with real experience shrinks dramatically as the older generations die off.\n\n&gt; (Ratchet effect)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet_effect]\n\nSo there are subjective reasons you believe that? I was wondering. The wiki talks about a lot of other things. There is no real ratchet effect in law making, other than that laws are going in a certain direction just as the world is going in a certain direction. The world is ever changing and the idea of a ratchet effect seems a lot like subjective evidence (is that the right word). Is that word used a lot (Ratchet effect)? Rights can be lost and given. If more rights are lost than given, there can be an abundance of reasons (chance for example), but mostly because laws are unspecific and people use loopholes or new things develop and laws have to adapt.\n\n&gt; And yeah: \"modifying\" right is removing them. The only people who talk of \"modifying\" rights are people who want to strip them away. Remember, we're not removing your right to free speech, we're just modifying it so everyone can feel safe: no bad language, nothing that can make people upset, nothing counter-cultural, and naturally no criticisms of the government.\n\nRights are strengthened too. I won't name any examples because I'm on my phone and I don't really know too much about legal decisions in the US and you wouldn't be interested in German decisions.\n\n&gt; Sure, so why isn't her right to own the tools she needs to survive withheld from her out of fear that they might, possibly, and statistically unlikely, hurt someone else?\n\nBecause, and that is my reason I don't want guns in untrained (and even hobby-like trained) hands around me, because she can use that gun to very easily kill me, without even wanting to. Yes, there are other ways I could die without someone wanting me to. But I'm trying to minimize that while still living a normal life. You are talking how it is statistically unlikely she will, it is just as statistically unlikely someone else will want to hurt her and that she can use that weapon to stop him, if not even more unlikely. The balance is very slightly tipped in favor of the mother being allowed to kill her own child to save her own life. In the same way it is tipped against just anyone being allowed to carry a gun. I think all this debate comes from people that like the power and/or need to feel some mostly false sense of security. My uncle once moved from a very nice house to one not so nice because his neighbor had a pit-bull. While I can understand why he is afraid, the fear is irrational and it cost him a lot. The same goes for gun rights in my opinion. It basically boils down to this: \"I understand your fear. I just think it is irrational and not helping. The same way I understand my own fear of guns around me and know it is irrational and not helping.\"\n\nEdit: Had a bug with my phone. So I couldn't continue writing.

The deadliest killings in US history typically involve arson.\n\n&gt;If you limit peoples' ability to own such weapons, you limit the chances such killing sprees will occur\n\nDOJ statistics show that the 10 year ban of the original AWB there was no net attributable effect on mass shooting or the overall murder rate.\n\nDo you think those kinderg\u00e4rtners had a better chance of tackling and stopping  the shooter if he used smaller magazines that had to be swapped out more often?\n\nNever mind that deaths from \"assault weapons\" are among the lowest of any weapon used including unarmed attacks, never mind the entire purpose of the 2nd amendment, never mind that the ban will accomplish nothing to stop spree shooters and we know this from the data on current spree shooters and past attempts at legislation here and around the world, \n\n&gt;Here's the main reasoning: Possessing an [object] is a precondition for murdering somebody with one. Possessing a [scary words that mean nothing] is a precondition for a large-scale killing spree. If you limit peoples' ability to own such cars, you limit the chances such killing sprees will occur. Seems pretty simple to me.\n\nWe should ban every car that drives over 20 mph and weighs more then 500 pounds (kills more people then guns including suicide per year), ban any sort of accelerant that can be used for fire (arson kills hundreds per year and causes billions in damages), ban free speech over 140 characters (free speech is a cause of suicide, genocide, and murder) and submit ourselves to the Democrats who surely do not want to ban all guns or get as close to it as possible, I mean the fact that gun control is highly popular among democratic representatives, that democratic mayors and governors have put forth and sometimes passed on democratic votes extensive gun control, that Sen. Feinstein said that if she could ban every gun if she could get the votes if she could...\n\n&gt;[A]ssault weapons are quickly becoming the leading topic of America's gun control debate and will most likely remain the leading gun control issue for the near future. Such a shift will not only damage America's gun lobby, but strengthen the handgun restriction lobby for the following reasons:\n\n&gt;It will be a new topic in what has become to the press and public an \"old\" debate.\n\n&gt;Although handguns claim more than 20,000 lives a year, the issue of handgun restriction consistently remains a non-issue with the vast majority of legislators, the press, and public. The reasons for this vary: the power of the gun lobby; the tendency of both sides of the issue to resort to sloganeering and pre-packaged arguments when discussing the issue; the fact that until an individual is affected by handgun violence he or she is unlikely to work for handgun restrictions; the view that handgun violence is an \"unsolvable\" problem; the inability of the handgun restriction movement to organize itself into an effective electoral threat; and the fact that until someone famous is shot, or something truly horrible happens, handgun restriction is simply not viewed as a priority. Assault weapons \u2014 just like armor-piercing bullets, machine guns, and plastic firearms \u2014 are a new topic. The weapons' menacing looks, coupled with the public's confusion over fully automatic machine guns versus semi-automatic assault weapons \u2014 anything that looks like a machine gun is assumed to be a machine gun \u2014 can only increase the chance of public support for restrictions on these weapons.
