That's just a band-aid on a much larger issue I fear is coming up - how does society deal with a large swath of its population that is essentially unemployeable?\n\n&gt;Society **as a whole** looking out for itself is such an intrusion on personal freedom, isn't it?\n\nCould that same claim not be made for abortion?  Society, as a whole, has decided that it should mandate everyone buy insurance, participate in a retirement system... and not kill unborn children.  Its simply the elevation of the current belief onto the person, whether they agree with it or not.\n\nOr, to turn it around - I think I don't need insurance and I'm willing to take the risk.  Society says \"We know better than you\" and removes my freedom to take that risk.  The \"We know better than you\" is simply a placeholder for whatever issue we're talking about - and it can easily fall into abortion, drug prohibition, etc.", "id": "t1_ce35slk", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "AuditorTux", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Since you seem to find it such a trial to live in a society that actually includes other people, **most** of whom try to cooperate for the benefit of all, perhaps you should consider moving to a bunker in the desert.", "id": "t1_ce379oy", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "emkay99", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;most of whom try to cooperate for the benefit of all\n\nDepends on what you consider \"cooperating\".

Now, whether they support them when actually proposed is another issue.\n\nThe reason your statement could at least possibly true is that most people think that the way they live their lives is going to benefit society (with literally sociopaths being the only people who don't care or actively go against that).  Ask a deep, red-state conservative if they think opposing abortion, pushing harsher criminal penalties and only providing a spare amount of welfare is for the betterment of society, they'll say yes.  Ask a deep, blue-state liberal if they think allowing abortion-on-demand, drug legalization and a deep, wide safety need is for the betterment of society, they'll say yes.\n\nFunny, though.

A major selling point of the Senate is to allow for democracy among the states as well as among their people. We have a massive country with states that have all sorts of unique needs and interests that need to be balanced against each other. As an example, California may see benefits from tightening restrictions on tobacco sales because of improved citizen health and (in the event of taxes) additional state revenue, but Virginia would be harmed by those same restrictions because it is one of the nation's largest tobacco producers. If you pitted the two states against each other in a purely populist contest, California would win out just because it has more people and would be allowed to freely leverage the federal government to their own benefit in spite of any harm that might do to Virginia. This is a major violation of state sovereignty that the House of Representatives cannot truly address. State sovereignty is important because, as I stated earlier, the country is very large and what makes sense for one part of it doesn't necessarily make sense for another part of it. Allowing states to function on their own makes it easier to address those unique regional needs.
