If I buy American networking equipment, it should give me confidence that it's more secure than a foreign one, not less. Obama's own review board recommended they [Do not \u201csubvert, undermine, weaken or make vulnerable generally available commercial encryption\u201d or standards](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/01/17/us/nsa-changes-graphic.html?_r=0), but Obama ignored this request.\n * There needs to be a way for FISC decisions to be contested in court - the agency and executive should not be able to shield themselves from all oversight with claims of \"national security\".\n * There needs to be evaluation and re-evaluation of targets by an independent body, with the ability to dis-incentivize mis-targeting.\n * There need to be cost-benefit analyses on all of these decisions: clearly no consideration was made of the economic fallout of the inevitable discovery of these programs.\n * It needs to be somehow independently verifiable that, through access controls, a person is physically unable to obtain information on individuals not targeted by a warrant, and circumventing this should carry punishment. \"LOVEINT\" shouldn't have even been possible.\n * Target determination and spying need to be explicitly separated; At the very least, the directors of the NSA and Cybercom should not be the same person. A person who decides to target an individual should not be able to read their communications.\n\n&gt; **... is this to do away with the FBI's ability to label movements and organizations as \"terrorists\" simply because they misused the power? No, we should do away with the lenient rules on what classifies a terrorist**\n\nAgreed - \"terrorist\" has become the new \"communist\". A key part of this is that both the NSA and the FBI have been able to define terms like \"terrorist\", \"target\", and \"collect\" incredibly broadly in their legal basis for these programs/actions, and shield them from criticism by declaring them state secrets. This clearly needs to stop, but I'm not familiar enough with law to make a good assertion as to how. On the other hand, this kind of thing really should have been stopped by some sort of target vetting/verification process.\n\n&gt; **As a further question: can you cite any sources actually claiming the NSA has indeed used its powers to the scope of your fears, or are your fears primarily due to the history of the subject?**\n\n * Subversion of security: [Dual EC PRNG backdoor, RSA Bribe](http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/20/5231006/nsa-paid-10-million-for-a-back-door-into-rsa-encryption-according-to), list of vulnerabilities from Appelbaum's 30C3 talk. I can't emphasize enough how significant this is - this is indiscriminately hurting everyone, everywhere.\n * Scope of programs: On the sidebar [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_641A), as well as in Appelbaum's talk, leaked power point slides, news articles, etc. The scope alone is pretty incriminating, particularly for, e.g., exploits that would mostly affect domestic businesses.\n * [Drone strike targeting](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/02/10/the-nsas-secret-role/)\n * [Use against spouses and love interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOVEINT) - numbers are of self reported abuses, and only for a few locations.\n * Use against domestic politicians: [Russ Tice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russ_Tice), a former NSA employee, has claimed he tapped Obama and members of the Supreme court\n * Not the NSA, but the FBI [put the wrong person on a watch list, and fought it for years](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2014/02/no-fly-list-bungle/)\n * Use in courts: Parallel construction link above\n * Harassment of Cryptographers: Citations in Wikipedia articles linked above. There's no concrete evidence that this is directly linked to the NSA, as opposed to the FBI or just bad policy, but I think it's a significant point regardless - that right now law enforcement is actively harassing civilians that it has asymmetrically decided are its opponents.\n\nAt this point in time, information on other specific uses is protected by State Secret Privelage, so unless it's been leaked, it's not available. Does that mean it's not there? It might, it might not - the evidence isn't enough to prosecute someone, but I would assert that it's damning enough to merit an investigation headed by someone other than James Clapper (who lied to Congress to protect the program). Evidence one way or the other will likely come out in published responses to FOIA requests, future leaks, or lawsuits by the EFF or ACLU, but these will all probably take months to years to pan out. Beyond that, much of the concern stems from how similar programs have been used in the past, but again, these things all happened here, mostly somewhat recently, so I'd advise against dismissing them as too unlikely. I've tried to keep pure conjecture mostly to a minimum.

You referenced the FBI declaring Occupy Wall Street a \"terrorist threat\" -- most would agree that the Occupy Wall Street movement, while childish and unfocused, was *not* a terrorist action --, but is this to do away with the FBI's ability to label movements and organizations as \"terrorists\" simply because they misused the power? No, we should do away with the lenient rules on what classifies a terrorist (Patriot Act, anyone?).   \n  \n____________________________________________________________________________________________  \nI may seem to ramble here in an untie-able knot of analogy, but bear with me, I am going somewhere with it.   \n  \nWhat did our founding fathers do when they looked at government and saw its enormous powers and easily corruptible positions? They pitted the government against itself by the bounds and chains of the Constitution. As you know, we framed our government with Checks and Balances. We noticed patterns in history where the Monarch (analogous to our executive branch) would become tyrannical, the Parliament (Legislative) and Judiciary would step outside of their intended bounds and rights, or the Tyranny of the Majority (the people; probably the worst of the 3 forms of \"branch\" corruption) would destroy the rights of the minority. Our system of pitting these three powerful sections of government against each other like 3 hungry dogs bounded to each other by the same triangular chain, with each trying pull away from the middle, has been one of the most successful methods of structuring government; We may be a young *country*, but our *government* has stood the test of time by being one of the oldest ongoing governments without major changes being made.   \n  \nSo I must ask: when dealing with organizations with such great power as the NSA -- and even the FBI or CIA -- why do we not create such a system? **A \"mini-constitution\" to bound the specific organization to play by the rules?** Why do away with the NSA? **Why not reform it into something that can only act how we wish it to?**   \n  \nOur system of government is slow because of these bounds, so would applying the same system to individual organizations further impair the speed of the organization to a point where it is nearly useless?    \n  \n____________________________________________________________________________________________  \n  \nAs a further question: can you cite any sources actually providing clear data that the NSA has indeed used its powers to the scope of your fears, or are your fears primarily due to the history of the subject and what *could* become?", "edited": 1392162518, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cfcz0wj", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1392161996", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "T-R", "id": "t1_cfcun5v", "parent_id": "t1_cfclj2c", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1432354384, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'd agree that the idea of it being used by one political candidate against another may not be too likely ([though it has happened in recent US history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal)), but [historically, programs like these have been used to harass people who have done nothing illegal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cointelpro#Illegal_surveillance). Things I'm more concerned about than the above example:\n\n * It can be used **against journalists, to reveal sources**, or for extortion, or just to harass them, particularly against those critical of the government. This is really all that's necessary to effectively kill democracy, as it eliminates freedom of the press. No one has to be doing anything illegal.\n * It can be used against those who **are** actually looking to secure our infrastructure, either as harassment, or to undermine the security technology itself. This is done both because of the inaccurate assumption that security is primarily done to protect criminals or exploit vulnerabilities, rather than fix them, as well as because security diminishes intelligence agencies' ability to do this type of surveillance. [In the 90's, Joe Biden pushed to make encryption illegal](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-10024163-38.html); of course, that was a different time - I'm sure he didn't intend to make it illegal to secure his bank account. Still, **The TSA is regularly used to harass cryptographers** such as [the creators of CryptoCat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocat) (secure chat) and [Moxie Marlinspike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxie_Marlinspike). Neither is doing anything that should be considered illegal.\n * When J. Edgar Hoover was in power, spying was used by Hoover himself against *his own* opponents - he could pressure politicians for funding, silence critics by tying them up in investigations, and just generally had the power to warp politics as he saw fit. **He created the [COINTELPRO program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_edgar_hoover#COINTELPRO), first to attack suspected communists \"to ensure financial and public support for the FBI\", and later against others such as Martin Luther King**. This is against free speech/freedom of assembly/freedom of association, but it happened, and no one was prosecuted for it. This is the reason there is now a 10-year limit on the position of FBI Director, and **this is effectively the position Keith Alexander is in today**, as head of both the NSA and CyberCom, but without said term limits.\n * Like COINTELPRO, It could be used to suppress political movements - there's already evidence that the [FBI labelled the Occupy Wallstreet Movement a \"terrorist threat\"](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/29/fbi-coordinated-crackdown-occupy) to justify surveillance against it. Anyone within 3 degrees of separation from a \"non US citizen\" involved in the protests is a legitimate target for direct NSA surveillance. That's likely the whole movement, but anyone who doesn't fit that can be indirectly targeted via information sharing with GCHQ.\n * It can be used for inaccurate automatic targeting, whether for military attacks, SWAT raids, or automatic prosecution of minor crimes. [It's already being used for drone strike targeting] (https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/02/10/the-nsas-secret-role/), and may be responsible for the program's tendency to kill groups of civilians. In some places, **picking up a lost cellphone could get you killed.**\n * It could be used to disproportionately weigh evidence in favor of the government in court cases. [It's already being used for this - it's called 'parallel construction'](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/08/dea-and-nsa-team-intelligence-laundering). A disproportionately strong case by one side can create an illusion of greater guilt than there is, and disable a defense team. It's easy to think about this just being used against drug lords, but what about against someone like Aaron Swartz (who was making a political statement that tax funded university research should be freely available to taxpayers, not locked up and sold by private for-profit \"academic journals\"). What about Supreme Court cases?\n * It can be used by industries against those they oppose. This already happens with other law enforcement agencies: [TransCanada encourages police to prosecute protesters as terrorists](http://www.eenews.net/stories/1059982632), and [Customs has effectively become an enforcement arm of the RIAA and MPAA](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110622/09371114804/mpaa-directly-lobbies-law-enforcement-to-be-its-own-private-police-force.shtml) against those who disagree with the copyright laws they lobbied for. The NSA's data would make targeting these individuals at scale dramatically easier and more effective.\n * It could be used for \"fishing expeditions\" - part of why our legal system works as well as it does is because there's some inherent discretion in application of the law stemming from the fact that it's somewhat harder to prosecute those who commit minor crimes where damage is minimal. A dragnet surveillance system changes this: what if everyone was ticketed for going 1mph over the speed limit? *What if you could be prosecuted for minor violations of the iTunes terms of service? Better go back and read them.* **What if you make an off-color joke that gets perceived as a threat in a private e-mail? Would you like to explain yourself to the FBI?** At the very least, it would take a long time for laws to catch up with the concept that they can be universally, unquestioningly, indiscriminately enforced.\n * It can be used for corporate espionage - it appears that it already is. As Jacob Appelbaum mentions in his 30C3 presentation, \"[how many terrorists do you think are using Solaris?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0w36GAyZIA)\". Indeed, how many are using the Dual Elliptic Curve encryption that the NSA compromised and deceived NIST into recommending? The most likely users are domestic businesses. As an example, the information the NSA has would be tremendously useful for insider trading, either by NSA employees themselves, or by anyone in the banking industry that would be willing to pay them for it.\n * I haven't mentioned it elsewhere, as it's somewhat tangential, but the NSA has a program that allows them to completely censor communication. From Appelbaum's talk: \"So if the NSA wanted to tomorrow, they could kill every anonymity system that exists by just forcing everyone who connects to an anonymity system to reset just the same way that the Chinese do right now [...] So that\u2019s like the NSA builds the equivalent of the Great Firewall of Earth.\"\n\nI could list more, but I think you get the point - it can be used to extract profit, to eliminate criticism of the government, or even just indiscriminately against neutral individuals. Some require corruption, some just require good intentions, like the UK's new \"porn filter\". The point I want to make clear, though, is that I've mostly avoided discussing hypothetical situations: **these are all firmly grounded in things that have happened in recent history *in the US*, or things that are happening right now**, and I've stuck mostly to well-known, reputable sources to drive that point home.\n\nThe issue isn't whether or not anyone in the NSA seems corrupt right now, or whether the FBI would be equally capable (it very well may be). No agency should be allowed to have such far reaching capabilities, and **for whatever capabilities we give them, there need to be clear deterrents against misuse, and active checks for compliance**. Otherwise, the law effectively doesn't apply to them, and we're just waiting for someone to take advantage of it. And if they can hide everything by claiming it's a state secret for \"national security\", we may never get enough evidence to bring them to court.\n\n**Even if there's no corruption in the system, I, as a software engineer, shouldn't have to be afraid that studying how to keep my site's users secure, or making posts like this one, will cause me to be a target for TSA harassment, and worry about even the possibility that I'd have to explain my browser history to some non-technical law enforcement officer. That's not a democracy.**\n\nI apologize for my verbosity, but I do suggest checking out any of the links that strike you as interesting. Particularly the Wikipedia articles on [J. Edgar Hoover](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_edgar_hoover) and [COINTELPRO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cointelpro), and, if you can overlook some technical jargon, [Jacob Appelbaum's 30C3 presentation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0w36GAyZIA) - they're all positively terrifying.", "edited": 1392162003, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1xjeue", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cfcun5v", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1392152566", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "TheDewyDecimal", "id": "t1_cfclj2c", "parent_id": "t1_cfchmxf", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1432350027, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; Now onto what if Snowden had been connected to say a drug cartel in Mexico and gave all your financial information over to them.

The only thing I can think of - and you mentioned this - is that this could be used in partisan politics to destroy the character of an opponent.

The problem came in with globalization.  Once too much of the labor playing field was outside of their control, they held on too long to policies that left business unable to compete and in the end may have lost the jobs they were protecting because of it.  It is not an endemic issue, but there are also cases where people that clearly should be fired are not.  With respect to government unions, my opinion is that most of the more aggravating aspects of dealing with government stem from practices pushed by unions to save jobs that are obsolete.  To phase it another way, the government union is why we can't have a nice easy online experience with most agencies.  I think unions should exist as a check and balance to executives and management.

From various articles that I have read, the decline in participation is increasing the number of activists running in elections.  By activist I mean someone with a strong stance on some issues, but not necessarily all issues.  I think this is what is driving the increase in independents.  I lean to the right and currently live in Massachusetts which is pretty liberal.  So here I tend to vote for the republican.  I last lived in South Carolina, which is pretty far to the right.  There I voted democrat since I disagreed with many of the stances of SC Republicans.\n\nMy basic opinion is that thanks to the Two Santa Claus theory, the two parties are currently dividing along rural and urban lines.  An example is how in the Farm Bill the GOP is defending crop insurance, a rural spending priority, and cutting SNAP, affects both areas and while I am not certain of this I believe that benefits urban areas more.  Where does that leave the suburbs which get high turnout?  My guess is this is where you are getting the fastest increase in independents.\n\nAre they becoming less ideological?  Yes, I think I agree.  We saw a Republican president that passed an expansion to Medicare and now have a Democrat that made a large swath of tax cuts permanent.  To me this is each side doing things normally attributed to the other in an attempt to poach more support from the other side.  If you listen to the talk, you would believe the opposite.

The short summary is that the \"drunken sailor\" spending spree of the GOP under Bush was not an aberration, but a side effect of years of both parties trying to send as much money to their districts as possible.  The urban/rural divide has been the natural boundary where most policies diverge.\n\nIf you have lived in both an urban and a rural area, you will be well aware that each has problem unique to it.  So what we are seeing is not more \"conservative\" candidates coming out.  We are seeing more candidates that are unwilling to fund policies that they don't believe benefit their \"side\" of the divide.  The farm bill was a perfect example.\n\nFrom the perspective of many conservative voters, there is no party of fiscal responsibility.  They saw the massive buildup in government spending even when their party was in charge.  So they are apt to accept people that talk much tougher, place the blame on those who work with liberals instead of seeing that their own party has become quite liberal in how it spends, yet get nothing from those tough new politicians when those folks get to DC and realize that actually cutting spending would impact their districts and not in a good way.  All this and they are completely boxed into a corner on revenue as a way to decrease the deficit.\n\n**tl;dr;**  The problem is the GOP itself.  The party has lost its fiscal conservative credentials and is now just the party of liberals that like their big government with a big side of guns and ammo.  The US can no longer afford two Santas and the increased polarization is over whose Santa is going to get less this year to give out.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "If you really think about it, corporate profits are a tax on consumers that is redistributed to the owners of capital, i.e. the wealthy.  It acts pretty much the same way.  People generally accept this because we have seen a vast increase in quality of living for most of the time capitalism has been the dominate force.  History has examples of similar disparities and the resultant economy was, like today, much more prone to cycles of boom and bust.\n\nIf you want to think another way, the wealthy have a higher proclivity to save when they have an increase in income while the poor are more likely to spend.  The spending of the poor feeds into the wealth of the rich and some of that comes back to the poor in the form of wages or transfer payments.  Wages are obviously the better source since it generally implies that the poor are adding their contribution to production.\n\nWhen there is high profitability, that cycle has a sink at the top which causes more and more wealth to concentrate.  Eventually as this cycle gets out of balance, the rich run out of productive investments and we see more speculative bubbles as investors crowd out producers for traded resources.  Prices go up because of higher costs of materials and this increases the already downward pressure on wages to maintain profitability.  The poor have a more and more difficult time keeping up with inflation that is driven by increases in commodity costs or increased profit margins as in most cases they don't share in any part of that steam of income.  As more and more people slip from being able to maintain an acceptable standard of living, civic unrest will start to formant and  can eventually lead to increases in crime.  This can cause quality of life for many to deteriorate even further as physical insecurity is added to economic insecurity.  On the other side, profit margins stagnate because demand is dampened by a lack of capital.  This can cause producers to cut labor share even further which in turn will lead to decreased purchasing power for those that lose their jobs.  As a society we have been able to defer this a bit by increasing access to credit and via transfer payments via taxation, but this is only a temporary fix as eventually servicing the debt deteriorates cash flow for the poor even more creating a downward spiral of increased debt leading to deteriorating cash flow and repeat.  Transfer payments are a whole different discussion I'll avoid here.\n\nGrowth is therefore a key to the whole cycle above that allows the capital class to extract wealth from the productive classes.  As long as it is sufficient to maintain the income flow to the masses everything can continue to work as it does.  Once that share begins to decline, their behavior becomes more unpredictable.\n\nI'd argue many economists don't have a substantial grasp of the societal forces which underlie the equations they hold so dear.  Like all science, there are axioms upon which most of the rest of economics rest on.  When consumers are no longer rational, ideal systems fall apart.  Like an electrical system, certain types of feedback can cause massive instability and unpleasant outcomes.\n\n**tl;dr;**  Where money flows is just as important as how much capital stock there is.  When too much in controlled by too few, the basic axioms of economics no longer hold as much sway and the resulting economic instability can and often does increase social instability.", "id": "t1_cdv281m", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "mtwestbr", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cduxgx0", "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1428368079, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1s8914", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdv281m", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386343763", "ups": 4, "distinguished": null}

Nothing about Reagan forced businesses to cap every bit of labor cost *except* the executives.  That is a conscious decision that each business makes to vastly overemphasizes the importance of executives while minimizing the contributions of the rest of the organization.\n\nGlobalization is a big factor because it vastly increases the labor pool and basic supply demand explains how that will depress wages.  On the positive side, this has helped a lot of people around the world exit poverty.  On the negative side it increases competition for businesses and this competition feeds into a race to the bottom on cost.  You can have the best product in the world, but if you cannot make profit selling it why build it.  This is also generally where the tax argument comes into play as well.  Again it is a race to the bottom to minimizes costs.\n\nI tend to think we are at the end of this cycle of thinking.  It should be very obvious that the free market is anything but free.

You pay them, they provide fire protection services, just like Geico does for car insurance. you don't pay them, you don't get any services.

Step 2 would be arguing that not everyone really needs them and that it's too costly to give it to everyone. step 3. is to turn it into a subscription-based model.\n\nyou see this same sort of idea with charter schools.

That's just here in CT tho, because i'm damned sure the idea that ambulance services are a \"public good\" isn't going away any time soon.  \n\nnow, in Tennessee, that's a different story.", "id": "t1_cdcohif", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;That's just here in CT tho, because i'm damned sure the idea that ambulance services are a \"public good\" isn't going away any time soon.\n\n&gt;now, in Tennessee, that's a different story.\n\nSo are you saying that those living in Obion County (but not in the city) shouldn't be allowed to make their own decisions?  I guess you, sitting in CT, know more about what they really need than they do.  Am I right?\n\n&gt;you see this same sort of idea with charter schools. People want to untangle the idea of \"public education\" and eliminate the \"public\" part. \n\nCharter schools are not the privatization of education - they are more akin to the ambulance analogy.  A group comes in and says that they can get better results while still costing less than if the school district ran it themselves.  In other cases, they aren't even run by another group, but rather focusing on a few subjects such as math or art (we call these magnet schools).  You're thinking of a voucher program.\n\n&gt;Others believe we're a nation, and we rise and fall as one.\n\nExcept we're not rising and falling as one.  We're rising and falling as a division of a down defined by the school board on student population and teacher requirements.  Its not like someone living in Dallas can decide to transfer to a school in Richardson.  They are locked into the district in which they live... and many times can't even transfer within that district.  So what happens when that assigned school is failing?  Those living up in CT aren't impacted, nor are those with the resources to pull their kids from that school and put them into a private school.  So what do we do with those kids?  Sacrifice them on the alter of some sort of \"national unity\"?\n\nIt sounds great in high-level lines, but real people are impacted by this.  And I don't mind so much if people are impacted by their own decisions, foolish or not (such as those in a county that decide not to get fire protection) but when someone on high makes a decision that impacts someone negatively (or leaves them there ignored) that's when I get pissed off.", "id": "t1_cdcov31", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "AuditorTux", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1qe3vy", "selftext": "Well we can't let people just \"decide for themselves\" certain things without the assurances we'll get results we as a nation would be ok with.

Spending has been pretty consistent at 3.5 trillion per year since then which is 20% above the Bush years and mainly a result of increased spending due to the recession.\n\nOn the flip side, revenue in 2000 was about [2 trillion](http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/fed_revenue_2000USrn), to 2.5 trillion in [2008](http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/fed_revenue_2008USrn) which in no way kept pace with the rate of spending mainly due to the tax cuts strongly supported by the GOP and that 2.5 trillion number has been steady into 2012.\n\nSo the obvious glaring problem here is on the spending side, but what the GOP fails to mention is that the vast majority of those spending increases came under their watch.

There are two parties that want significant changes and neither has quite enough support to push their agendas.  As support I'll note the period of 2000-2006 when we had a 100% GOP controlled government.  Two wars, tax cuts, DHS creating a second big government within an already big government, a huge, unpaid for expansion of Medicare, and deregulation mixed with defunding of institutions and regulations that protected the America economy for 60 years.  Fast forward to 2008-2010 and you have the democrats with the same scenario of holding all three branches.  The democrats got the ACA.  Folks can go on about what a watered down POS it was thanks to lobbying and giveaways to major players in Big Med, but it is a significant change.  Thanks to the Franken delay they did not get much time to implement other ideas, but they were certainly trying to swing back on many of the changes from the previous GOP run.\n\nWhat I see is a government mired by special interests all trying to increase their piece of American Pie.  The big players seem to want to make their special status protected and are all trying to generate big profits via legislation.  Be it Military Contractors, Insurance companies, Big Banks, etc; it does not matter.  They all want a guaranteed income without taking risks.  This is the radical change in the good old USA that the two parties are both accomplices in.

No, there are plenty of folks that detest what is happening in our political parties.  Sadly they are drowned out by the voices parroting the desires of the .01%.

Forget whether or not you believe in it for a second and just think of the consequences of a few degrees rise in global temperature.  It will be a disaster on a scale that no one has ever seen.  Massive crop failures, droughts on a scale that would make the Dust Bowl seem tame, storms that tear apart entire nations, sea level rises that take out lots of land that is currently heavily inhabited, and I'm sure plenty of other issues.  Food and water scarcity will force leaders to either tear what is left apart with conflict leading to a long and painful dark age or to come together as we never have before to meet the challenge.\n\nI see the pros as primarily economic, as the current race to the bottom that dominates global commodity manufacturing is no longer possible and we start to see a new paradigm based on humanism that seeks to lift up advanced nations to whatever heights they are capable while also lifting up others that have been behind.  I would expect it would be a federalist system that grants the old nation states wide powers while allowing for easier migration of people between states such that we could have a diverse collection of social paradigms with freedom of individuals to migrate to those they wish to far more easily than now.  It would continually evolve and hopefully have leaders wise enough not to sink back into the us vs them mentality that dominates global thinking.\n\nThe biggest con I see is that it will be very, very difficult to get there.  Many will be suspicious that it is a power grab by some version of an Illuminati or NWO type conspiracy.  For those in the US think the far right and their \"Obama is bringing in the UN to take away our freedom\" memes and magnify that by a lot when it actually starts to look possible.  People that crave power rarely like to see it diminished and that is pretty common out there.  The cultural differences will also be a big issue for a while as people with strong views of how people should be will try to force that on people that don't want it.", "id": "t1_cb16c7i", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "mtwestbr", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I like the EU as an example.

He followed ideas present in his Green Book which is more direct democracy than what we currently have in the US. \n\nI know it's wiki but just trying to reply quickly but I can find more credible sites if you want. Nevertheless:\n&gt;[The Green Book rejects modern liberal democracy based on electing representatives as well as capitalism. Instead, it proposes a type of direct democracy overseen by the General People's Committee which allow direct political participation for all adult citizens.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Green_Book_(Libya))\n\nIf you look into wiki of the [Politics of Gaddafi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Libya_under_Muammar_Gaddafi) itself, you will see a lot of good he has done, like:\n&gt;During his rule, Gaddafi took increasing control of the government, but he also attempted to achieve greater popular participation in local government. In 1973, he announced the start of a \"cultural revolution\" in schools, businesses, industries, and public institutions to oversee administration of those organizations in the public interest. The March 1977 establishment of \"people's power\" \u2014with mandatory popular participation in the selection of representatives to the GPC\u2014 was the culmination of this process.\n\nI just gave you wiki since its general ideas about it. Now let's look into actual things happening in Libya and from Gaddafi himself.\n\n[Here is one video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7rfEhtspC8) you should watch to understand what is going on. \n\nYou could also watch plenty of speeches given by Gaddafi that completely supports his ideas present in the Green Book. Especially listen to the one he gave in Tripoli or this [one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKMyY2V0J0Y). \n\nI could give you a mountain of proofs but its all there on youtube as videos, and things like this [list of good things he did to the people of Libya](http://expertscolumn.com/content/list-good-things-muammar-gaddafi-done-people-libya). \n\nSo yeah we just still painted him as terrible leader, when he was far from it. Of course he isn't exactly a saint either but he was definitely not a tyrant. That was just propaganda that we all just took in as the truth. \n\nSo now the question is... why did they target Gaddafi? Why did they want to get rid of him? [My guess is that it has to do with his golden currency](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLJu0X14vmg) which was a direct threat to the US petrodollar. \n\nAlso this is lot like the case with Saddam too but that was more justifiable because he wasn't a good person but then again, considering how problematic the politics there has become, he was probably a great leader for them.

If this was something that Obama was covering up or playing political games with there would be some end goal, some response to the attacks, instead nothing happened (Embassies got more security, but that isn't a political or tactical goal in any way), I think that undermines the entire argument that this was a political move, Obama got nothing out of this strategically or politically why make a cover up of something if you aren't using it or afraid of it. \n\nMiscommunications happen all the time, remember the game of telephone from childhood (tell a sentence down a line of people and see how it changed at the last person) imagine that on a massive scale (thousands of people) with information coming in by the minute with conflicting reports and a massive sense of urgency to be on top of it.

The GOP is forming of history of opposing policies they supported as soon as Obama gets involved.  The individual mandate in the ACA was the first incident I'm aware of.  I think the Obama team picked up on this and has taken every opportunity to paint the GOP as a purely partisan operation that is wildly inconsistent in what policies it supports and why.  If not that they are painted as extreme as in the case you mentioned with the tax cuts where it was all or nothing  negotiations for a very, very long time.\n\nMy thoughts on the gun control issue is that the administration is throwing out test balloons in guns, immigration, and a couple of other areas to see what sticks.  Immigration is another case of proposing things that could get bipartisan support where guns is not.  I think in the guns case they are just putting out bait for the nuts to go and act foolish.  I don't think it is working.  The immigration debate should be much more interesting to watch.\n\nThe overall goal is to hold onto the Senate in 2014 and continue making gains in the house or at least minimize losses.  Obama has two paths here.  Find GOP incumbents that are willing to work with him hoping that the far right will burn resources throwing primary challengers at them.  If Obama fails to get any to work with him he can keep tossing out policies they once supported or that have popular support so he can continue to point at Congress and say they are just playing political gains and fighting against polices that have majority support.

Everything in between is a bit more of a stretch.\n\nNow the issue is that the places where it makes the most sense are generally not very cheap in terms of land.  I'm in Boston and the Boston-NY-DC corridor makes a ton of sense.  The problem is that land use in this corridor is pretty high which creates a number of issues around construction (very expensive), any additional land rights that would be needed (very expensive), and existing traffic.  So we get a not quite high speed rail solution where existing traffic shares rail with slower traffic.\n\nThere are also plenty of air and road options in that corridor, so I think it is mostly a matter that the justification is hard to make for the proposed 150 billion price tag.\n\nFor the opponents, Amtrak is a regular target for the GOP.  So I think saying Big Oil would not be happy to see improved mass transit is a pretty safe bet.  The next big obstacle as I see it is the American preference for cars.  My family is in NY and it would be great to have a mass transit option to see them.  Problem is that they are not in NYC nor near the rail lines on the Hudson river, so getting from a depot to them means I'm getting a car anyway.  That I'm outside Boston metro is another obstacle.  I may not be a completely typical suburban dweller, but enough so that I would guess that having limited \"last mile\" access to public transit out into to surrounding areas is a limiter on potential customers.\n\n**tl;dr**; There is no single obstacle or opponent.

You somehow want to include in their administrative overhead 20% of the cost of complying with the entire tax code, almost all of which has nothing to do with Medicare and FICA taxes (certainly not 20%).  With or without Medicare, those tax compliance costs would exist.  You're applying a political argument to an accounting one.  It's about as intellectually dishonest as it gets.\n\n&gt; so when you leave out lots of the cost, costs are really low? amazing!\n\nWhen you leave out the administrative costs and inefficiencies generated by the private plans in Medicare, and just analyze the public plans, yes, costs get low.  It's almost as this is because the private plans are less efficient.  Gasp!\n\n&gt; um, what? 110 billion out of 800 is about 14%.\n\n1.5-2% overhead is $12-16 billion, plus $60 billion in fraud is $72-76 billion is 9.0-9.5%.  This is the overhead of the public plan (I believe Medicare Part A and maybe B).\n\n&gt; it is as likely that the 60 billion is an underestimate as an overestimate. the senate finance committee[1] says between 20 and 100 billion.\n\nIs that the range that one report found, or the range over a bunch of different reports?  It sounds like the latter, in which cause you cannot assume that represents some confidence interval where $60 billion is the median.  The fact is, from what I've seen, there is little rigor in the analysis behind these numbers, mostly based on assumptions.\n\n*Edit: To point, you claim the range of fraud in Medicare is 20 to 100 billion, while the FBI reported there is only 80 billion in total medical fraud a year.  There's barely any accuracy to these numbers, making any cross report comparisons meaningless (i.e. 60 billion vs 80 billion total).*\n\n&gt; no it isn't. the private companies in medicare advantage still have the burden of collections.\n\nWe've been over this, collections from the IRS are included in Medicare's administrative costs, so it'd still be an accurate comparison.\n\n&gt; Medicare advantage has all the disadvantages of traditional medicare PLUS those of private insurers. no wonder it is inefficient.\n\nIt actually operates fairly identically to the public part of Medicare.  If you'd actually read this [paper](http://institute.ourfuture.org/files/Jacob_Hacker_Public_Plan_Choice.pdf) I keep citing:\n\n&gt; However, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has \nfound that administrative costs under the public Medicare plan are less than 2 percent of \nexpenditures, compared with approximately 11 percent of spending by private plans under \nMedicare Advantage.16 This is a near perfect \u201capples to apples\u201d comparison of \nadministrative costs, because the public Medicare plan and Medicare Advantage plans are \noperating under similar rules and treating the same population.\n \n&gt; (And even these numbers may unduly favor private plans: A recent General \nAccounting Office report found that in 2006 Medicare Advantage plans spent 83.3 percent \nof their revenue on medical expenses, with 10.1 percent going to non-medical expenses and \n6.6 percent to profits\u2014a 16.7 percent administrative share.)17\n\nThey're as close as a comparisons as you're going to get, and the public plans have around 2% overhead compared to 11-16.7% that private plans have.  \n\n&gt; i made a small mistake in my math. that is all. You, by contrast, continue to deny legal reality because it suits your ideology to do so.\n\nYou have consistently gotten even the most basic of facts wrong, and even when faced with the data to prove you wrong, you just bury your head in the sand.  And the fact that you think a semantic political definition somehow alters reality is mind boggling.\n\nI challenge you this: on actual logical merits, argue for me why tax code compliance costs that are *completely* unrelated to how Medicare operates, should somehow be included in their administrative costs?

The specific cost of fica vs. income taxes is irrelevant, because legally, what source the income is from is irrelevant.\n\nWe're talking accounting, and you're trying to use a *legal* argument to back your case?  Just laughable.  Somehow the fact that the US tax code is riddled with exemptions and loopholes requiring higher compliance costs is somehow supposed to be counted towards Medicare overhead?  Please.  If you were being intellectually honest at all you'd see how pathetic this argument is.  Until you can show how much cost tax compliance with FICA is, you don't have an argument.\n\n&gt; medicare/caid's administrative costs are usually cited at 6%. \n\nThose figures that cite 6% either include the private plans in Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D, or were unaware that cost collection from the IRS and other services are included in the original figures, and thus double count when \"recalculating\".  When looking at just the public plans, as reported in the trustees report, you get [closer to around 1.5-2.0%](http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Mcare-admin.jpg).\n\n&gt; then we should count that as part of administrative expenses, not care. so instead of spending 750 billion on healthcare and 50 on admin, they spend 110 billion on admin and spend 690 on healthcare. that's an admin ratio of 16% right there.\n\nAfter all this discussion and you don't even know how administrative costs are calculated? They're done as a percent of total expenditure, as can be seen in almost any graph, article or paper that discusses this issue.  It was even directly laid out in the heritage article you posted, do you not read your own sources?\n\nFixing these two glaringly inaccurate parts, you get to around 9.0-9.5% overhead, still less than the 12-17% reported for private insurance.  And this is making the most generous assumptions one can, i.e. that the $60 billion figure is accurate and not an overestimate and that private insurance has $0 fraud.\n\n&gt; then you have to add the cost of tax compliance on top of that. \n\nWhich you've yet to show is a large burden at all, or how it compares with the burden compliance with private insurance costs.  Until you can produce reliable figures citing this, this argument is bunk.\n\n&gt; Of course, then there is the further issue of patient pools. medicare beneficiaries consume much more healthcare than everyone else, because they are old. if you look at admin costs per patient, instead of per healthcare dollar, medicare is worse than private companies.\n\nIf this were true than you'd expect to see the private plans in Medicare have about the same administrative costs, but they don't.  As shown above and repeated often, [Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D have around 11% overhead verses the 2% that the public Medicare plan has](http://institute.ourfuture.org/files/Jacob_Hacker_Public_Plan_Choice.pdf).  This is as apples-to-apples comparison you can get and there is a large difference.\n\nBased on the amount of basic mistakes you're (repeatedly) making, please read up on the area instead of relying on Heritage Foundation for your facts.  [This](http://institute.ourfuture.org/files/Jacob_Hacker_Public_Plan_Choice.pdf) is a decent start for some of the basic facts, and if you really want to get wonky on administrative costs you can check out [this paper](http://jhppl.dukejournals.org/content/early/2013/02/11/03616878-2079523.abstract) (might be gated).

Back then deficits were more under control, tax revenue as a percentage of GDP was much higher, Medicare spending was much lower as a percentage of the economy, the retiree to worker ration was much more manageable, and America was still benefiting from a post WWII golden age.\n\nWhere things went to crap was when Reagan came along and used the funds that the democrats pushed into the general fund to obfuscate the revenue situation to lower tax rates.  We managed with trickle down type policy for about 20 years until we got to the Bush 2 years.  Those tax cuts have been a complete waste as they did not create any growth, certainly not in the long term as I don't see much growth today.\n\nSo fast forward to today and the big problem I have with the right is the privatization plans they put forward.  If I could take my money and put in investments myself without going through the fee factory of Wall St, I think it would be something I'm interested in.  More than likely it would look closer to a 401k, which in my opinion are just a convenient way for the big managers of these funds with market maker capabilities to rob the fund flows at every opportunity and that is a big reason why most funds have been pretty stagnant for going on a dozen years.\n\nLast, SS is not the problem; Medicare is.  Part D was written with built in waste to make sure big pharma got a big payout.  The ACA had the same problem in making sure that market forces are stymied to benefit suppliers and insurers.  The problem is clear as day, and it is the costs stupid.  The problem is both parties are owned by the people getting all that sweet government cash and they are not about to let their shills in congress take it away to make the program more efficient.\n\nSo in summary, this is an interesting post in that it clearly points out how the Democratic party is not much better than the Republicans when taking a holistic view of the debt problem.

My understanding is that productivity gains have been rather steady and the number of people required for manufacturing has been steadily decreasing.

There will be fewer workers required and they will need a skill set that can deal with automated manufacturing.  There is also the limiting factor of physical resources needed to make things and that will likely be a limiter on what is made here.\n\nLong term things become a bigger problem.

Go back and look at [Pew's research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_tax_cuts#Debate_over_continuation_of_cuts) - the cost of all the tax cuts would be $3.3 trillion.

From [2009](http://www.ntu.org/tax-basics/who-pays-income-taxes.html) (which is actually low compared to the rest of the source) those making over $150k paid nearly 60% of the burden and those making over $350k paid for nearly 36% of the burden.

Same with local.  Bringing those into the calculation is foolish since we're just talking about *federal* taxes.\n\nLets add in the payroll taxes (FICA, Medicare) and all federal taxes - look, its still [quite progressive - go down to \"Effective Federal Tax Burdens (2009)\"](http://www.justfacts.com/taxes.asp#distribution).  The top 1% still pay 30% of the federal tax burden.  But I argue that payroll taxes themselves should be excluded for this as both FICA and Medicare are funding a system which you will later draw out of (deferred, direct benefit for paying), where federal income taxes are at best attached to nothing directly (current, indirect benefit for paying).  But lets ignore that qualm for now.  They paid 30% of all taxes in 2009.  That's great, but we won't know if its regressive just by that, we also need to know their share of the [income](http://taxfoundation.org/article/summary-latest-federal-individual-income-tax-data-0#table1).  Their share of AGI was 16.9%.  They're paying at roughly a double rate relative to their share of income.\n\nNow, will you find exceptions?  Sure.  I can find them in my own practice.
