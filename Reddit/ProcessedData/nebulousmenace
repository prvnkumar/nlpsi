And the response to workers trying to form a union are frequently a bad thing. Joe Hill getting framed, coal miners getting massacred, Pinkertons hiring out as a private army, etc.\n\nSo what's the downside of unions? Well, they are a monopoly, for one thing, and for another they have been closely tied to organized crime in many cases.

From 1910 to 1940, a sizable portion of rural black community fled the south in search of better paying industrial jobs in northern cities like Detroit. While certainly not met with the same level of racial and abuse they were used to in the south, the migrants were quickly relegated to largely segregated areas of the city, where most new migrants found cheap housing and a support structure. The great depression crippled these neighborhoods far worse than similar white neighborhoods. White employers would rarely choose to hire a black man over a white one, even at a lower wage. \n\nThe onset of WWII changed that. Detroit's industrial complex grew to meet the demands of the defense industry, and quickly outstripped the available workforce. A new, even larger wave of black migrants began to arrive from southern cities, this time urbanized and trained in skilled labor positions, ideal for factory work. The previous black quarters quickly expanded as young men left for the war and more black families entered the city. This round of migrants faced much better working conditions compared to their peers a generation before. The needs of WWII and the prosperous years following the war meant that skilled labor was in high demand, and black workers could make a good middle class living. Black neighborhoods and schools improved, and many black families could afford to open their own businesses, which had until this point been rare. Throughout this period, white soldiers returning from the war were moving out of the city to buy homes in newly constructed suburbs. \n\nOver the next serveral decades, Detroit's car factories began to shut down as manufacturers spread their factories throughout the country to decentralize their production. The black population, which had little to no training in jobs outside factories, no generational buildup of capital, and an extremely predatory and hostile credit environment, was left with few options. The majority of the new generation of black Detroit residents were completely unprepared for a city without manufacturing jobs for them to work in. The upper class white population that historically had laid out capital for large enough business projects to employ thousands of residents had already moved on. Detroit middle class was left to slowly collapse under the weight of it's own success.

Asking for identification is not a roadblock - it has no bearing on how free or democratic an election is. If the law required an IQ test, those who passed it would still vote freely and the candidates would still be elected democratically. By definition, there is no requirement in democracy that all people get to vote or are required to vote. In the US, only citizens who have reached the age of majority are allowed to vote, one time, for their chosen candidate for office in a given election. If voting is that important to a person then they have to be responsible for ensuring that they can in fact vote (financially, documentation-wise, and time-wise.) \n\nThe possession of identification is a functional requirement to daily living. ID is required to open a bank account, register for school, to get a DL, to start a job, to write a check (in some cases.) We issue certificates of birth/naturalization, school records, marriage certificates, court records, and provide facilities for getting replacements of each of those. As someone else mentioned, in most, if not all states, you can obtain a state issued ID (distinct from a DL) at little to no cost. The truth of the matter is that obtaining ID doesn't have to be done around election time, it can be done any time.\n\nPeople need to be responsible for ensuring that they can exercise the rights they are guaranteed. It is not the government's job to both maintain those rights and ensure thhose rights are excercised by the individual. The government is however **required** to discriminate between those who can legally vote and those who cannot.

It depends on how long someone works and how much they made and contributed.  Then it matters how long they draw retirement.  It also matters at what level of return the government can get on our funds.\n\nSo lets set up a little test scenario with Excel and we can see what would happen.  Assume our person starts working for $50k a year and averages a 3% raise over his 40 year career (working 25 to 65).  The contribution rate is 6.2% of his income (it will be slightly less due to deductions, etc, but lets ignore those since this is a round number).  Using those scenarios, assuming no inflation, he would have contributed over $100k into Social Security (and another $100k by his employer).  Now saw he lives to 85, drawing on SS for 20 years.  He would need to draw about $12k to come out ahead, just in nominal dollars.  \n\nThat might be doable.  But usually there is interest rates.  Lets assume that this person would have been able get, say 6% if he had been putting this in a private account.  Instead of $100k in the bank, he has $375k in the bank (and would have another $375k based on his employer contribution).  He would need $36k per year to break even.\n\nYes, Social Security tends to be a bad investment, especially since we're not even talking about interest returns during the withdrawl period.  And you can play with all of those variables.  So if we raise the cap, we help support Social Security.\n\n**TL;DR:** Increasing the cap and the payout would, actually, make SS better off, actually causing the rich to pay far more in than they'd ever get out.", "id": "t1_c7uvlw8", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "AuditorTux", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_16ch25", "id": "t1_c7v15jw", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "legsleeves", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "It will definitely affect employers negatively.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_14mlt3", "selftext": "I generally stay away from global warming arguments because I don't know anyone (on either side) who's ever changed sides, except [this guy](http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-kochfunded-climate-change-skeptic-reverses-course-20120729,0,7372823.story). \n\nI happen to believe that anthropogenic global warming is real, and Something Should Be Done. Now, if I was omnipotent dictator of the US, a job I would do badly, here's what I'd do: \n\n* $0.50/gallon federal gasoline tax, ratcheting up over time to $1.00/gallon (maybe higher.) Regressive, unfortunate, but it does change people's behavior. While I'm at it, your SUV/pickup is either registered commercial or it's required to meet actual car standards for mileage, safety, etc. (See? Give me dictatorial powers and I start making shit up. ) Pain makes people carpool and buy high-mileage cars, known fact.\n\n* Fund several large (&gt;200 MW, 12+ hours of storage), competing technologies for energy storage- ARES, several different types of CAES, whoever the \"ski lift\" guys are - and see what works and how well. In the process, we will end up with 12 GW-hours or more of storage. And we will spend many billions of dollars. And probably throw several billion dollars away on ideas that don't work. \n\n* Keep paying people for solar and wind; any changes in policy have to be enacted five years in advance. In the last five years installed solar's gone up by a factor of 14; another factor of 14 and it might start becoming noticeable. \n\n* Increase the funding for clean energy R&amp;D by a factor of five. What we have now is good, but a lot more money would make it a little better. ARPA-E has a budget under a billion dollars a year (not the only people doing the work, I know.) The Navy, by comparison, had a budget of 161 billion dollars last year. I have specific things I'm rooting for, like polywell fusion, but I don't want to be like the Shah of Iran or Lysenko. (\"You know what's awesome? Hovercraft. Let's buy a lot of them.\") \n\n* Push energy efficiency really, really hard. Everyone agrees that efficiency is good, so nobody gets really passionate about it. And seriously we can save, probably, 30% of energy across the board without a single visible inconvenience. Just by having lights automatically turn off when nobody's in the room and insulating our attics, things like that.\n\n* Set up a big scientific commission to find The Next Vehicle Fuel. (I don't know what, except it's not gonna be hydrogen without four separate miracles.)  Throw a lot of money at whatever decision is made- methanol, natural gas, biodiesel, I don't care. It's like TV- we need a single standard. \n\nIf I was just a regular President, having to convince Congress and abide by the Constitution and stuff like that... I'm not sure what I'd push first.", "id": "t1_c7f676t", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "nebulousmenace", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_14mlt3", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1430648830, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7f676t", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1355280297", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}
