{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Great break down. But I want to pick on you for one of your points and I'd like your thoughts.\n\n&gt; Social democratic systems retain a capitalist framework (so there is private ownership of capital, market-based economic decisions, etc). However, capitalism in social democratic states is tempered by two things. First, there is substantial collective bargaining among the government, management, and strong labor unions to set wages and benefits.\n\nFinally, I like this middle ground here but doesn't this create a dangerous and toxic mix of private interests and public money? Unions are private entities. Corporations are private entities. What results is collectively elected governors being bought out and creating legislation that seems on it's face to benefit the public but whose first benefactors will always be the private corporation or organization who sponsored it. \n\nFeel free to criticize me up and down for this opinion, but I really believe the most dysfunctional aspect of American government at the moment is it's relationship with private entities. Even potentially good ideas like the ACA and healthcare market places will be and have been stunted by the private money involved. We have bloated and ineffective school systems for many reasons, but one major one that all the educators I know of attest to is the relationship between union negotiators and overpaid administrators. The losers here are the kids and teachers. \n\nI think that as a rule, every new area of the market economy that we bring under regulation will spawn bureaucracies and private firms seeking to benefit from the those bureaucracy. \n\nYou can't buy something from someone if they don't own it. That sounds simple but what I'm trying to illustrate is how government is a conduit or doorway to allow private interests to control a thing that would typically be distributed by the market. Even Sweden understood this back when they deregulated their markets heavily in the 90's. \n\nSo, my solution isn't pure libertarianism or laissez faire capitalism. I don't know what the right answer is. I do think there needs to be more and better protections in place that separate private entities from public money. I don't think there is a system out there that directly addresses this (what I believe to be) very core issue of inequality and corruption. \n", "id": "t1_cdbu1mp", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "MrDeepAKAballs", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1qcx7k", "id": "t1_cdc3e5l", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "StationaryBandit", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1qcx7k", "selftext": "Excellent answer.

Environmentalists and capitalists are not fast allies. Indeed, for the reasons you mentioned above they are often at odds. Free markets still have a way of dealing with pollution however. Consider the proactive efforts of thousands of companies local and large who have realized the marketing appeal of being a \"green\" company. The demand for environmentally conscience companies has had a huge impact on the way companies are run far beyond what is actually regulated by the government. This is an effect from the free market. As little as the large corporations care about the environment in favor of profits, they are forced to care because more and more people want to do business with eco friendly businesses, plain and simple. \n\nBack to my original question, which was borne of genuine curiosity, I don't understand the link or \"relationship\" if you will, between socialism and environmentalism especially when you consider the wastefulness of socialist systems. I understand that socialism is a post-scarcity ideal (let me know when we hit that point) but while we are still facing the problem of allocating scarce resources most efficiently, socialism falls quite a ways short because of the lack of incentive to squeeze every last drop of use that you can out of a piece of property or industrial machine. \n\nAddendum: This is not an argument for lassiez faire capitalism. \n", "id": "t1_ca2llfp", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "MrDeepAKAballs", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ekabv", "selftext": "I think environmentalism is difficult to reconcile with either ideology, because both capitalism and socialism have goals that are tangential at best with environmentalism. Capitalism wants to create as much individual choice as possible to create a free market and competition. Socialism wants to create an efficient market and cooperation by state allocation. \n\nThe environmental problems that arise with socialism come about, because government inefficiencies translate into waste. ie. government predicts that 100 units of washing machines will be in demand in a certain region and produces those 100 units, however unforeseen circumstances result in only 40 being purchased, creating resource waste of 60 washing machines.\n\nOr lets say the government predicts a drought causing a major food crisis and over-fertilizes land and causes massive deforestation to make way for new cropland. However, the drought never comes and the soil is ruined.\n\nBut about your point with \"green\" companies, many of the green policies of the company tend to have little, if any, environmental impact and serve a purely marketing purpose.

I can only understand what your opinion is, and question it, when I assess the validity of it to the 'real world', by obtaining all the information that is necessary for understanding what you think. That's also why it's interesting for me; because there's no 'right', because there's only opinion.

I'm writing in layman terms, for this post. Specifically for you. Any background beyond basic ideological phrases is enough to pull you through my writing style in the previous posts.

This allows more precise planing and less waste as you can only produce the things that people actually need.\n\nWhat? You're not addressing the question here. I asked for evidence of the application of socialism in demonstrating that it can 'make a better use of resources'. This statement is in itself so vague, and you're not expanding upon what you mean when you attempt to explain rudimentary economic suppositions; furthermore, you've completely ignored a request for which strand of socialism you're discussing.

Dirty water jeopardizes the health of many individuals living on the river basin, a lifeless river destroys fisheries, tourism, and other aquatic commerce industries on the river.\n\nSo the net effect for the economy is negative, but the business dumping the waste is profiting. This also means any solution to the problem suffers from the tragedy of the commons; there is no advantage for me to fix the waste dumping over someone else fixing the waste dumping. Any self-interested entity that wished to solve the problem would refuse to expend enormous economic cost when an alternative actor could just as easily spend their money. \n\nThis is why regulated capitalism is the best solution.

Thank you for your input. You didn't answer my question however. Environmentalists and capitalists are not fast allies. Indeed, for the reasons you mentioned above they are often at odds. Free markets still have a way of dealing with pollution however. Consider the proactive efforts of thousands of companies local and large who have realized the marketing appeal of being a \"green\" company. The demand for environmentally conscience companies has had a huge impact on the way companies are run far beyond what is actually regulated by the government. This is an effect from the free market. As little as the large corporations care about the environment in favor of profits, they are forced to care because more and more people want to do business with eco friendly businesses, plain and simple. \n\nBack to my original question, which was borne of genuine curiosity, I don't understand the link or \"relationship\" if you will, between socialism and environmentalism especially when you consider the wastefulness of socialist systems. I understand that socialism is a post-scarcity ideal (let me know when we hit that point) but while we are still facing the problem of allocating scarce resources most efficiently, socialism falls quite a ways short because of the lack of incentive to squeeze every last drop of use that you can out of a piece of property or industrial machine. \n\nAddendum: This is not an argument for lassiez faire capitalism. \n", "id": "t1_ca2llfp", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "MrDeepAKAballs", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ekabv", "selftext": "I think environmentalism is difficult to reconcile with either ideology, because both capitalism and socialism have goals that are tangential at best with environmentalism.
