Syria has advanced anti-aircraft systems sold to them by the Russians and an extensive network at that, designed to assist Iran in the event of an Israeli strike on Iran. A no-fly zone entails gaining air superiority and destroying all threats to our aircraft. That would mean an extensive bombing campaign to take out anti-aircraft systems and Syrian airbases. Furthermore, it would require aircraft to eliminate Syrian or Hezbollah troops that pose a threat to our aircraft (RPGs, MANPADS, etc). So, basically, huge risk of collateral damage, civilian casualties, large-scale bombing campaign, and direct risk of American pilots.\n\nSecond, this may not be effective given our stated goals behind attacking Syria. The Syrian conflict has been ongoing for years, the only reason large-scale US intervention is being pushed now is because of chemical weapons and the threat they represent to international norms. If the US were to strike, it must make it clear that the reason it is doing so is to enforce international law and prevent chemical weapon usage rather than advancing its own international political goals. This means a US missile strike should be concentrated on Syrian military apparatus that are directly related to chemical weapons production, storage, and deployment. A no-fly zone does not affect chemical weapons production or storage and it only prevents aerial chemical weapon deployment, as opposed to artillery or direct deployment. \n\nIf we were to attack Syria, the best way to facilitate US goals would be to strike bases that store chemical weapons, testing sites, potential chemical weapons plants, and missile/artillery installations.", "id": "t1_cc3k3nc", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1lwe9e", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1429559222, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1lwe9e", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cc3k3nc", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1378564806", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}

That's true freedom - being allowed to make stupid decisions.\n\nThe other problem with your argument is that the Democratic and Republican parties are *huge* tents that cover all sorts of beliefs.  (We always hear them talking about a \"big tent\" but that's really just trying to poach non-traditional alliances).  There are very libertarian Democrats and very libertarian Republicans.  There are very authoritarian of both as well (Bloomberg is a great example for a Republican as Reid/Kennedy is for a Democrat).

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ixnr0", "selftext": "Okay, so the 2009 financial crisis was underway and unemployment was skyrocketing. When less people have jobs or when people take salary cuts (as what happens in a financial crisis or economic downturn), less money can be spent consuming goods and services. This causes a decline in demand for goods and services, because people cutback on purchases so they can get on their feet.\n\nUnfortunately, when demand falls, businesses no longer need to maintain their relatively high numbers of workers. A factory that employed 100 people to produce 100 goods will lose out to a factory that employs 50 people to produce 30 goods if those factories are only able to sell 30-40 goods. So layoffs make perfect financial sense for each individual business.\n\nIn economic downturns everyone cuts back spending - people stop buying goods, this causes businesses to shed off excess employees and production capability (because it is a waste of money to be maintain employees and production when 2 employees make 5 products, 1 employee can make 2 products, and people are only buying 2 products instead of 5.)\n\nThis causes businesses to lay people off and begin cutting salaries. This furthers the economic decline, because people have less income and demand declines even further\n\nThe problem here is that this exacerbates the demand crisis and causes employment to spiral downwards as less consumers = less producers = less jobs = less consumers.\n\nSo businesses were sitting on huge piles of cash, but had no incentive to spend or invest, because the economic environment they were in meant that any unnecessary spending had no benefit because of a critical lack of consumers.\n\nEconomists agree that eventually unemployment would've bottomed out and growth would've slowly returned, maybe over the course of a decade or quite a few years.\n\nFor a government attempting to ensure the quality of life of its citizens and promote the general welfare, this is an unacceptable outcome, because it would mean years of pain and suffering for citizens. This created enormous political incentive for the government to do something.\n\nSo what should be done? If collapsing demand is the problem, then how can the government stop/reverse that trend?\n\nStimulus.\n\nHow stimulus works is the government employs people directly, issues work contracts to businesses (notably construction with infrastructure), provides tax breaks and tax returns to get people spending again.\n\nNow the government could just give free money to everyone, but this is inefficient for a few reasons. First, the government wouldn't actually get any work done in return. By employing people, at least we get infrastructure projects completed in exchange for cash. Second, it doesn't prepare people to sustain themselves for an actual job, ie. they need job training. Third, employing people to build things creates a multiplier effect.\n\nThe multiplier effect is when money gets spend along a supply chain to create exponential economic growth. ie. the government contracts a construction company to build a highway. The gov pays them $50 million. The company pays $40 million for the required steel to build the highway. The steel mill pays $30 million for the iron ore to refine into the steel the construction company paid for. The iron mine pays $20 million to expand mining operations from the original construction company. So not only did the original $50 million government investment  generate an additional $90 million in economic growth, but it also promoted cyclical growth, where now that money can self-sustain itself.\n\nAll the companies in that supply chain also have to hire new workers to accommodate for the initial rise in demand created by the government investment. Those new workers will spend their newfound income on a variety of consumer goods and services, creating economic growth in sectors that are unrelated to the initial construction company.\n\nIf the stimulus is large enough/if enough money is pumped into the economy, the economy should become self-sustaining. \n\nThere are two types of deficits - cyclical and structural. Structural deficits are deficits that are run because in a budget a government (or household) is purposefully spending more than it takes in, cyclical deficits are the result of a poor economy and put the government into deficit because of less tax income, higher spending on the social safety net, and etc. Cyclical deficits also influence households. In economic downturns, most businesses will cut payrolls and as a result may push a family into cyclical debt, that is NOT because a family is spending too much.\n\nWhat stimulus does is the government runs structural deficits to counteract cyclical deficits. It contracts out companies or directly hires public sector employees. With all these new projects and employees comes direct increased employment and therefore incomes. The fact that these jobs are temporary is irrelevant. Other companies then have a financial incentive to begin producing more to accommodate for the temporary rise in demand for goods and services. This causes businesses to rehire people and then incomes actually raise and demand is now on sustainable growth.\n\nNow, about the economic effects of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)...\n\nFirst, [GDP is sluggishly and erratically growing.](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-growth) I think this is a good indicator that we're probably headed for better times, though there is still a risk of an economic shock pulling us under.\n\nSecond, [the unemployment rate has been steadily declining.](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/unemployment-rate) Unfortunately, some of that decline can be attributed to [people dropping out of the workforce](http://blog.heritage.org/2012/12/07/unemployment-rate-drop-due-to-workers-leaving-labor-force/) and job growth also has to keep pace with new members of the work force. Thus indicating sluggish growth in job markets. Unemployment usually isnt a good indicator of the state of the economy though, because [it lags behind actual economic growth by several months.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/09/barack-obama/obama-says-job-growth-always-lags-behind-economic-/)\n\nThirdly, corporate profits are at record highs, [with a record $2.1 trillion in liquid assets (14.2% of all dollars) sitting in corporate coffers](http://investorplace.com/2012/02/where-did-all-the-money-go/)\n\nFourthly, [productive capacity is far below the normal rate, with slow growth](http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/current/)\n\nFifth, [corporate executives cite a collapse of demand for goods and services as the number one reason for why they have held off hiring and investment](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-57405230/demand-not-supply-is-restraining-the-economy/)\n\nBasically where we're at is corporations have amassed a ton of wealth but aren't spending it. You can't really blame them for saving it though. Erratic economic growth and sluggish growth in job markets means that people don't have any money to buy goods and services, so there is no profit motive for companies to hire more people to increase supply, because they are already running excesses of supply. That's why companies shed tons of workers in the form of layoffs. \n\n[There seems to be consensus (92%) among economists that the 2009 stimulus created jobs](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/the-u-s-economic-policy-debate-is-a-sham.html). The CBO found that the 2009 stimulus raised GDP by about 3.4% and added almost 2.7 million jobs to the economy.\n\nIn my opinion, stimulus wasn't large enough. There was political incentive to stimulate the economy, but there's also large political incentives to avoid excessive spending. Politicians watered down the stimulus, by reducing the amount of investment and by redirecting funds to less productive projects.\n\nTL;DR Good, but not enough.\n", "id": "t1_cb9ne6z", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ixnr0", "id": "t1_cbdhn8z", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "dargscisyhp", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cb9ne6z", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1430005154, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I apologize for the slow response, but wow.

The argument that Britain was an ocean away and information from the colonies would take weeks/months to reach them.\n\nRegionalism was an aspect of the small states vs large states conflict. It was a manifestation of the same abhorrence over foreign oppression. This is why the Articles of Confederation granted so much autonomy to states and very little power to the federal government. \n\nThen, with the Philadelphia constitutional convention, the new constitution was drafted to carefully balance the need for state autonomy and federal power. Part of this was the electoral college. Additionally, many of the founding fathers were afraid of giving too much power to the masses, for fear of 'mob rule'. This may be because many of the founding fathers were already elites in American society.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Not so important, what matters most is that our creditors believe that the US has the ability to pay back the debt with interest on time consistently in the future.\n\nWhat's important to understand is that a government is not like a household. Governments, specifically the US, has to make major budget decisions in advance, often by a year or more. This is because the government has an obligation to give citizens, organizations, and businesses to adjust to these laws. However, revenue fluctuates each year and governments may have to borrow some money to cover overhead. The government has the ability to constantly take on massive debts, because as long as the economy grows at a reasonable pace, then tax revenue will rise (more people have jobs, average income increases) and the government doesn't have to spend as much of social safety net programs (Less homeless and impoverished means the gov doesnt have to spend as much on food aid or other programs). So assuming consistent economic growth, taking on large debts is a way to functionally increase the resources the government can leverage at any one time for a small price in the future. \n\nFor example, GDP in 1985 was about $4.3 trillion. In 2000, that more than doubled and reached $10 trillion. Let's say the government in 1985 says, hey you give us $100 now and we'll give you that back, PLUS $5 more in 15 years. This is beneficial for the government, because that $100 can be invested in boosting economic growth and other government services. Even if that money doesn't go towards any economic growth, the natural growth of the economy should allow us to easily pay it off. Let's say 5% of the economic growth over the course of 15 years goes to government income. That 5% interest rate can easily be paid back when no factors other than the economy are taken into account. \n\nIt's beneficial for the creditor, because they make profit over that time. If interest rates were too high then the government would offer that at all and governments represent the ultimate safe investment over time. Banks can fail, but government failure is rare (this is where the importance of perception of debt comes into play.)\n\nSo, the debt really isnt an issue when the economy is functioning perfectly fine. Because even if we have to pay more and more money in interest to finance our debts, economic growth will naturally pay it off for us. \n\n[This](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/US_Federal_Debt_as_Percent_of_GDP_by_President.jpg) graph really demonstrates this. Not only does the national debt, even though it's skyrocketing in real terms ($17 trillion, holy shit!!), it really isn't much when compared to the size of our economy ($15 quadrillion). (BTW I'm sorry the graph is organized by presidential party, I'm not really trying to make a statement about which party is preferential or even which presidents are good.)\n\nBut then recession hits. \n\nThis is when debt skyrockets, the government loses millions of taxpayers and even then has to start paying for them in the forms of unemployment benefits. Paul Krugman estimates that around half of our current deficit is \"cyclical\", that it is a function of the slow growth we have now. \n\nWith much less revenue and higher cyclical deficits, governments (local, state, and government) have enormous pressures to lower their structural deficit (actual budget decisions). Unfortunately, this austerity lowers demand and can exacerbate economic crisis, making the debt problem even worse.\n\nSo if you're a credit agency that provides reports on how safe it is to invest in government debt, at this time it may look like the government might have trouble paying you back in the future. So less people loan the government money, because the risk that they won't be paid back reliably has lowered. \n\nThe government, in an effort to raise revenue at this pressing time, is forced to raise interest rates on many of these bonds to provide more incentive in loaning the government money. So a high debt (adjusted for GDP) can raise interest rates and make all debt even more expensive to pay back in time. Even a .5% increase in interest rates can increase deficits by hundreds of billions. \n\nTL;DR, debt doesn't matter. Debt adjusted for GDP matters, because it can raise interest rates and make it harder for the government to operate since it has less money.\n", "id": "t1_cat2h6c", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Not only does the national debt, even though it's skyrocketing in real terms ($17 trillion, holy shit!!), it really isn't much when compared to the size of our economy ($15 quadrillion). \n\nYou might want to check your GDP number.

But, I don't think it's as malicious as most people think.\n\nAll of the following scenarios assume a completely benevolent politician attempting to act in the interest of everyone.\n\nFirst, a politician may honestly believe that they can fulfill all the promises they have given. This is reasonable, because if it's your first time running for a particular office, you are inherently unfamiliar with the various constraints of that office. The presidential position particularly suffers, because the president is supposed to be the representative of the entire country and as such most blame and credit goes to the president. This hypes up the actual duties and powers of the president and someone running for that office may genuinely believe that they can do these things. However, once taking office, they get briefed on a variety of classified information that sways their position, political realities constrain a promised policy (ie let's say Obama says that everyone deserves free daily ice cream, but other politicians don't agree and destroy it.), economic realities may constrain it (not enough room in the budget), the president changes mind, or a variety of other causes. This is less likely from people who have held political positions before, but it's still a possibility nonetheless.\n\nSecond, a candidate may have a specific agenda of a few items they want to get done, recognizing the constraints listed above, but no presidential candidate can just go out there and give a speech that says \"Hey, I want to accomplish health-care reform and tackle climate change, there's other stuff I want to do as well, but I just can't do it!\" They will not get elected compared to the guy who says \"DO EVERYTHING!\". \n\nThird, they may not have an opinion formulated on a specific issue on the campaign and make vague statements about it to get them by in the meantime, and they can clarify later. These can be misinterpreted.\n\nFable 3 is a great example of this (spoiler alert). You lead a revolution and topple a dictator. To gain support for your revolution you have to make promises to specific groups, organizations, and constituencies. Once in power though, you learn that the previous king was being tyrannical to prepare defenses for a coming onslaught that wiped out a neighboring kingdom. So when you are on the throne with a limited budget, you have to compromise the promises you made earlier to go towards defense. The more promises you fulfill, the less money is available for defense, and more citizens die.\n\n", "id": "t1_cat2mcr", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1hcp4z", "id": "t1_cath7ze", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "bacteriadude", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cat2mcr", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430626566, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I see where you're going with the fable 3 comparison, but wouldn't it have been easier on the politician to just tell people about the imminent threat?

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1hcuj7", "selftext": "There are a few reasons why the US military budget is so exorbitantly high and why it is difficult to lower.\n\nFirst and foremost are the objectives the US is trying to achieve. As the world's first hyperpower, the US is attempting to maintain its hegemony by projecting global power. This is part of the doctrine of a global strike force and being able to attack any part of the world within 30 mins of an order. The United States is employing this to secure its position as the only superpower, ensuring security for allies and attempting to keep peace around the world, or if necessary, employ force to accomplish other US objectives. This is part of the hard power / soft power theory of international relations. Soft power is when countries want to be like the US and they like us so they naturally align themselves with our interests. Hard power is when we use military to coerce, provide security, or just establish dominance to force states to align with us to be associated with our military power. A persuasive argument I find is that if the defense budget is credibly reduced, then our allies will have to spend more on defense, which can fuel regional arms races.\n\nSecond is the post-9/11 security environment. After 9/11, lawmakers were forced to center their foreign policy around terrorism, a threat that is notoriously difficult to eradicate. The emotional impact of 9/11 forced these legislators to allocate a disproportionate amount of funds to accomplish counterterrorism for both a fear of looking weak on terrorism and to compensate for the huge impact 9/11 was to the US. Military spending after 9/11 mushroomed from $300 bil/year to $900 bil/year. The problem though is that terrorism is difficult to solve, especially through military usage, so this has resulted in expensive military operations in Afghanistan and around the world as part of the Global War on Terror, employing thousands of troops to hunt down enemies. This also justified a policy of preemptive intervention and conflict. After 9/11, we realized all the signs had been before us and it was a failure to act that allowed the WTC towers to fall. This created pretense for expensive TSA scanners, domestic police operations, the Iraq conflict, and is creating a pretense for an Iran strike now. The US is now in a lose-lose situation with terrorism, current operations are extremely expensive in terms of blood and treasure and aren't really making too much of an impact on the forces of terrorism. So if we stop spending, we will look weak in the face of terrorism, not accomplishing many objectives in recent years and may weaken America's reputation, because we had already built up so much momentum to support the Global War on Terror, that the international community is so steadfast in our prior convictions, that each country is afraid of being critical of the Global War on Terror for fear of a loss of diplomatic credibility or simply reputation. If the US continues operations though, spending will continue to constrain US budgets, lives will be lost, more terrorist forces could be recruited in reaction to a perceived imperialist foreign policy, and the US will look weak for failing to stamp out some of the weakest enemies we have ever faced.\n\nThird, is that the massive military expenditures have funded an entire industry of constituents who fear for their job. Expensive military development boondoggles are almost never put on the chopping bucket, because these projects create hundreds of jobs. Massive production to support the military directly provides various industries with employment.\n\nFourth, is the economy. The Diversionary theory of foreign policy argues that democracies are more likely to employ their military when the economy (or generally popularity) is low in order to shift focus away from domestic problems and cause the country to rally around the flag in a foreign conflict. This is why Bush possessed the highest popularity rating immediately after 9/11 and is why before elections we tend to see conflict or a refusal to engage in peace. Nixon told South Vietnam to refuse to negotiate peace terms until after he was elected, Bush started the Iraq war a year before the 2004 elections, Obama employed military action against Libya in 2011, and he was forced to appeal to Israeli voters by stating that a military option against Iran was on the table. This also explains why wartime presidents tend to be our most popular.\n\nTL;DR: Hard power, 9/11, constituencies, and the economy all contribute to our massive military spending.", "id": "t1_catalt1", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1hcuj7", "score": 6, "retrieved_on": 1430630514, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_catalt1", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1372618983", "ups": 6, "distinguished": null}

People will then subconsciously incorporate that information into their own beliefs.

This in itself is a problem with major media outlets. The fact that people can \"agree\" with a NEWS SOURCE is troubling to say the least. News should present facts and let viewers reach their own conclusions.\n\nYou mention TV news; Fox and MSNBC, specifically. Here are some problems I have with major TV news outlets\n\n1. Ideological Agenda - mostly present in Fox and MSNBC. The problem is that Fox and MSNBC have been apparatus of the Republican and Democrat parties. The game of language concocted by GOP and Dem linguists tends to be filtered through and spread by these news networks. ie. GOP strategists start using the term Obamacare to refer to the PPACA, Fox News then begins using the term. Dem strategists call Romney's healthcare plan Romneycare, MSNBC then starts using the term. The same goes for gaffes (which I believe to be irrelevant political bullshit) and other party plans. This is due to a variety of reasons. I could talk about this much more and point to evidence on both sides, but I would like some decent sleep and this is a very telling excerpt that sums it all up from [UN election observers after the 2012 election](http://www.osce.org/odihr/96960): \n\n&gt; TV is the main source of political information, as provided though public, national, and cable \nbroadcasters.29 The presidential contest was the main focus of national media. OSCE/ODIHR \nLEOM media monitoring results show that public electronic media fulfilled their remit as public \nservice broadcasters by covering the elections and candidates in a comprehensive manner, with \nsubstantive news and analysis of the candidates\u2019 platforms and the issues. PBS evenly allocated \nairtime in news and current affairs programmes between Barack Obama (53 per cent) and Mitt \nRomney (47 per cent) that was balanced in tone. Likewise, NPR coverage was equitable, with 45 \nper cent devoted to Obama and 55 per cent to Romney, and was balanced in tone. The main national \nnetworks also provided equitable coverage of Obama (50 per cent) and Romney (50 per cent) that \nwas also balanced in tone. \nIn contrast, **leading cable TV channels were highly partisan in their election coverage**, with both \nObama and Romney receiving more negative than positive coverage. Fox News dedicated 66 per \ncent of its coverage to Obama and 34 per cent to Romney. **Coverage of Obama on Fox News was \nmostly negative in tone (72 per cent).** MSNBC dedicated 34 per cent of its coverage to Obama and \n66 per cent to Romney. **Coverage of Romney on MSNBC was mostly negative in tone (87 per \ncent).**\nAll broadcast media dedicated the greater part of their electoral coverage to non-substantive issues \nsuch as daily opinion polls and the holding of campaign events (64 per cent), often at the expense of \nsubstantive discussion of policy (36 per cent). Press and online media provided extensive and \ncomprehensive coverage of the elections, often with a greater focus on policy issues.\n\n2. Hype - John Stewart put it best when he described major news outlets as \"being built for one thing: 9/11\". 24 hours news networks are designed with the purpose of ACTION NEWS HOLY SHIT LOOK WHAT'S GOING ON. But the problem is, actual times when those happen are quite rare and a news network can't go on the air and go \"yeah, not much is happening today\". TV networks have to justify their own existence by conflating the importance of news stories and giving more air time to stories than they deserve and by hyping up every news story so that it is 9/11. TV news networks promote the attitude that something big is happening all the time which fosters negative, inflammatory, and provocative rhetoric which turns into actual negativity and actual partisanship.\n\n3. Breaking news vs accurate news - In order to accomplish the action news feel, many major TV news networks have had to compromise the accuracy of their news to secure early leads and exclusive information early in the development of a story. This is precisely why CNN fumbled the Boston attacks and why almost every news outlet falsely reported the results of the 2000 election.\n\n\nEvery news source suffers its own problems, the only way to accommodate this is to read a diversity of sources and reconcile the information.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1h2uhk", "selftext": "The problem with Voter ID laws is that they can disenfranchise a significant number of voters while gaining little to no benefit.\n\nThe SCOTUS ruled that poll taxes (pay to vote) are unconstitutional, because every man has a right to vote and that cost can deter and make it impossible for some people to vote. They further ruled that they are discriminatory against minorities, considering many minorities are in a worse socioeconomic condition. In the same way that literacy tests to vote were ruled as discriminatory, poll taxes can be used as a method to suppress minority voters. \n\nIt was ruled that Voter ID laws have to be free, otherwise they constitute an effective poll tax. So, states started giving out voter IDs for free, what's the problem?\n\nThey still impose a significant indirect financial cost that disproportionately affects the poor. First, requisite documentation can disqualify elderly voters and costs money to reproduce if you lost your first copy of your birth certificate. It may be impossible for some elderly voters to receive the requisite documentation, because most states only started keeping birth certificate records around the 1940s, this means anyone who was born around this timeframe may not be able to retrieve a birth certificate needed to obtain a voter ID. This is an [excerpt](http://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/policy-brief-voter-identification) from the Brennan center:\n\n&gt; A would-be voter must pay substantial fees both for ID cards and the backup documents needed to get them-up to $100 for a driver\u2019s license, up to $45 for a birth certificate, $97 for a passport, and over $200 for naturalization papers. The voter may also have to take several hours off of work and travel significant distances to visit government offices open only during select daytime hours. Finally, many identifying documents cannot be issued immediately, so potential voters must allow for processing and shipping, which may take from several weeks to an entire year.\n\nMany of the people who don't have an ID are the same people who don't have access to transportation or a drivers license. They must pay to get a drivers license and then travel to their nearest government office (usually a DMV) to get their voter ID. This can impose financial opportunity cost on many people. The travel itself can take hours, lines can also take a significant amount of time, and these problems are amplified because DMVs in rural areas, areas where most people don't have voter ID, are only open select hours on certain days of the year. ie. the DMV in Sauk City is only open 4 times a year, so it's a significant hassle to retrieve voter ID. Many poor may opt-out of getting their ID, because that's time they need to spend working to obtain an income. \n\nA minor point aside from the financial discrimination is that minorities are asked much more frequently if they have ID.\n\n&gt; Not only are minority voters less likely to possess photo ID, but they are also more likely than white voters to be selectively asked for ID at the polls. For example, in New York City, which has no ID requirement, a study showed that poll workers illegally asked one in six Asian Americans for ID at the polls, while white voters were permitted to vote without showing ID.\n\nBut that shouldn't be a problem, because most people already have requisite voting ID, right?\n\nA study by the Brennan Center concluded that at least 10% of the population does not have requisite voter ID. The problem is much more significant though, because most voter ID laws require your current address to be displayed on your ID. Many minority, student, and elderly voters have ID that doesn't meet this requirement. \n\n&gt; Thirty-six percent of Georgians over 75 do not have a driver\u2019s license. Fewer than 3 percent of Wisconsin students have driver\u2019s licenses listing their current address. The same study found that African Americans have driver\u2019s licenses at half the rate of whites, and the disparity increases among younger voters; only 22% of black men aged 18-24 had a valid driver\u2019s license.\n\nBut hey, it helps reduce voter fraud right?\n\nOf the 600 million ballots cast since 2000, [there were only 10](http://votingrights.news21.com/article/election-fraud/) alleged cases of in-person voter fraud, which is the only fraud that voter ID solves. Real fraud exists that is unaffected by voter ID laws. Mail-in ballot fraud , vote purging, and improper vote counting are all real fraud problems our election system has that need to be taken care of.\n\nVoter ID prevents millions of otherwise eligible Americans from voting. The Americans prevented from voting are overwhelming elderly, youth, minority, and poor voters. It imposes significant financial costs on both the government and her citizens.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "First, I'd like to say that cooperation between all 50 states is rare and when it does work, it's because of the federal government (National Minimum Drinking Age Act). Cooperation between various groups of states is frequent and usually works, but sometimes affects non-affiliated states, which is why all interstate compacts need the technical approval of congress. The federal government is necessary to act on matters which serves everyone's interests, but can be difficult/impossible to do effectively on the state level. Government is designed to prevent free riders.\n\n* **1. Defense / Natural Disasters**\n\nThis is probably one of the biggest and easiest examples to provide a case for the federal government. If there were no federal role in the military, then our national defense would be severely compromised. Let's use the scenario of a Chinese invasion of the west coast. \n\nFirst, before the invasion even happens, the preparations will be handicapped. California begins crying for help, asking for munitions, troops, and other forms of aid. Most people on the west coast volunteer to fight, their homes are in direct threat. Some people in the central US volunteer, acknowledging that if California doesn't stop them, then they're next. Aid from the east coast trickles in, partially because since all the states had their equipment at home rather than on the coasts already, there's a massive logistical effort to transport all the aid to California. Additionally, many people on the east coast see this as charity/something that doesn't affect them much. If California doesn't stop them, then the central US will, and the east can always pitch in then if that's really necessary. The problem of regionalism is exacerbated by the fact that many states have different resources available to them, let's say Alabama has an extensive arms industry and doesn't see too much need to defend California, so they charge them exorbitant prices for top of the line defenses. This is happening with every state, with states only offering their support if they get something in exchange, taking advantage of the west coast's predicament. California is bankrupted before the Chinese even arrive and even if they repel them completely, they will still be bankrupt and their economy will still be in shambles. People, for the most part, act in their own self-interest, a trait rewarded by capitalism. It works out for the most part, but we need more government and cooperation to prevent many of these travesties from happening. \n\nSecond, Chinese boats are approaching the shore and artillery begins pounding the coastline. Our Air Forces are stuck in a bureaucratic mess, since all the states sent over various models of aircraft of varying combat readiness that all use their own different armaments. Equipment failure is common and coordination fails as many different bomber squadrons destroy the same target over and over. \n\nInterstate squads are woefully unprepared, as they know nothing about each other, don't have uniform communication, ammunition, tactics, or even leaders. This is why the defense is organized by state, which jeopardizes the defense as most state forces hold back, believing someone else will make the riskier move to save everyone. Forces from one state retreat while forces from another advance, creating chaos. After seeing the results of the battle, many states begin shoehorning Chinese language classes, but states are split between Mandarin and Cantonese, fostering conflict in the new Chinese territory. \n\n* **2. Foreign Policy**\n\nCanada is very confused when the embassy they built for us is filled with 50 different ambassadors and their own independent entourage. None of them can agree on anything and nothing gets done. The complexities multiply when multiple nations are involved. The state department in each state must reach a conclusion and then attempt to reach a compromise amongst all the states. Texas attempts to declare war on Mexico, surrounding states quickly attempt damage-control by telling Mexico that Texas didn't mean that. Mexico doesn't care and invades, but doesn't really know where to stop. More likely, Texas wins and incorporates all of Mexico into it's government, significantly increasing it's power. \n\n* **3. Rights and Liberties**\n\nIssues of human rights and liberties need to be settled by a larger government. Not only would all 50 states have to agree upon which rights were actually human rights, but then there would also be immense confusion as to how those are interpreted and applied. Pretty much everyone agreed that all people should be treated equally, but what does equal mean. Separate but equal doctrines and segregation were taken out by a federal interpretation of the constitution and human rights. The time it would have taken many states in the deep south to eventually repeal segregation laws would have taken far too long, and some may even still be around today. \n\n* **4. The Economy and Interstate infrastructure**\n\nNational economic issues should be influenced by a national government, it is their responsibility, because they can do it most efficiently and to solve the free rider problem. 2009 financial crisis - the economy of every state was plummeting fast, no one could agree on the proper course of action. Even if you don't agree with the 2009 stimulus, one should recognize that on issues of the national economy, there is a need for the nation as a whole to act in unison, because any policy otherwise would be split in half. I'm going to oversimplify the economics debate to the question of spend more / save less for the purpose of time and my sanity. Let's say half the states implemented stimulus efforts and the other half implemented austerity measures. These two policies would counteract each other and result in nothing happening, except some states would have budget surpluses and some states would have massive deficits. But it had a net zero effect on the economy. \n\nThe federal government also has a role in coordinating and planning interstate infrastructure. Our national power grid is a perfect example of what happens when the federal government isnt in charge of a major national infrastructure project. Each of the fifty states created their own grid and then connected them to each other, creating a loose patchwork of an electric grid. The problem is now, that it is very difficult to transmit energy over multiple states, which is slowing the development of alternative energy, because wind turbines only make sense in windy areas, but those tend to be very far away from where most energy is used. So our inefficient grid is resulting in getting much less bang for our buck. Additionally, systemic blackouts are a very real risk. A tree branch fell on a power line in 2003 and wiped out the entire northeast power grid, including Quebec. If the grid was constructed by the federal government, many of these power problems could be averted. \n\nThis contrasts with the grand network of interstate highways, which today is a marvel of engineering and a result of brilliant federal planning. Let's say a small rural state didn't want to build a vital part of a highway in their state, because it would only result in people leaving their state and local farmers were complaining about the plans. Even if a neighboring state offers to pay for all of the construction, this state would still refuse and would demand large financial compensation, resulting in the costs of the project skyrocketing, no unified standards would degrade the quality of the system, and no planning means it would be very difficult for someone to drive easily from state to state.\n", "id": "t1_cansmj3", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1gssc6", "score": 8, "retrieved_on": 1430725435, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1gssc6", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cansmj3", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1371866380", "ups": 8, "distinguished": null}

Here's an excerpt from an essay I wrote on the subject that argues that the only thing that mattered was the corruption and unpopularity of the Southern Vietnamese government.\n\nThe proximate cause of the conflict appeared to be that the Southern government was corrupt and undemocratic. This government was headed by a fraudulently elected Ngo Diem, a staunch US-backed anti-communist. He persecuted Buddhists that further exacerbated his unpopularity amongst the Vietnamese. The Vietnamese had been long fighting for independence, with nationalist leaders such as Ho Chi Minh receiving much popular support, which did not reconcile with Diem\u2019s ties with foreign powers (the United States). Diem\u2019s government was riddled with corruption, with consolidation of personal power and a failure to properly represent the people of Vietnam. With the Soviets occupying the North, they represented the least-bad alternative for many of Vietnam\u2019s people. The unrest with Diem\u2019s government lead to a popular political movement to throw him out and unite Vietnam as an independent nation above all else. It was not within the US\u2019 responsibility or jurisdiction to deploy military forces to sustain a corrupt unpopular government. This action backfired miserably on the United States. Diem\u2019s government lost almost all legitimacy as it became dependent on foreign support, feeding nationalist concerns about independence. It also associated the US with a corrupt democracy, hurting our international reputation as a democratic power. Not only did this mean the war would be unwinnable (as opposition forces would have a replenishable supply of recruits and political will) but that the conflict would be bloody and foster anti-Americanism.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1fcn7n", "selftext": "Some may call me a liberal, so take the following with a grain of sand:\n\n1. Lobbyism is successful for a multitude of reasons. \n\n[There's a critical staffing shortage in Washington](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jun/6/congressional-staffers-public-shortchanged-by-high/?page=all). This means that a small number of congressmen, having to represent a multitude of interests that include subjects they know nothing about, are forced to seek out sources of information. Given the shortage of congressional staffers and offices, lobbyists offer a free, convenient, and abundant source of information. Many lobbyists have spent their entire lives being involved in a certain subject and are thus preferable to the uneducated youth who populate congressional offices. The problem is that many lobbyists are biased and their presentations are skewed towards one side. This wouldn't be a problem if all sides were represented equally, but business can afford to send more lobbyists than other interest groups (environmental, union, citizen). 3/4 of all lobbying money is spent by business lobbies and business lobbies outnumber all other ones on a 16:1 ratio. This results in congressmen getting information skewed in favor of big business. Big business can afford to pay these congressmen a lot of money, because lobbyists save them quite a bit of money by ensuring a favorable regulatory process. Another problem with lobbyism is the revolving door, where government insiders leave to work in a corporation. They can abuse previous relationships they had with standing congressmen and can effectively leverage their extensive knowledge of inside politics. The London School of Economics estimated that 56% of the revenue generated by private lobbying between 1998 and 2008 came from lobbyists with federal government experience and that 34 of top 50 lobbyists have experience in the federal government.\n\n2. Third parties play an important but fundamentally counterintuitive role in politics. The first past the post (FPTP) system in the United States basically says that whoever wins a plurality of votes in an election wins 100% of the power associated with that election. Essentially, there are no prizes for the runner-ups. What this means is that over time, the FPTP system creates two front-runner parties which a majority of the people do not support, this is evident in that support for congress is nearing [single digits](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/congressional_job_approval-903.html). This is because of the problem of tactical voting, where voters feel they have to vote for the least bad electable candidate. FPTP punishes voting for third parties because it results in the party you disagree with the most winning. There are two main parties in the United States, the Republicans, who are conservative, and the Democrats, who are liberal , each with roughly half the population. The next most popular party is the Libertarian party, which struggled to win [one percent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Johnson_presidential_campaign,_2012) of the national popular vote. The Libertarian party is more conservative than they are liberal, so votes for the Libertarian party tend to come from people who would have otherwise voted for the Republicans. Let's say the Libertarians go all out in an expensive campaign and manage to squeeze 5% of the vote out in a national election. This 5% primarily comes from people who would've voted Republican, so the Democrats would win the election with 50% of the vote, as opposed to the Republican's 45%, and the Libertarian's 5%. The system punishes voting for the party that's closest to what you actually believe in, by rewarding the opposing ideology. This narrows American to support only two parties, which cannot even hope to completely represent all of their constituents. So the result we see is that a vast majority of the population is unhappy with the two party system, but has to abide by it in order to prevent the greater of two evils. 32 presidential candidates were on ballots across the country in the 2012 election, but only 4 were on enough state ballots to be potentially elected. Most can name the Republican and Democrat candidates (Romney and Obama), few can name the Libertarian candidate (Gary Johnson), very few can name the Green candidate (Jill Stein), and the others are almost completely unknown, with the third party debate receiving almost no national attention (Justice Party's Rocky Anderson and Constitution Party's Virgil Goode).\n\n3. The primary difference between both parties is one of conservatives versus liberals. Conservatives are wary of change, in that it inherently implies risk, so they tend to advocate for small government and a return to old ideals. This tends to embody itself in strict following of the constitution and smaller government. Conservatives argue for strict rights of the individual, favoring little to no gun control. Conservatives are more pro-business than Liberals and therefore are very cautious of environmental and union movements, for fear of hurting the economy. This is not to say that they are against the environment or even unions, but that they tend to favor the economy over the environment or worker conditions, when prompted. Conservatives, in support of simpler times, tend to be less hostile to religious values. They believe that the answers do not lay with the government generally, but rather with the people. They want less government interference and tend to believe more strongly in property rights and less strongly in well-fare rights, holding economic equity above equality. Many republicans are religious and tend to hold to the morals characterizing the Founding Fathers, which results in general disapproval of abortions and, for some, gay marriage.\n\nThis contrasts with liberals who see a larger role for the government and advocate for progressive change to improve conditions from the past. Liberals favor a more open interpretation of the constitution. A larger role for the government goes along with their economic policies, favoring stimulus over austerity and tend to be more hostile to the concept of a balanced budget. Liberals, while also pro-business, are more favorable to environmental or worker rights regulations. Liberals idea of progressive change from the past makes them tend to be more attractive to minority groups that perceive themselves to be oppressed (basically all ethnic minorities, LGBT, women, poor). They tend to believe the government must look for the greater good above the individual person in terms of welfare and do what is necessary to make the populace more \"equal\". They assert that the values our country holds must evolve over time, and, therefore, tend to support such controversial choices as Pro Choice and gay marriage. \n\n", "id": "t1_ca94jzg", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "4.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ek0iw", "selftext": "One could consider me a liberal, so take this with a grain of sand:\n\nThe key time period you're looking for is the time period between Civil War Reconstruction and the 1920s known as the Gilded Age.\n\nThe second industrial revolution was underway in the US, this lead to massive economic growth. Between 1865 and 1898, the output of wheat increased by 256%, corn by 222%, coal by 800% and miles of railway track by 567%. This is when all those titans of industry came from; Rockefeller, Stanford, Vanderbilt, JP Morgan, Carnegie, and Mellon.  The titans of industry became philanthropists, donating vast sums of wealth to institutions in exchange for cementing their reputation in the US. Industrial innovation allowed for the corporate model and the profit focus to flourish. This boosted the efficiency of the workplace at the expense of the workers. \n\nMark Twain dubbed this period the gilded age, because booming economic growth created the illusion of good times, but underneath, prosperity was not shared. Child labor soared, extremely long hours and workdays, horrible working conditions, low pay (or being paid in company script rather than actual cash). \n\nThe concept of monopolies really came alive in this time period, with the titans of industry engaging in both horizontal monopolization (buying out opposition to corner the market) and vertical monopolization (buying out the entire supply chain to cut out the middle men and make your product extremely cheap.) Entire corporate towns popped up, where workers were paid in company script which would then go to the town store owned by the corporation, essentially resulting in the company losing no money.\n\nThe total lack of financial and labor regulations was perpetuated by corrupt politicians who were paid off by the titans of industry, not so effectively referred to as robber barons. The largest example was Boss Tweed, who would buy out political opposition and would even buy votes from poor Irish immigrants. \n\nThis lead many workers to see government as being a non-option to escape their conditions. Increasingly they resorted to grassroots collectivists movements. In the same way that the civil rights movement saw both non-violent and violent groups, the labor movement had its share of violence and then eventually resorted back to non-violent.\n\nRadicalism was answered with more radicalism. Workers who wanted to improve their conditions via unionization were fired and replaced by a more complacent worker. Strikes were answered with firing, hiring of private armies, police suppression, and being blacklisted from ever being hired at a major company again. This lead to labor riots and armed conflict between labor and business. Labor workers in the Haymarket Square Riot threw a bomb that killed four policemen. \n\nThis is probably when the US came closest to socialism, socialist and anarchist movements became extremely popular, and even President McKinley was assassinated by an anarchist. The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 was the first piece of legislation adopted by the US with the stated goal of reducing corporate influence and monopolies. It was largely ineffective though, because of its vague wording. \n\nViolence started to subside under Teddy Roosevelt, who left behind a legacy of \"trust-busting\", breaking up monopolies. This was continued by Taft and Wilson. The Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914 largely resolved most of the problems with the Sherman Act. \n\nWith legislation in place restricting big business, labor unions came to rise and violence ended. Unions became a forum for workers to communicate and address grievances with business. \n\nThe first Red Scare in 1919 in reaction to the Bolshevik revolution in Russia put down socialism and anarchism as those movements were brutally suppressed by police forces and forever made socialism a bad word in the US.\n\nSo yes, labor movement is the closest the US has ever gotten to socialism, but that hardly makes unions socialist now a days. Yes, many corporate abuses have ended and common workplace practices and safety regulations are in place, but much of that is because of the work of unions and I think some abuses would come back if the unions were to dissipate. \n\nThere are still a lot of kinks to work out with unions though. Recently we saw a lot of conflict over collective bargaining (primarily in Wisconsin, where I reside) and right to work laws. Collective bargaining is the idea that workers should be able to anonymously pool their complaints and present them as a group to their management. I support this, because I honestly don't see the problem here. Yes, it does vastly increase some of the costs of operating a business, but it's also pivotal to check horrible business practices and conditions.\n\nRight to work laws came as a result of unions requiring new employees at a company to pay union dues and join the union. I actually support these laws, because I think forcing people to join unions and pay dues is a violation of freedom of association.\n\nBut I would say that unions have had a largely beneficial and stabilizing effect on the United States, even if they cost our economy a bit, we want to avoid conditions in the Gilded Age. If we didn't have unions we would have radical and violent labor movements and would probably make socialism or anarchists tempting. So I think unions are a moderating influence and result in workers being able to engage a business rather than violently confront it.

He said that he represents over 300 non-union shops and that none of them qualify.  No-one ever said why, but considering the legislation that was passed, i'd be forced to guess that at the same time union shops weren't hiring and graduating apprentices, non-union shops weren't hiring and graduating apprentices either, and therefore can't bid on those jobs.\n\nso to recap:\n\n1. non-union shops can't bid on these jobs because they stopped hiring and graduating apprentices during the recession.\n\n2. union shops can't bid on these jobs because they stopped hiring and graduating apprentices during the recession. \"each and every one of them had a period of a couple of years where they didn't hire and graduate apprentices\" - John Morris\n\n3. city councilpeople pass ordinances to spur job creation and apprenticeship programs into the future by specifying that shops that bid on city work must be actively involved in training and graduating apprentices.  \n\n4. for the moment, this ordinance tips the scales toward those who were creating jobs in the depth of the recession, which happen to be union shops (i surmise due to some aspect of the Unions that allow them to do this in a position non-union shops can't)\n\n\ni guess i'm not very opposed to that.  while the scales are in fact tipped at the moment, as hiring picks back up, non-union shops will start to meet the requirements once again, and the playing field will level. (aka not long-term bad)  And (for reasons i'll explain below) to me the union advantage at the moment is all right by me, as they did what i would consider the heavy lifting of hiring and training during the recession.  they didn't just do what the free-market did and stop a vital part of the process.\n\nreasons explained below: i'm a recent college graduate looking for entry-level work in my field.  Lots of stuff saying \"2-5 years experience only apply\" and the like.  Not a lot of people with the ability to or willing to take chances.  So i have a bit of a soft spot for those who do this important heavy lifting.

Already, politicians are being hounded for not supporting Israel enough and there isnt even really active conflict yet. And once the US gets involved, it would rapidly escalate to protect oil interests in the Strait of Hormuz, civilian and military forces in neighboring UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Afghanistan that could be at risk from missile strikes or Hezbollah blowback. Plus, a lack of communication channels and normal fog of war makes miscommunication and miscalculation extremely likely. This combined with the anti-Americanism of the Iranian administration results in enormous political, social, and economic mandates for both Iran and the US to escalate. Even if they don't want to, because of a lack of communication, they have to assume that the other is escalating. So we'll see all-out war soon.\n\n[Iran attempts to lay mines in the Strait of Hormuz](http://www.inegma.com/reports/special%20report%204/Iranian%20Mining%20of%20the%20Strait%20of%20Hormuz.pdf), the US navy is able to destroy most of the mine ships, but some mines inevitably make it through. Global oil shipping is crippled for months as the Strait is searched for mines. This is devastating to the global economy and causes oil prices to skyrocket (some analysts predict even [doubling of global oil prices and causing a double-dip recession.](http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175496/))\n\n[War draws in Lebanon, Syria, UAE, and Saudi Arabia](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137031/colin-h-kahl/not-time-to-attack-iran) -\n\"If Iranian-allied Hezbollah responded to the fighting by firing rockets at Israeli cities, Israel could launch an all-out war against Lebanon. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad might also try to use the moment to divert attention from the uprising in his country, launching his own assault on the Jewish state. Either scenario, or their combination, could lead to a wider war in the Levant.Even in the Gulf, where U.S. partners are sometimes portrayed as passive, Iranian retaliation might draw Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates into the conflict. The Saudis have taken a much more confrontational posture toward Iran in the past year, and Riyadh is unlikely to tolerate Iranian attacks against critical energy infrastructure. For its part, the UAE, the most hawkish state in the Gulf, might respond to missiles raining down on U.S. forces at its Al Dhafra Air Base by attempting to seize Abu Musa, Greater Tunb, and Lesser Tunb, three disputed Gulf islands currently occupied by Iran.\"\n\n[War draws in Azerbaijan and Turkey](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/03/28/israel_s_secret_staging_ground?) - this inflames the Caucuses region.\n\n[If China wanted to make a play for more relative power, they could easily spur North Korea to increase aggressive action on the South](http://www.americanthinker.com/2013/04/does_an_attack_on_iran_mean_an_attack_on_south_korea.html#ixzz2QU2jpyIY), although this isn't the most likely, Chinese policymakers could easily wreck the US by doing this by embroiling US forces in both the mideast and the far east. China probably wont do this though.\n\nThere's also substantial evidence that Iran could spur proxy conflict via Hezbollah forces in Latin America. [[1]](http://www.familysecuritymatters.org/publications/detail/south-american-mexican-hezbollah-jihadis-threaten-the-united-states#ixzz2QaEkvAL0 ) [[2]](http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/10/12/why_is_iran_conspiring_with_mexican_drug_dealers) - basically with Iranian bases in Venezuela they could direct Hezbollah and influence the Cartels to attack the United States and undermine Latin American stability. Imagine the Drug War, but with Hezbollah in the mix and the massive oil revenues of Iran and Venezuela fuelling terrorists. This would also be an easy venue for a chemical, biological, radiological, or cyberattack against the United States, considering that the US-Mexican border fails to stop millions of illegal immigrants and contraband, which could be enemy combatants and weapons. \n\nMissiles shower Israel, Iran gets pounded. Imagine Iraq all over again, but far worse. The US would be forced to invade Iran and dispose of the leadership in a move similar in Iraq. Their conventional military gets shredded by our Airpower, but US forces would get quagmired for decades in fighting insurgency and quelling opposition. \n\nNuclear use probably wouldn't happen. If so, only if substantial casualties of US soldiers force military commanders to use nuclear bunker busters to destroy heavily entrenched forces. There's also a possibility of nuclear use on the Korean peninsula. \n\n\n", "id": "t1_c9z3zft", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c9z4s56", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "evansdead", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c9z3zft", "score": 13, "retrieved_on": 1431151927, "controversiality": 0, "body": "This guy has great points AND sources.

It requires maybe 2-3 decades after a president's last term in order to properly analyze their administration. \n\nBut here's what I would say right now (take with grain of sand, I support Obama, and also all information regarding his administration now is politically tinged.)\n\nEconomics\n\nObama has renewed a Keynesian precedent and expanded the role of government in the economy. The 2009 stimulus is hallmark economic legislation that is only rivaled by the New Deal. Though I support the stimulus, I don't really want to get into an economics debate, and there's clearly more that can be done for the economy, considering our sluggish growth now. I think history will judge the stimulus well, but again that's extremely presumptive. \n\nCivil rights\n\nObama will really only be remembered here as the first black president. I think history will judge him as merely riding a wave of progressive social change, considering that his endorsement of gay marriage was only after Biden fumbled on TV and supported gay marriage, forcing Obama to take a stance. He hasn't really pushed for it or many other civil rights changes, but they happened regardless. Obama also continued many Bush-era policies that restricted civil liberties as part of the Global War on Terror, so again it's largely he did nothing about civil rights.\n\nHealthcare\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, affectionately referred to as Obamacare, has largely not been implemented yet and its effects are still widely presumptive. The health care reform will set a precedent in the future however for a larger government role in health care. \n\nForeign Policy\n\nI think this is where Obama has really shined. A resolution to the Iranian crisis was [on the table in 2010](http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2012/0119/5-reasons-US-must-avoid-war-with-Iran), but other countries in the UN had already added another round of sanctions, killing the deal. He also got [North Korea to stop their nuclear program in exchange for food aid last year](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/world/asia/us-says-north-korea-agrees-to-curb-nuclear-work.html?pagewanted=all), but congress ended it after their unilateral satellite launch. His use of the War Powers Act in Libya is highly controversial and will set a precedent for future executive interventionism (which I don't like, but whatevs).\n\nTL;DR Obama's hallmarks will be the 2009 stimulus and the health care reform.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1d9e63", "selftext": "Our government was set up to operate with one of the most fundamental rights: lobbying. It's explicitly sanctioned in the first amendment \"to petition the Government for a redress of grievances\". It is a form of free speech and is the right to talk with you representative. Banning lobbyism would mean that literally no one is allowed to talk to legislators about legislation, meaning our legislators would simply have no idea what they would be voting on. But on another note, let's look at two scenarios:\n\n1. You have a benevolent legislator, he refuses bribes and acts in the interests of his constituents. Being a good legislator, he doesn't vote on bills without being informed, so he tries to learn about the bills that are coming in. He has to learn about hundreds of bills and thus cant really go in-depth or cover very many of them, he concludes that he needs to get briefs on legislation and talk to experts. Unfortunately, with a lack of staffers, he is **forced** to rely on other sources to be educated. Businesses and lobbying firms outspend the other public-interest groups (they can simply afford more trips to Washington) and get more time to spend with the legislator. The business lobbyists teach the legislator about various policies, using reliable information, however information isnt always clear-cut and the business will usually relay information that is favorable to them. Or a business can simply lobby with misleading information. The legislator, **even a perfect one acting out of completely benevolent interests**, has been colored by big-business and will now make decisions based on the information those businesses have given him. \n\n2. A legislator is corrupt and is willing to take bribes or other contributions. In which case there is nothing that can really be done to fix him, because he already is motivated to use his position to make money. Banning lobbying doesnt solve the problem at all. Backdoor bribery and corruption is still very possible. Even **completely non-traceable** forms of corruption and malice are possible. Let's say a congressman doesn't think he will win reelection or simply desires to retire. Demand for former congressmen to work for businesses is extremely high, because they know the ins and outs of Washington and can abuse their former position. The congressman wants to work for a major oil company, so during his term in office he pushes and supports major subsidies and tax breaks that favor that oil company or even directly contracts them.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Let's begin with a definition of lobbying: \nLobbying is the act of attempting to influence decisions made by officials in the government, most often legislators or members of regulatory agencies. Lobbying is done by many different types of people and organized groups, including individuals in the private sector, corporations, fellow legislators or government officials, or advocacy groups (interest groups). Lobbyists may be among a legislator's constituencies, meaning a voter or bloc of voters within his or her electoral district, or not; they may engage in lobbying as a business, or not. Professional lobbyists are people whose business is trying to influence legislation on behalf of a group or individual who hires them. Individuals and nonprofit organizations can also lobby as an act of volunteering or as a small part of their normal job (for instance, a CEO meeting with a representative about a project important to his/her company, or an activist meeting with his/her legislator in an unpaid capacity). From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying)\n\n\u201cLobbyists are not inherently corrupting, nor does their primary influence stem from some devilish power to automatically compel legislative outcomes through campaign contributions and/or personal connections, as is commonly believed. Rather, their influence comes from their ability to become an essential part of the policymaking process by flooding understaffed, under-experienced, and overworked congressional offices with enough information and expertise to help shape their thinking.\u201d - [Source](http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2011/06/06-lobbying-drutman?rssid=Issues+in+Governance+Studies)\n\nThis is more of a [negative image](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying_in_the_United_States#Negative_image) rather than reality. Yeah, some lobbyists have bribed politicians, but that's not a trait exclusive to lobbyists, nor is it common amongst lobbyists. As the above quote said, the main problem are the legitimate lobbyists - vast majority of them represent business interests and educate legislators about policies.  \n\nIt is ludicrous to directly assert that lobbyism is the problem. The idea is that parties (including citizens, union groups, environmentalists, etc) with a vested interest in legislation should be able to talk to their representative about it. Nothing wrong with that. The only problem is when there are so few staffers that legislators have to rely upon the best lobbyists that only big money can afford. It's an easily fixable problem with solutions that can still retain the benefits of lobbyism.\n\nEssentially, lobbyism is not the problem and attacking lobbyists is a misdirection of the problem, which is an ABUSE of lobbyism or an OVERRELIANCE on lobbyism, which can be solved in a few ways.\n\nCongressional staffers as I outlined in my first post, but another great solution comes from the Brookings report I linked earlier, creating an online database of lobbyists in congress and making it a public forum for legislation. Lobbyists would want to join this to counteract the negative opinion of lobbyists and to respond to other lobbyists claims. Citizens would be able to post their thoughts on legislation to gauge support for legislation. It's also interesting that Brookings partially modelled the proposed website off of Reddit. Their proposal is known as the JAMES system.\n\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1d9e63", "selftext": "I'm fairly certain that post people in the political domain don't use the term \"lobbyist\" to mean the more general definition which you seem to. They use it to mean those people that are the problem: the handymen of large corporations and special interest groups.\n\nYou see, government isn't supposed to operate at the behest of special interest groups. It's not. Congressmen are not supposed to look out for only their constituents or a specific industry. They're supposed to legislate on what's best for the entire nation.\n\nSure, they listen to what people in their districts are saying, but they're not elected purely to go to Washington or the state capital and bring back pork. Although that's how our government has devolved, it's not *supposed* to work that way. They're working from the position of self-interest (as opposed to general interest), and that is when government starts to fall apart.\n\nSo when you say \"lobbyism isn't the problem\" I can only sigh and shake my head. It seems to me that you have a fundamental misunderstanding how our government was set up to operate. And your other post about Congressional staffers is cyclical in its reasoning. Having more highly paid staffers isn't going to keep a Senator from accepting an invitation to the nice steakhouse on the Hill paid for in full by ACME Pharmaceutical's lobbyist.

It's explicitly sanctioned in the first amendment \"to petition the Government for a redress of grievances\". It is a form of free speech and is the right to talk with you representative. Banning lobbyism would mean that literally no one is allowed to talk to legislators about legislation, meaning our legislators would simply have no idea what they would be voting on. But on another note, let's look at two scenarios:\n\n1. You have a benevolent legislator, he refuses bribes and acts in the interests of his constituents. Being a good legislator, he doesn't vote on bills without being informed, so he tries to learn about the bills that are coming in. He has to learn about hundreds of bills and thus cant really go in-depth or cover very many of them, he concludes that he needs to get briefs on legislation and talk to experts. Unfortunately, with a lack of staffers, he is **forced** to rely on other sources to be educated.

Or a business can simply lobby with misleading information. The legislator, **even a perfect one acting out of completely benevolent interests**, has been colored by big-business and will now make decisions based on the information those businesses have given him. \n\n2. A legislator is corrupt and is willing to take bribes or other contributions. In which case there is nothing that can really be done to fix him, because he already is motivated to use his position to make money. Banning lobbying doesnt solve the problem at all. Backdoor bribery and corruption is still very possible. Even **completely non-traceable** forms of corruption and malice are possible. Let's say a congressman doesn't think he will win reelection or simply desires to retire. Demand for former congressmen to work for businesses is extremely high, because they know the ins and outs of Washington and can abuse their former position. The congressman wants to work for a major oil company, so during his term in office he pushes and supports major subsidies and tax breaks that favor that oil company or even directly contracts them. This way his chance of getting a job there is higher after his term ends. \n\nIn both of these scenarios lobbyism is not the problem.

Lobbying is done by many different types of people and organized groups, including individuals in the private sector, corporations, fellow legislators or government officials, or advocacy groups (interest groups). Lobbyists may be among a legislator's constituencies, meaning a voter or bloc of voters within his or her electoral district, or not; they may engage in lobbying as a business, or not. Professional lobbyists are people whose business is trying to influence legislation on behalf of a group or individual who hires them. Individuals and nonprofit organizations can also lobby as an act of volunteering or as a small part of their normal job (for instance, a CEO meeting with a representative about a project important to his/her company, or an activist meeting with his/her legislator in an unpaid capacity). From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying)\n\n\u201cLobbyists are not inherently corrupting, nor does their primary influence stem from some devilish power to automatically compel legislative outcomes through campaign contributions and/or personal connections, as is commonly believed. Rather, their influence comes from their ability to become an essential part of the policymaking process by flooding understaffed, under-experienced, and overworked congressional offices with enough information and expertise to help shape their thinking.\u201d - [Source](http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2011/06/06-lobbying-drutman?rssid=Issues+in+Governance+Studies)\n\nThis is more of a [negative image](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying_in_the_United_States#Negative_image) rather than reality. Yeah, some lobbyists have bribed politicians, but that's not a trait exclusive to lobbyists, nor is it common amongst lobbyists. As the above quote said, the main problem are the legitimate lobbyists - vast majority of them represent business interests and educate legislators about policies.  \n\nIt is ludicrous to directly assert that lobbyism is the problem. The idea is that parties (including citizens, union groups, environmentalists, etc) with a vested interest in legislation should be able to talk to their representative about it. Nothing wrong with that. The only problem is when there are so few staffers that legislators have to rely upon the best lobbyists that only big money can afford. It's an easily fixable problem with solutions that can still retain the benefits of lobbyism.\n\nEssentially, lobbyism is not the problem and attacking lobbyists is a misdirection of the problem, which is an ABUSE of lobbyism or an OVERRELIANCE on lobbyism, which can be solved in a few ways.\n\nCongressional staffers as I outlined in my first post, but another great solution comes from the Brookings report I linked earlier, creating an online database of lobbyists in congress and making it a public forum for legislation. Lobbyists would want to join this to counteract the negative opinion of lobbyists and to respond to other lobbyists claims. Citizens would be able to post their thoughts on legislation to gauge support for legislation. It's also interesting that Brookings partially modelled the proposed website off of Reddit. Their proposal is known as the JAMES system.\n\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1d9e63", "selftext": "I'm fairly certain that post people in the political domain don't use the term \"lobbyist\" to mean the more general definition which you seem to. They use it to mean those people that are the problem: the handymen of large corporations and special interest groups.\n\nYou see, government isn't supposed to operate at the behest of special interest groups. It's not. Congressmen are not supposed to look out for only their constituents or a specific industry. They're supposed to legislate on what's best for the entire nation.\n\nSure, they listen to what people in their districts are saying, but they're not elected purely to go to Washington or the state capital and bring back pork. Although that's how our government has devolved, it's not *supposed* to work that way. They're working from the position of self-interest (as opposed to general interest), and that is when government starts to fall apart.\n\nSo when you say \"lobbyism isn't the problem\" I can only sigh and shake my head. It seems to me that you have a fundamental misunderstanding how our government was set up to operate. And your other post about Congressional staffers is cyclical in its reasoning. Having more highly paid staffers isn't going to keep a Senator from accepting an invitation to the nice steakhouse on the Hill paid for in full by ACME Pharmaceutical's lobbyist. Congresspeople don't accept lavish gifts or \"constituent visits\" from people because they don't have time to learn about it themselves or through their staffers; they accept those calls and visits because they think they can get something out of it.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1d9e63", "selftext": "Our government was set up to operate with one of the most fundamental rights: lobbying. It's explicitly sanctioned in the first amendment \"to petition the Government for a redress of grievances\". It is a form of free speech and is the right to talk with you representative. Banning lobbyism would mean that literally no one is allowed to talk to legislators about legislation, meaning our legislators would simply have no idea what they would be voting on. But on another note, let's look at two scenarios:\n\n1. You have a benevolent legislator, he refuses bribes and acts in the interests of his constituents. Being a good legislator, he doesn't vote on bills without being informed, so he tries to learn about the bills that are coming in. He has to learn about hundreds of bills and thus cant really go in-depth or cover very many of them, he concludes that he needs to get briefs on legislation and talk to experts. Unfortunately, with a lack of staffers, he is **forced** to rely on other sources to be educated. Businesses and lobbying firms outspend the other public-interest groups (they can simply afford more trips to Washington) and get more time to spend with the legislator. The business lobbyists teach the legislator about various policies, using reliable information, however information isnt always clear-cut and the business will usually relay information that is favorable to them. Or a business can simply lobby with misleading information. The legislator, **even a perfect one acting out of completely benevolent interests**, has been colored by big-business and will now make decisions based on the information those businesses have given him. \n\n2. A legislator is corrupt and is willing to take bribes or other contributions. In which case there is nothing that can really be done to fix him, because he already is motivated to use his position to make money. Banning lobbying doesnt solve the problem at all. Backdoor bribery and corruption is still very possible. Even **completely non-traceable** forms of corruption and malice are possible. Let's say a congressman doesn't think he will win reelection or simply desires to retire. Demand for former congressmen to work for businesses is extremely high, because they know the ins and outs of Washington and can abuse their former position. The congressman wants to work for a major oil company, so during his term in office he pushes and supports major subsidies and tax breaks that favor that oil company or even directly contracts them. This way his chance of getting a job there is higher after his term ends. \n\nIn both of these scenarios lobbyism is not the problem. You seem to think that many of our legislators are corrupt and thus under the second scenario it is **IMPOSSIBLE** to stop them, even if lobbying was banned. In the first scenario, even with a completely benevolent congressman, lobbying isnt the problem, it's the fact that there are no staffers and that business lobbies can outspend the other lobbies. \n\nLobbying as a problem is a **critical misdirection** that prevents us from addressing the **real** problems, big business, a critically understaffed congress, and corruption.\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Chipzzz", "id": "t1_c9okpyw", "parent_id": "t1_c9oir0x", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431391407, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thank you for the thoughtful thorough response, and that was quite a nimble slight of mind in substituting \"persuasion\" for \"money\" and bringing us only a hairbreadth from \"speech\".

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1d189p", "selftext": "Lobbyism is critical to the democratic process.\n\nLobbyism is NOT bribing politicians, it is seeking to influence a legislator. In today's times, with mushrooming bureaucracy, increased complexity of legislation, and legislation becoming more and more technical and arcane it is impossible for a legislator to be properly informed on the legislation that they vote on. This is why legislators have staffers and lobbyists to help them out. Lobbyists merely inform legislators, though there can be problems with bias.\n\nIt's important to note that lobbyism isn't the problem, lobbyism is critical for organizations and individuals to be able to voice their concerns and directly communicate with their representatives. But the problem is that large businesses control much of the lobbyism process, which crowds out public interest groups. How big of a problem is this? Business lobbies outnumber public interest (environment, citizen, union) lobbies on a 16:1 ratio. Additionally, business lobbies make up over 75% of all lobbying spending. \n\nI think the best solution to this along with drastically improving the efficiency of government is to \n\n1. Provide pay increase to congressional staffers\n2. Hire many more staffers.\n3. Fund congressional offices\n\nThis solves lobbyism in three ways.\n\nFirst, it directly reduces the number of lobbyists. Around 90% of congressional staffers leave their jobs and eventually become lobbyists. More than half quit within three years. This means remaining staffers are overworked and have to work 80-100 hour work weeks. They are also only paid $30,000 a year, compared to a multiple hundred thousand dollar salary available at a lobbying firm. Thirty thousand dollars is compared to congressional parking-lot attendees who make $49,000 a year. \n\nOver the years less and less money has been allocated to the staffers while bureaucracy has mushroomed, dramatically increasing the workload of these staffers.\n\nBecause of poor job quality, congressional staffers are by-and-large 24 year old college grads with no prior job experience and have little outside knowledge, which when compared to a lobbyist who has decades of experience with a specific industry or sector, no wonder politicians rely on lobbyists. This leads to\n\nSecond, it indirectly reduces the number of lobbyists. More staffers means congressmen need less lobbyists to fill their positions. Higher wage means these staffers will stay more frequently, allowing their experience to go on par with lobbyists.\n\nThirdly, it allows unregistered and illegal lobbyists to be prosecuted. The DoJ has referred over 2000 cases of unregistered lobbyists to the Clerk of the House, but because of the staffing crisis, they simply weren't able to prosecute any of these individuals. The Brookings Institute estimates that ~9% of lobbyists are improperly registered. Basically there are just so many high-stress jobs that these staffers have to do and they physically cant with their resources.\n\nWhat do staffers mean? Positions like congressional aides and assistants. More people to work in places like the Congressional Research Service or the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nI think this is the most important solution to lobbyism.

Congressperson much constantly seek lobbyist so as to have enough fund to win the election cycle and in particular have a war chest large enough to fight any potential smear campaign. Congresspersons spend an enormous amount of their time, I think something like 70%+, fundraising. Additionally congresspersons can be coerced into voting or not voting on a bill out of fear of being the target of a smear campaign. \n\nSo while I'm not arguing against your proposals, and indeed they really do solve some problems, the core issue \"threatening our democracy\" would be to reform campaign financing. Not only limiting how much and from where a politician can bring in money (directly and indirectly). But indeed limiting how much money can spent for political purposes during an election cycle/campaign. Of course it is easier said than done. While it may feel good to say campaigns can only be public financed and to block all third party advertising, it would also to a very real extent suppress the ability for the public to participate in the political process. \n\nSources for the campaign finance stuff I brought up:\n\nhttp://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/461/take-the-money-and-run-for-office\n\nhttp://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/01/27/145923803/the-friday-podcast-a-former-lobbyist-tells-all", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Scaryclouds", "id": "t1_c9mx2xe", "parent_id": "t1_c9lwvfk", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431423891, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1d189p", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9mx2xe", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366952597", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "How about simply reduce the scope of government?

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "There are a few reasons why the US military budget is so exorbitantly high and why it is difficult to lower.\n\nFirst and foremost are the objectives the US is trying to achieve. As the world's first hyperpower, the US is attempting to maintain its hegemony by projecting global power. This is part of the doctrine of a global strike force and being able to attack any part of the world within 30 mins of an order. The United States is employing this to secure its position as the only superpower, ensuring security for allies and attempting to keep peace around the world, or if necessary, employ force to accomplish other US objectives. This is part of the hard power / soft power theory of international relations. Soft power is when countries want to be like the US and they like us so they naturally align themselves with our interests. Hard power is when we use military to coerce, provide security, or just establish dominance to force states to align with us to be associated with our military power.\n\nSecond is the post-9/11 security environment. After 9/11, lawmakers were forced to center their foreign policy around terrorism, a threat that is notoriously difficult to eradicate. The emotional impact of 9/11 forced these legislators to allocate a disproportionate amount of funds to accomplish counterterrorism for both a fear of looking weak on terrorism and to compensate for the huge impact 9/11 was to the US. Military spending after 9/11 mushroomed from $300 bil/year to $900 bil/year. The problem though is that terrorism is difficult to solve, especially through military usage, so this has resulted in expensive military operations in Afghanistan and around the world as part of the Global War on Terror, employing thousands of troops to hunt down enemies. This also justified a policy of preemptive intervention and conflict. After 9/11, we realized all the signs had been before us and it was a failure to act that allowed the WTC towers to fall. This created pretense for expensive TSA scanners, domestic police operations, the Iraq conflict, and is creating a pretense for an Iran strike now. The US is now in a lose-lose situation with terrorism, current operations are extremely expensive in terms of blood and treasure and aren't really making too much of an impact on the forces of terrorism. So if we stop spending, we will look weak in the face of terrorism, not accomplishing many objectives in recent years and may weaken America's reputation, because we had already built up so much momentum to support the Global War on Terror, that the international community is so steadfast in our prior convictions, that each country is afraid of being critical of the Global War on Terror for fear of a loss of diplomatic credibility or simply reputation. If the US continues operations though, spending will continue to constrain US budgets, lives will be lost, more terrorist forces could be recruited in reaction to a perceived imperialist foreign policy, and the US will look weak for failing to stamp out some of the weakest enemies we have ever faced. \n\nThird, is that the massive military expenditures have funded an entire industry of constituents who fear for their job. Expensive military development boondoggles are almost never put on the chopping bucket, because these projects create hundreds of jobs. Massive production to support the military directly provides various industries with employment. \n\nFourth, is the economy. The Diversionary theory of foreign policy argues that democracies are more likely to employ their military when the economy (or generally popularity) is low in order to shift focus away from domestic problems and cause the country to rally around the flag in a foreign conflict. This is why Bush possessed the highest popularity rating immediately after 9/11 and is why before elections we tend to see conflict or a refusal to engage in peace. Nixon told South Vietnam to refuse to negotiate peace terms until after he was elected, Bush started the Iraq war a year before the 2004 elections, Obama employed military action against Libya in 2011, and he was forced to appeal to Israeli voters by stating that a military option against Iran was on the table.

Basically, districts are divided equally mathematically to totally eliminate political bias in determining districts.\n\nIt's important to note that lobbyism isn't the problem, lobbyism is critical for organizations and individuals to be able to voice their concerns and directly communicate with their representatives. But the problem is that large businesses control much of the lobbyism process, which crowds out public interest groups. How big of a problem is this? Business lobbies outnumber public interest (environment, citizen, union) lobbies on a 16:1 ratio. Additionally, business lobbies make up over 75% of all lobbying spending. \n\nI think the best solution to this along with drastically improving the efficiency of government is to \n\n1. Provide pay increase to congressional staffers\n2. Hire many more staffers.\n3. Fund congressional offices\n\nThis solves lobbyism in three ways.\n\nFirst, it directly reduces the number of lobbyists. Around 90% of congressional staffers leave their jobs and eventually become lobbyists. More than half quit within three years. This means remaining staffers are overworked and have to work 80-100 hour work weeks. They are also only paid $30,000 a year, compared to a multiple hundred thousand dollar salary available at a lobbying firm. Thirty thousand dollars is compared to congressional parking-lot attendees who make $49,000 a year. \n\nOver the years less and less money has been allocated to the staffers while bureaucracy has mushroomed, dramatically increasing the workload of these staffers.\n\nBecause of poor job quality, congressional staffers are by-and-large 24 year old college grads with no prior job experience and have little outside knowledge, which when compared to a lobbyist who has decades of experience with a specific industry or sector, no wonder politicians rely on lobbyists. This leads to\n\nSecond, it indirectly reduces the number of lobbyists. More staffers means congressmen need less lobbyists to fill their positions. Higher wage means these staffers will stay more frequently, allowing their experience to go on par with lobbyists.\n\nThirdly, it allows unregistered and illegal lobbyists to be prosecuted. The DoJ has referred over 2000 cases of unregistered lobbyists to the Clerk of the House, but because of the staffing crisis, they simply weren't able to prosecute any of these individuals. The Brookings Institute estimates that ~9% of lobbyists are improperly registered. Basically there are just so many high-stress jobs that these staffers have to do and they physically cant with their resources.\n\nWhat do staffers mean? Positions like congressional aides and assistants. More people to work in places like the Congressional Research Service or the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nI think this is the most important solution to lobbyism.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I think much of the post-9/11 security measures are largely reactionary and not preventative. This means they will be largely ineffective against terrorism, because terrorists are highly adaptive forces. Say we tighten airport security, then they will use a freighter with a bomb on it, derail a passenger train, etc. \n\nSpecifically, on airport security, there is [no evidence that the TSA has prevented a single attack.](http://www.policymic.com/articles/3590/rand-paul-airport-pat-down-shows-how-tsa-security-measures-harm-our-health-privacy-and-dignity) \n\nBut more importantly, [this](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/66186/john-mueller-and-mark-g-stewart/hardly-existential) is a great article on one particular reason why the responsible course of action is to do nothing to combat or prevent terrorism. \n\nIt basically says that there are multiple precedents on what constitutes an unacceptable and an acceptable risk. The SCOTUS in 1980 as part of the Benzene decision ruled that a fatality rate of 1 in 40,000 would be unacceptable. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ruled that fatalities should not exceed 1 in a million. A review of 132 regulatory actions found that action always occurred after a fatality rate of 1 in 700,000 occurred. Using the population of the US, in order for federal action to be responsible, the fatality risk must exceed ~314 deaths per year. \n\nThis is so the government doesnt waste funds on combating safety risks found in home appliances, which kills 200 people per year.\n\nTerrorism doesn't come even near the threshold for government action to be responsible. Americans are twice as likely to die from lightning and several thousand times more likely to die in some sort of accident. In order to reach an actionable range of deaths, terrorism would need to kill more than 35 times its current count.\n\nOne may say, doesn't every life count? As long as we save lives it's worth it right? The problem is that the government has very limited resources and funds to be distributed to combat all sorts of risks. A dollar going to fight terrorism is a dollar not going to improving health care, workplace safety, or other bigger threats. Substantially more lives could have been saved if money spent on these security measures was spent elsewhere. \n\nThis is precisely why it's the government's responsibility NOT to act in the face of terrorism. We are losing lives and treasure combating a non-problem, these lives and funds could be allocated to saving many more lives.

And voters are humans. A politician suggesting that kind of policy would be committing electoral suicide. Psychologically, a death resulting from a car accident is very different from a murder, especially if the murder is perpetrated with political motivations. \n\nAdditionally, those numbers are skewed by the fact that the government allocates resources to anti-terrorism measures. If the government suddenly stopped spending money in security measures. \n\nFinally, I'm not sure there's a good reason for the government to intervene in situations where there is no infringement on anyone's rights. I'm fine with the state using its monopoly of force to protect individuals from aggression, not so much with using to protect individuals from the outcomes of their own voluntary decisions or bad genes. \n\nIn any case, that doesn't really answer OP's question.

I answer that they are not, because even assuming max effectiveness, they fall below the actionable threshold. \n\nSecond, the psychological impact is already accounted for, the article I linked states that the Pentagon considers death associated with terrorism to be twice as important as a death from any other threat, because of the psychological impact. Though you are right that this is not a popular opinion, I affirm that this SHOULD be the responsibility of the government.\n\nLastly, in response to your statement that the numbers are skewed by the money we are already spending, the article states:\n\n&gt; Those who\nthink that counterterrorism measures are the reason for the low terrorism risk\nneed to demonstrate that such efforts have deterred, derailed, or disrupted\nattacks that would otherwise have resulted in the deaths of more than 3,000\npeople in the United States every year. Only in that case would terrorism begin\nto present a risk deemed \"unacceptable\" by conventional standards. But even if all the (mostly embryonic) terrorist plots exposed since 9/11 had\nbeen successfully carried out, their likely consequences would have been far less\nsevere. Indeed, both before and after 2001, the total number of people killed\nby terrorists outside (and sometimes within) war zones generally registers far\nbelow that number.

It's a rather straightforward inquiry on facts: were any terrorist attacks prevented by those measures or not.\n\nAs for your second point, I find that weight way too low, but I'd need to see how the Pentagon arrived to that number so I'll abstain from commenting.\n\nAs for the third point: a) the difference between pre and post 9/11 is only on the margin, as resources were already allocated to counter terrorism before 2001; b) the level of terrorism threat is dynamic.

Terrorism has become the focal point of US foreign policy with our society now prepared against the threat of terrorism. It would be reasonable to suggest that with the massive shift in resources and focus dedicated to fighting terrorism there would be an appreciable drop in terror fatalities. \n\nB. But even when the IRA was active they failed to reach the UK's threshold for actionable fatalities. The IRA conflict was responsible for ~57 deaths per year, given the UK population, it would have to be 63 deaths per year.

So regardless if they did answered my title question exactly or not, I like them all as they provide an important insight on the topic. I actually agree with most of you guys, if not all. This is a very extensive issue which might be looked at from different vantage points. I personally use to think that such security measures as implemented for example at the airports are actually kind of useful, at least here in the UK I personally never had any kind of problem when coming through a security. Also the same in the US. That is however just a drop in the sea and there is a lot of invisible things which might not appear existent on the first look but when one actually starts to do some research they can realize that there is a lot to be concerned about. I am not particularly familiar with the US Patriot Act but I have heard a lot of academic and non-academic critique on the this legislative. The question is: is it actually worth to try to fight terrorists who probably aim to scare the population in a manner that might result in actions in which the government enforces and uses the containing power against its own citizens, therefore terrorizes its own citizens as well?

The Crime of Aggression (although note that this is the most contentious of the 'international crimes').\n\nFurthermore, the founding statutes also strictly confine the temporal and territorial jurisdiction of those tribunals - especially in the case of the ICTY and ICTR as they were set up in response to humanitarian conflicts/disasters. The ICC is limited to the 139 states that have ratified the Rome Treaty.\n\nOther international courts or tribunals - for example, the International Court of Justice - are restricted to nation states. As it currently stands, the individual has no place in those tribunals. \n\nThe likelihood is that if the moon was destroyed by someone, the international community and/or the United Nations and/or the Security Council would form a tribunal specifically with the intention of prosecuting that person.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9k39bx", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366606883", "distinguished": null, "ups": 3}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "BearJuden113", "id": "t1_c9jvgcj", "parent_id": "t1_c9jv0ls", "score": 26, "retrieved_on": 1431476621, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Can the UN prosecute someone?

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1c5asf", "selftext": "I think most people are underestimating both the size of the North Korean artillery forces and the chaos that would take place in the event of a war. It's also important to note that when people use the terms flatten or destroy, they aren't saying the entire city of Seoul is going to literally be destroyed, but more so the number of deaths would be so incredibly devastating. \n\nFirst, North Korea [has the largest artillery force in the world](http://www.businessinsider.com/map-of-the-day-how-north-korea-could-destroy-seoul-in-two-hours-2010-5?op=1), with an estimated 8000 highly-mobile artillery pieces. The article mentions the destruction of Seoul in two hours, but I'm not sure what the basis of that is, TIME estimates that North Korea could do it in [half an hour](http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,446776,00.html)\n\nSecond, the number of deaths from artillery is empirically extremely high. Estimates deaths from artillery during WWII are [over half of the total deaths,](http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Artillery_deaths_World_war_2) and that's including the Pacific Theatre, where artillery was sparsely used. It's important to note that Seoul is also the most population-dense city amongst the OECD developed nations, this will make artillery even more effective. Additionally, much of the population lives in [hastily constructed apartments](http://www.wfs.org/Jan-Feb%2009/Gov.htm), which would increase the likelihood of collapsing buildings and generating shrapnel.  \n\nThird, North Korean artillery would have a lot of time to fire before allied forces target the artillery pieces. North Korea's military strategy is largely planned around [a massive invasion of South Korea,](http://www.iiss.org/publications/strategic-dossiers/north-korean-dossier/north-koreas-weapons-programmes-a-net-asses/the-conventional-military-balance-on-the-kore/) with the vast majority of their forces concentrated along the border. North Korea also has the largest armed forces, with just under [9.5 million.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_People's_Army) This means that Allied forces would prioritize [immediate damage control](http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/aviation/military/this-is-what-air-war-over-korea-would-look-like-15293363), targeting the flood of North Korean troops and tanks. This in addition to the fact that North Korean artillery is mobile and could be difficult to detect, means that our air forces would focus on taking out the invading forces and their command structure. \n\nThe allied forces would stomp North Korea if political considerations were set aside, but with the 10.5 million people in Seoul on the line and the possible breakout of chemical, biological, or nuclear war North Korean forces may be able to force a favorable ceasefire.\n\nSouth Korea recently elected a new president; I think part of the motivation towards all the aggressive rhetoric is that Kim Jong-Un is testing the boundaries of the new government, to see what he can get away with during her administration.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "For one, that comment is moreso directed against the rhetoric that say that North Korea is going to \"level Seoul\", undoubtedly Seoul will still be standing, but with significant damage as he says.\n\nAdditionally, while he does look at the ranges of a few rocket and artillery pieces, he doesn't really analyze the whole conventional arsenal of the North Korean military.

Sorry Gettin_Slizzard, your job makes no difference!!\n\nWhile it is true in the case of taxation that the money must first be taken out of the economy and therefore the stimulative effect will be reduced, it's important to note the goals of stimulus.\n\nBorrowing does not suffer from the same problems, but more of that later. \n\nIt is to create new consumers so the private sector will hire more employees to service these consumers.\n\n&gt; money that is simply printed and put into the economy does not change the world's accumulated wealth...it neither increases it nor decreases it. Because the world's wealth has not increased by the extra $75k the government has put into the economy, we have to ask what happened to it? Well, everyone who holds dollars finds out that their dollars are not worth as much as yesterday. Gettin_Slizzard's salary has come from the inflation of the dollar. This inflation means that everybody has less purchasing power...and cannot spend as much in the value chain of wealth creation\n\nThis isn't exactly true. Inflation is the rise in price for goods and services, for one thing if the gov printed $75k to pay for my job, it would be imperceptible by markets as a share of the total money supply. If the money supply is $1.18 tr, businesses simply cannot charge .000063% more for goods and services. It is ludicrous.\n\nAlso, [this](http://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2011/05/14/money-growth-does-not-cause-inflation/) article is great at explaining the cause of inflation. \n\n&gt; Their final option is to borrow some money from another country and use that to pay Gettin_Slizzard. So the American bankers jump on a plane and fly to China and tell the Chinese...lend us $75k to pay Gettin_Slizzard, and next year we will you back $80k, ok? The Chinese like this deal....after all, with the full faith and credit of the United States Government, a mere $75k loan is very easy to do.\nSo, the Bankers come back with $75k in fresh US $100 bills stuffing their pockets and give that to Gettin_Slizzard for his valuable work at the EPA.\nGettin_Slizzard spends that money in exactly the same way as Nonknower. But the economy doesn't change...why? Because the mere borrowing of money does not create new wealth. The inflow of the $75k from China has created exactly the same inflation as if the money had simply been printed in the first place.\nSo...the problem is that this is no different than the impact of printing money. Simply a circulation of capital!\nBut it becomes more distressing..\nAmerica has to pay China back...and since the government has no money of its own, it has three choices. Raise taxes, print money, or borrow money.\nCan you see a pattern developing? When we borrow money to pay Gettin_Slizzard, we find ourselves in a never ending cycle of higher taxes, inflation and growing debt. This unsound economic structure will eventually come crashing down.\n\nFirst, the vast majority of borrowed money comes from US citizens, which means they weren't investing that money in the first place. Though, there is a possibility of a crowd-out effect, it rarely overwhelms the stimulative effect of borrowed stimulus.\n\nSecond, it is not inflation, because it is a method of creating wealth without printing any money. It is an exchange of spending now for spending later. \n\nThirdly, this assumes positive interest rates. While this is normally the case, we have [recently](http://www.epi.org/blog/infrastructure-benefits/) seen a very interesting scenario where interest rates were negative, meaning that markets were willing to pay the government to spend money.\n\nFourthly, stimulus-funded employees ARE NOT PERMANENT. Using this example, let's say a stimulus project funds a construction company using borrowed money to be paid back in 5 years. The worker is directed to make improvements to a highly congested highway. The construction company is desperate for work and begins construction. It pays its employees and they spend that money in the economy, that money then gets spent and spent and spent. A local restaurant see that all these construction workers have money to spend, so they hire new employees to service the workers. These new employees then cause other businesses in the area to hire more and etc. The construction company purchased its supplies from a local steel mill, which hires new employees and productive capacity to supply the construction company. These employees contribute to the cyclical growth. When the government creates new consumers, it helps business.\n\nConstruction is finished in a year and the government ends the contract. The restaurant we saw earlier is booming, because of the new consumers and hires the construction company from earlier to increase the capacity of the restaurant. This is when economic growth becomes entirely independent of the government.\n\nThe new jobs means more people are paying taxes and the initial borrowed money to pay for the construction contract is paid off with interest, meaning all parties gained money and profited. This also means no one is trapped in a debt cycle.\n\nMeanwhile the newly improved road does not require future repair work and means the government has to spend less money on repairing the bridge. The less congested road allows for easier access to the restaurant and new customers allows it to flourish. The steel mill now has to pay less gas to bypass the congested highway and can afford to increased its productive capacity. Less congestion means the citizens are wasting less time in traffic and more time working in the economy. A particular pothole on the highway was repaired, meaning the local people no longer have to waste their precious paychecks fixing their vehicles that were damaged by the shotty roadwork that was present before. The new road makes the town more attractive and boosts local property values increasing the retail sector. The less congested road also contributes less to air pollution, saving health care costs, helping the local farmer, and making the people happier, further boosting property values.\n\nThe temporary spending by the government funded a prosperous and permanent growth in the economy. The debts were paid off and the people are happy, healthy, and well off.\n\n\nNow, let me ask you a single question. What can a dying private business do if there are no consumers?", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "selftext": "&gt; If a business does not have sufficient demand for its services or products, they will no longer be able to survive as a viable enterprise.

What can a dying private business do if there are no consumers? \n\n   --If a business does not have sufficient demand for its services or products, they will no longer be able to survive as a viable enterprise.

Please note I did not say no regulation.\n\nQuite often, a supposition will look good as an essay, but fundamentally fizzles in the real world. However, Keynesian economics is not one of those suppositions. It falls short both in theory and in real life.I was hoping to avoid the following little synopsis as it can get confusing and a little boring as well. But you have proven yourself a quite worthy opponent and I am running out of responses. Here it is:\n\nKeynes states that the Gross Domestic Product is equal to Consumption plus Investment plus Government Spending plus Net Exports (GDP=C+I+G+NX). So he assumes that if you increase any variable in the equation, the GDP will grow correspondingly. This is what his entire conclusions are centered on.  However, he routinely disregards the fact that plainly transferring wealth is not creating wealth, but rather just apportions it in another way. I will cite some illustrations of this sophistry.\nFirst, envision this: So in order to increase Government Spending (G), you have to increase taxes. Increasing taxes adds value to the variable  Taxes (T). Increasing Taxes means that Consumption (C) will decrease. That is inescapable\nSo the increase in G is offset by the decrease in C due to higher taxes. The GDP doesn\u2019t expand, it is just proportioned differently. A decrease in T (Taxes) has more of an effect on the economy than increasing G (Government spending) Why? Because consumers will only consume what they demand. We decide what has value. If we decide that iPhone 5\u2019s are more important to us than a parking ramp, iPhone 5\u2019s have more value. That\u2019s because only the consumers can choose what has value by demanding it.\nSo when G is increased, production may increase, but not necessarily production of something we demand. For example, if government spending is increased to pay for a parking ramp in the middle of a potato farm, is that good? No, because something was produced which has no value because it\u2019s not in demand. So government spending takes from consumers (the only people that can give value to something), and spends it on things which may not have value.\nEnvision this: According to this logic, shouldn\u2019t the government hire people to run around and damage things? If that was done, the government could spend the money to repair these things. It\u2019s an increase in G and also gives jobs to people. So shouldn\u2019t Keynes want that?\nOf course, the problem is that nothing was created with value. So it did not expand our wealth.\nAll sorts of issues arise when employment becomes an objective rather than a result. Keynesian economics is in large part a theory dedicated to fight unemployment. Since this is the case, all Keynesians are opposed to all technological advancements that make us more productive and successful, right? Of course, not, that would be absurd. But it would be entirely consistent for Keynesians to maintain that viewpoint.\nAnother thing to understand, is that an increase in C (Consumption) is not intrinsically good. This is especially true when NX (Net Exports) decreases when C is increased.\nFor example, if our nation imports 90% of its goods and services, our Net Exports (NX) will be negative, subtracting from our GDP. So what happens if our C increases by 50%? The -NX will increase enormously. So when we have a deficit in NX, when our C increases, the increase in C is offset by the decrease in NX.\nYou mentioned Keynes concept known as the \u201cMultiplier\u201d. The concept states that government spending is a more powerful tool of economic growth than letting the market consume. Assume that every consumer spends $0.75 out of every $1.00 they make. Keynes says that if the government spends $1,000,000 to \u201cstimulate\u201d the economy, you multiply it by a specific number. Let\u2019s say the multiplier is 4. So you multiply the government spending by whatever your multipler is. So in this case, it would be 4 x $1,000,000=$4,000,000. And POOF! That money taken from taxpayers just quadrupled.\nOf course, if you actually think this through, it\u2019s a ridiculous concept. As I mentioned before, the only way value can be added to a product, is through consumer demand, which only the consumers can decide. So when the government consumes, it is taking our money, and spending it on things not necessarily in demand. Since insignificant things are often produced, there is no growth. The only change, is that the consumer who add value to products, have less spending power because the government has taken it and spent it elsewhere.\nThe entire concept of a multiplier is a joke, yet admittedly it is still has a large following with the abundant left leaning economists that promulgate our universities.\nOur economic woes will continue if we do not forsake the ethos that the government can solve the economy by interfering and printing and/or borrowing money. \nOne last comment. You still have not been able to produce a clear cut example of a positive outcome for the Keynesian method. I hope you do not subscribe to the 2009 stimulus as a success.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "selftext": "&gt; You believe an active government is the catalyst in propelling the economy. The government should step in and pass legislation to encourage employment. My feelings are that government (for the most part) needs to get out of the way in order for the private sector to create jobs.\n\nThis is a misrepresentation of what I believe. I believe, backed by strong evidence, that there are scenarios where the private sector is risk-adverse to hiring new employees and boosting productivity. I think the government's role in the economy at this point is to get the private sector to hire again. This can happen through either supply or demand. If supply is the problem, then the company is short on cash to hire more people and corporate tax cuts, loans, cash infusions, etc would allow the company to hire more people. \n\nIf demand is the problem, then the problem is that there are not enough consumers. This cannot be fixed independently by the private sector. At this point it is the government's responsibility to directly hire employees who will become consumers of private sector goods, allowing the private sector to flourish.\n\n&gt;Let's contrast this with Gettin_Slizzard who holds a government job as a technician in a computer center. Gettin_Slizzard works just as hard as Nonknower, and actually does a valuable job, keeping the EPA computers safe from viruses. He doesn't actually create anything, and he is not part of a chain that produces a product that is sold to the private sector, but he does keep the EPA computers running smoothly.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, does not create any products that can be sold to the private sector either, but they do create regulations and employ an awful lot of people to support those regulations. There are many Gettin_Slizzard's, thus keeping unemployment down. After all, without the EPA creating precepts, Gettin_Slizzard would not have a job...but here he is earning his $75k salary, and not collecting unemployment.\n\nThis is misleading for a few reasons\n\nFirst, the EPA's purpose is NOT an economic one, but an environmental one. It's goal is NOT to provide employment, but to protect the environment. \n\nSecond, I do not support regulatory action as stimulus. Of course it doesnt boost the economy.\n\nThirdly, the EPA does provide a service that benefits the economy. The EPA is part of a critical economic chain. It provides environmental capital. While overregulation can be a problem, it is wrong to completely dismiss certain economic benefits of SOME regulation. Pollution may degrade air quality and drain the economy because of increased health care spending or declining agricultural productivity. Overfishing provides short-run economic benefits, but dooms ocean ecosystems in the long-run, which even from a purely economic perspective is bad. This ignores direct harm to the public.  \n \nLet's look at a more tangible public service that is less abstract than the EPA and has a more direct impact on the economy. Building of infrastructure is something that the private sector rarely does, because of its high initial capital costs. But free and accessible public transportation and electricity systems provided by the government reduce the costs of operating a business. They also provide for the public good.\n\nIn the case of infrastructure, even assuming it was completely funded by taxes, it is best for the economy in the long-term, because it decreases the cost of living, operating businesses, etc.\n\nThe government has a purpose other than promoting the economy. Promoting the well-being of its citizens by protecting the health and security of them. These must be weighed against potential economic effects. \n\n&gt;So...the fact that Gettin_Slizzard spends his salary on the value chain is not an argument since if Gettin_Slizzard did not have that job, you and I could spend that exact same amount of money on the value chain that creates wealth.\n\nWell actually, this is a concept known as the multiplier effect and it applies to both private and public sector spending.\n\n\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "selftext": "&gt;Gettin_Slizzard's salary as a government worker is nothing more than a \"circulation of capital\"....the government takes it from us and gives it to Gettin_Slizzard so he can spend it....it is the same money, just circulated in a different way.\nIf Gettin_Slizzard's job is paid for through taxation, it has zero effect on the economy. Sorry Gettin_Slizzard, your job makes no difference!!\n\nWhile it is true in the case of taxation that the money must first be taken out of the economy and therefore the stimulative effect will be reduced, it's important to note the goals of stimulus.\n\nBorrowing does not suffer from the same problems, but more of that later. \n\nIt is to create new consumers so the private sector will hire more employees to service these consumers.\n\n&gt; money that is simply printed and put into the economy does not change the world's accumulated wealth...it neither increases it nor decreases it. Because the world's wealth has not increased by the extra $75k the government has put into the economy, we have to ask what happened to it? Well, everyone who holds dollars finds out that their dollars are not worth as much as yesterday. Gettin_Slizzard's salary has come from the inflation of the dollar. This inflation means that everybody has less purchasing power...and cannot spend as much in the value chain of wealth creation\n\nThis isn't exactly true. Inflation is the rise in price for goods and services, for one thing if the gov printed $75k to pay for my job, it would be imperceptible by markets as a share of the total money supply. If the money supply is $1.18 tr, businesses simply cannot charge .000063% more for goods and services. It is ludicrous.\n\nAlso, [this](http://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2011/05/14/money-growth-does-not-cause-inflation/) article is great at explaining the cause of inflation. \n\n&gt; Their final option is to borrow some money from another country and use that to pay Gettin_Slizzard. So the American bankers jump on a plane and fly to China and tell the Chinese...lend us $75k to pay Gettin_Slizzard, and next year we will you back $80k, ok? The Chinese like this deal....after all, with the full faith and credit of the United States Government, a mere $75k loan is very easy to do.\nSo, the Bankers come back with $75k in fresh US $100 bills stuffing their pockets and give that to Gettin_Slizzard for his valuable work at the EPA.\nGettin_Slizzard spends that money in exactly the same way as Nonknower. But the economy doesn't change...why? Because the mere borrowing of money does not create new wealth. The inflow of the $75k from China has created exactly the same inflation as if the money had simply been printed in the first place.\nSo...the problem is that this is no different than the impact of printing money. Simply a circulation of capital!\nBut it becomes more distressing..\nAmerica has to pay China back...and since the government has no money of its own, it has three choices. Raise taxes, print money, or borrow money.\nCan you see a pattern developing? When we borrow money to pay Gettin_Slizzard, we find ourselves in a never ending cycle of higher taxes, inflation and growing debt. This unsound economic structure will eventually come crashing down.\n\nFirst, the vast majority of borrowed money comes from US citizens, which means they weren't investing that money in the first place. Though, there is a possibility of a crowd-out effect, it rarely overwhelms the stimulative effect of borrowed stimulus.\n\nSecond, it is not inflation, because it is a method of creating wealth without printing any money. It is an exchange of spending now for spending later. \n\nThirdly, this assumes positive interest rates. While this is normally the case, we have [recently](http://www.epi.org/blog/infrastructure-benefits/) seen a very interesting scenario where interest rates were negative, meaning that markets were willing to pay the government to spend money.\n\nFourthly, stimulus-funded employees ARE NOT PERMANENT. Using this example, let's say a stimulus project funds a construction company using borrowed money to be paid back in 5 years. The worker is directed to make improvements to a highly congested highway. The construction company is desperate for work and begins construction. It pays its employees and they spend that money in the economy, that money then gets spent and spent and spent. A local restaurant see that all these construction workers have money to spend, so they hire new employees to service the workers. These new employees then cause other businesses in the area to hire more and etc. The construction company purchased its supplies from a local steel mill, which hires new employees and productive capacity to supply the construction company. These employees contribute to the cyclical growth. When the government creates new consumers, it helps business.\n\nConstruction is finished in a year and the government ends the contract. The restaurant we saw earlier is booming, because of the new consumers and hires the construction company from earlier to increase the capacity of the restaurant. This is when economic growth becomes entirely independent of the government.\n\nThe new jobs means more people are paying taxes and the initial borrowed money to pay for the construction contract is paid off with interest, meaning all parties gained money and profited. This also means no one is trapped in a debt cycle.\n\nMeanwhile the newly improved road does not require future repair work and means the government has to spend less money on repairing the bridge. The less congested road allows for easier access to the restaurant and new customers allows it to flourish. The steel mill now has to pay less gas to bypass the congested highway and can afford to increased its productive capacity. Less congestion means the citizens are wasting less time in traffic and more time working in the economy. A particular pothole on the highway was repaired, meaning the local people no longer have to waste their precious paychecks fixing their vehicles that were damaged by the shotty roadwork that was present before. The new road makes the town more attractive and boosts local property values increasing the retail sector. The less congested road also contributes less to air pollution, saving health care costs, helping the local farmer, and making the people happier, further boosting property values.\n\nThe temporary spending by the government funded a prosperous and permanent growth in the economy. The debts were paid off and the people are happy, healthy, and well off.\n\n\nNow, let me ask you a single question.

An article I cited in the post I cited before shows that business leaders and corporate execs overwhelming agree that [lack of demand, not supply is the primary restraining factor on the economy.](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-57405230/demand-not-supply-is-restraining-the-economy/) \n\nI do not support many economic models, overregulation, or high taxes. Nor do I think that the economy is performing well or that stimulus saves money, I agree with the CBO that stimulus' net long-term effect on GDP will be negative. But it's incredibly important to get out of recessions and analysis of specific actions need to be taken into account. You can't say that a lack of a consumer base is having no effect on the economy. \n\nThe jobs created by stimulus are not meant to be permanent, they are designed to incentivize private sector growth by creating new consumers. That private sector growth is what creates employment after the stimulus funds end. \n\nThere is little evidence that supply is the main problem with our economy, most analysis' of stimulus conclude that it was worth it, and I only support running high deficits in times of low demand. My problem with your analysis is that it assumes all the worst without even conceding the most minor of points, like the possibility that the economy needs more consumers for the private sector to hire anyone.

The government should step in and pass legislation to encourage employment. My feelings are that government (for the most part) needs to get out of the way in order for the private sector to create jobs.\n\nThis is a misrepresentation of what I believe. I believe, backed by strong evidence, that there are scenarios where the private sector is risk-adverse to hiring new employees and boosting productivity. I think the government's role in the economy at this point is to get the private sector to hire again. This can happen through either supply or demand. If supply is the problem, then the company is short on cash to hire more people and corporate tax cuts, loans, cash infusions, etc would allow the company to hire more people. \n\nIf demand is the problem, then the problem is that there are not enough consumers. This cannot be fixed independently by the private sector. At this point it is the government's responsibility to directly hire employees who will become consumers of private sector goods, allowing the private sector to flourish.\n\n&gt;Let's contrast this with Gettin_Slizzard who holds a government job as a technician in a computer center. Gettin_Slizzard works just as hard as Nonknower, and actually does a valuable job, keeping the EPA computers safe from viruses. He doesn't actually create anything, and he is not part of a chain that produces a product that is sold to the private sector, but he does keep the EPA computers running smoothly.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, does not create any products that can be sold to the private sector either, but they do create regulations and employ an awful lot of people to support those regulations. There are many Gettin_Slizzard's, thus keeping unemployment down. After all, without the EPA creating precepts, Gettin_Slizzard would not have a job...but here he is earning his $75k salary, and not collecting unemployment.\n\nThis is misleading for a few reasons\n\nFirst, the EPA's purpose is NOT an economic one, but an environmental one. It's goal is NOT to provide employment, but to protect the environment. \n\nSecond, I do not support regulatory action as stimulus. Of course it doesnt boost the economy.\n\nThirdly, the EPA does provide a service that benefits the economy. The EPA is part of a critical economic chain. It provides environmental capital. While overregulation can be a problem, it is wrong to completely dismiss certain economic benefits of SOME regulation. Pollution may degrade air quality and drain the economy because of increased health care spending or declining agricultural productivity. Overfishing provides short-run economic benefits, but dooms ocean ecosystems in the long-run, which even from a purely economic perspective is bad. This ignores direct harm to the public.  \n \nLet's look at a more tangible public service that is less abstract than the EPA and has a more direct impact on the economy. Building of infrastructure is something that the private sector rarely does, because of its high initial capital costs. But free and accessible public transportation and electricity systems provided by the government reduce the costs of operating a business. They also provide for the public good.\n\nIn the case of infrastructure, even assuming it was completely funded by taxes, it is best for the economy in the long-term, because it decreases the cost of living, operating businesses, etc.\n\nThe government has a purpose other than promoting the economy. Promoting the well-being of its citizens by protecting the health and security of them. These must be weighed against potential economic effects. \n\n&gt;So...the fact that Gettin_Slizzard spends his salary on the value chain is not an argument since if Gettin_Slizzard did not have that job, you and I could spend that exact same amount of money on the value chain that creates wealth.\n\nWell actually, this is a concept known as the multiplier effect and it applies to both private and public sector spending.\n\n\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "selftext": "&gt;Gettin_Slizzard's salary as a government worker is nothing more than a \"circulation of capital\"....the government takes it from us and gives it to Gettin_Slizzard so he can spend it....it is the same money, just circulated in a different way.\nIf Gettin_Slizzard's job is paid for through taxation, it has zero effect on the economy. Sorry Gettin_Slizzard, your job makes no difference!!\n\nWhile it is true in the case of taxation that the money must first be taken out of the economy and therefore the stimulative effect will be reduced, it's important to note the goals of stimulus.\n\nBorrowing does not suffer from the same problems, but more of that later. \n\nIt is to create new consumers so the private sector will hire more employees to service these consumers.\n\n&gt; money that is simply printed and put into the economy does not change the world's accumulated wealth...it neither increases it nor decreases it. Because the world's wealth has not increased by the extra $75k the government has put into the economy, we have to ask what happened to it? Well, everyone who holds dollars finds out that their dollars are not worth as much as yesterday. Gettin_Slizzard's salary has come from the inflation of the dollar. This inflation means that everybody has less purchasing power...and cannot spend as much in the value chain of wealth creation\n\nThis isn't exactly true. Inflation is the rise in price for goods and services, for one thing if the gov printed $75k to pay for my job, it would be imperceptible by markets as a share of the total money supply. If the money supply is $1.18 tr, businesses simply cannot charge .000063% more for goods and services. It is ludicrous.\n\nAlso, [this](http://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2011/05/14/money-growth-does-not-cause-inflation/) article is great at explaining the cause of inflation. \n\n&gt; Their final option is to borrow some money from another country and use that to pay Gettin_Slizzard. So the American bankers jump on a plane and fly to China and tell the Chinese...lend us $75k to pay Gettin_Slizzard, and next year we will you back $80k, ok? The Chinese like this deal....after all, with the full faith and credit of the United States Government, a mere $75k loan is very easy to do.\nSo, the Bankers come back with $75k in fresh US $100 bills stuffing their pockets and give that to Gettin_Slizzard for his valuable work at the EPA.\nGettin_Slizzard spends that money in exactly the same way as Nonknower. But the economy doesn't change...why? Because the mere borrowing of money does not create new wealth. The inflow of the $75k from China has created exactly the same inflation as if the money had simply been printed in the first place.\nSo...the problem is that this is no different than the impact of printing money. Simply a circulation of capital!\nBut it becomes more distressing..\nAmerica has to pay China back...and since the government has no money of its own, it has three choices. Raise taxes, print money, or borrow money.\nCan you see a pattern developing? When we borrow money to pay Gettin_Slizzard, we find ourselves in a never ending cycle of higher taxes, inflation and growing debt. This unsound economic structure will eventually come crashing down.\n\nFirst, the vast majority of borrowed money comes from US citizens, which means they weren't investing that money in the first place. Though, there is a possibility of a crowd-out effect, it rarely overwhelms the stimulative effect of borrowed stimulus.\n\nSecond, it is not inflation, because it is a method of creating wealth without printing any money. It is an exchange of spending now for spending later. \n\nThirdly, this assumes positive interest rates. While this is normally the case, we have [recently](http://www.epi.org/blog/infrastructure-benefits/) seen a very interesting scenario where interest rates were negative, meaning that markets were willing to pay the government to spend money.\n\nFourthly, stimulus-funded employees ARE NOT PERMANENT. Using this example, let's say a stimulus project funds a construction company using borrowed money to be paid back in 5 years. The worker is directed to make improvements to a highly congested highway. The construction company is desperate for work and begins construction. It pays its employees and they spend that money in the economy, that money then gets spent and spent and spent. A local restaurant see that all these construction workers have money to spend, so they hire new employees to service the workers. These new employees then cause other businesses in the area to hire more and etc. The construction company purchased its supplies from a local steel mill, which hires new employees and productive capacity to supply the construction company. These employees contribute to the cyclical growth. When the government creates new consumers, it helps business.\n\nConstruction is finished in a year and the government ends the contract. The restaurant we saw earlier is booming, because of the new consumers and hires the construction company from earlier to increase the capacity of the restaurant. This is when economic growth becomes entirely independent of the government.\n\nThe new jobs means more people are paying taxes and the initial borrowed money to pay for the construction contract is paid off with interest, meaning all parties gained money and profited. This also means no one is trapped in a debt cycle.\n\nMeanwhile the newly improved road does not require future repair work and means the government has to spend less money on repairing the bridge. The less congested road allows for easier access to the restaurant and new customers allows it to flourish. The steel mill now has to pay less gas to bypass the congested highway and can afford to increased its productive capacity. Less congestion means the citizens are wasting less time in traffic and more time working in the economy. A particular pothole on the highway was repaired, meaning the local people no longer have to waste their precious paychecks fixing their vehicles that were damaged by the shotty roadwork that was present before. The new road makes the town more attractive and boosts local property values increasing the retail sector. The less congested road also contributes less to air pollution, saving health care costs, helping the local farmer, and making the people happier, further boosting property values.\n\nThe temporary spending by the government funded a prosperous and permanent growth in the economy. The debts were paid off and the people are happy, healthy, and well off.\n\n\nNow, let me ask you a single question.

All his employees will lose their jobs. Are you saying the government should intervene and loan or grant Mr. Eight Track funding?

I merely picked them as an example of a government agency. I could have used Department of Energy or Transportation. However, that being said, the over-regulation by these government agencies clearly has an adverse effect of the economy. Please note I did not say no regulation.\n\nQuite often, a supposition will look good as an essay, but fundamentally fizzles in the real world. However, Keynesian economics is not one of those suppositions. It falls short both in theory and in real life.I was hoping to avoid the following little synopsis as it can get confusing and a little boring as well. But you have proven yourself a quite worthy opponent and I am running out of responses. Here it is:\n\nKeynes states that the Gross Domestic Product is equal to Consumption plus Investment plus Government Spending plus Net Exports (GDP=C+I+G+NX). So he assumes that if you increase any variable in the equation, the GDP will grow correspondingly. This is what his entire conclusions are centered on.  However, he routinely disregards the fact that plainly transferring wealth is not creating wealth, but rather just apportions it in another way. I will cite some illustrations of this sophistry.\nFirst, envision this: So in order to increase Government Spending (G), you have to increase taxes. Increasing taxes adds value to the variable  Taxes (T). Increasing Taxes means that Consumption (C) will decrease. That is inescapable\nSo the increase in G is offset by the decrease in C due to higher taxes. The GDP doesn\u2019t expand, it is just proportioned differently. A decrease in T (Taxes) has more of an effect on the economy than increasing G (Government spending) Why? Because consumers will only consume what they demand. We decide what has value. If we decide that iPhone 5\u2019s are more important to us than a parking ramp, iPhone 5\u2019s have more value. That\u2019s because only the consumers can choose what has value by demanding it.\nSo when G is increased, production may increase, but not necessarily production of something we demand. For example, if government spending is increased to pay for a parking ramp in the middle of a potato farm, is that good? No, because something was produced which has no value because it\u2019s not in demand. So government spending takes from consumers (the only people that can give value to something), and spends it on things which may not have value.\nEnvision this: According to this logic, shouldn\u2019t the government hire people to run around and damage things? If that was done, the government could spend the money to repair these things. It\u2019s an increase in G and also gives jobs to people. So shouldn\u2019t Keynes want that?\nOf course, the problem is that nothing was created with value. So it did not expand our wealth.\nAll sorts of issues arise when employment becomes an objective rather than a result. Keynesian economics is in large part a theory dedicated to fight unemployment. Since this is the case, all Keynesians are opposed to all technological advancements that make us more productive and successful, right? Of course, not, that would be absurd. But it would be entirely consistent for Keynesians to maintain that viewpoint.\nAnother thing to understand, is that an increase in C (Consumption) is not intrinsically good. This is especially true when NX (Net Exports) decreases when C is increased.\nFor example, if our nation imports 90% of its goods and services, our Net Exports (NX) will be negative, subtracting from our GDP. So what happens if our C increases by 50%? The -NX will increase enormously. So when we have a deficit in NX, when our C increases, the increase in C is offset by the decrease in NX.\nYou mentioned Keynes concept known as the \u201cMultiplier\u201d. The concept states that government spending is a more powerful tool of economic growth than letting the market consume. Assume that every consumer spends $0.75 out of every $1.00 they make. Keynes says that if the government spends $1,000,000 to \u201cstimulate\u201d the economy, you multiply it by a specific number. Let\u2019s say the multiplier is 4. So you multiply the government spending by whatever your multipler is. So in this case, it would be 4 x $1,000,000=$4,000,000. And POOF! That money taken from taxpayers just quadrupled.\nOf course, if you actually think this through, it\u2019s a ridiculous concept. As I mentioned before, the only way value can be added to a product, is through consumer demand, which only the consumers can decide. So when the government consumes, it is taking our money, and spending it on things not necessarily in demand. Since insignificant things are often produced, there is no growth. The only change, is that the consumer who add value to products, have less spending power because the government has taken it and spent it elsewhere.\nThe entire concept of a multiplier is a joke, yet admittedly it is still has a large following with the abundant left leaning economists that promulgate our universities.\nOur economic woes will continue if we do not forsake the ethos that the government can solve the economy by interfering and printing and/or borrowing money. \nOne last comment. You still have not been able to produce a clear cut example of a positive outcome for the Keynesian method. I hope you do not subscribe to the 2009 stimulus as a success. Its my example of its failure.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9jzfz8", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366595629", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9juxgp", "parent_id": "t1_c9juxdq", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431476868, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9juxgp", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366581830", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9juxdq", "parent_id": "t1_c9jtd1o", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431476869, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9juxdq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366581824", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "nonknower", "id": "t1_c9jtd1o", "parent_id": "t1_c9it8q5", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431477607, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think we both agree on one point for sure. That in order for the economic recovery to be bountiful and long lasting, we need more jobs. As stated in an earlier post, with our labor participation rate at its lowest levels in over 30 years, it is no wonder that the economy is mired in the mud. There are two schools of thought on how to fix the economy. It is evident that you subscribe to one set of ideals and I the other.\nYou believe an active government is the catalyst in propelling the economy. The government should step in and pass legislation to encourage employment. My feelings are that government (for the most part) needs to get out of the way in order for the private sector to create jobs. In order to determine which is the best course of action, we need to examine fundamental economic facts. It basically boils down to whether one believes that two similar jobs with equal pay, one in the public sector and one in the private sector are in fact equal. The cursory answer would be yes, they are the same. \nLet me extrapolate on a hypothetical example.\nGettin_Slizzard works in the IT department  for the Environmental Protection Agency. He earns 75k annually. He is able to buy food, pay his mortgage, run his car, educate his kids and maybe even purchase a new 65 inch big screen TV and go on a vacation to Disney World. Oh, and he also pays federal taxes just like everybody else.\n\nNonknower, who works in the IT Department in a private company, also gets paid a $75k salary. After paying his taxes he can also pay his mortgage, buy food, make his car payment, educate his kids and watch the Super Bowl on his new 65\" TV, and go visit Mickey Mouse with the family.\n\nSeemingly, both Getting_Slizzard and Nonknower have the same funds to spend on the same stuff. Thus, both jobs economically the same, correct?\n\nIf you go along with that assertion you could not be more mistaken. They are not alike economically. They are not in the same ballpark.\n\nNonknower works in the private sector. His efforts at work create a product that his employer sells into a market that, with free will, determines whether that product is good value or not. If Nonknower's employer is a smart entrepreneur, then there is value being created by Nonknower, and that value eventually translates into additional wealth that has been created. The additional wealth is shared by Nonknower's employer and his co-workers and indeed everybody who is along the productivity chain, from the providers of the raw material through to the salesman's commission. Not only is value and wealth created along that production chain, but because of Nonknower's ability to spend, it also occurs in every value chain that Nonknower spends his money on. This includes farmers, energy workers, car manufacturers and everywhere throughout the economy.\n\nNow, that all makes sense and is very logical but this is the key point that you should realize.\n\nNonknower's salary gets paid because the accumulated wealth of the world has increased in value. His salary does not get paid because someone else gets paid nothing, or less than they were getting. The ability to pay Nonknower's salary is 100% dependent on the ability of his employer to create wealth where it was not existing before. By the way, that wealth is usually called profit. Profit is not a bad word, it does not steal from the worker, or take from someone else...it is simply the creation of wealth.\n\nLet's contrast this with Gettin_Slizzard who holds a government job as a technician in a computer center. Gettin_Slizzard works just as hard as Nonknower, and actually does a valuable job, keeping the EPA computers safe from viruses. He doesn't actually create anything, and he is not part of a chain that produces a product that is sold to the private sector, but he does keep the EPA computers running smoothly.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, does not create any products that can be sold to the private sector either, but they do create regulations and employ an awful lot of people to support those regulations. There are many Gettin_Slizzard's, thus keeping unemployment down. After all, without the EPA creating precepts, Gettin_Slizzard would not have a job...but here he is earning his $75k salary, and not collecting unemployment.\n\nAnd of course, he takes his salary and spends it and that keeps entire value chains creating new wealth, so it is all good!\n\nNot quite. Since Gettin_Slizzard has to get paid, the government has no revenues or profits, so where does the money for Gettin_Slizzard's salary come from? It comes from one of three places. Taxation, printing money or borrowing money. There is no other way that Gettin_Slizzard can get paid.\n\nSo let's take a look at these three sources of Gettin_Slizzard's salary:\n \nTaxation\n\nIf Gettin_Slizzard did not have his job at the EPA, we would not have to pay $75k in taxes. If we did not have to pay a further $75k in taxes, it would be available to be spent on the value chain that creates additional wealth.\n\nSo...the fact that Gettin_Slizzard spends his salary on the value chain is not an argument since if Gettin_Slizzard did not have that job, you and I could spend that exact same amount of money on the value chain that creates wealth.\n\nGettin_Slizzard's salary as a government worker is nothing more than a \"circulation of capital\"....the government takes it from us and gives it to Gettin_Slizzard so he can spend it....it is the same money, just circulated in a different way.\n\nIf Gettin_Slizzard's job is paid for through taxation, it has zero effect on the economy. Sorry Gettin_Slizzard, your job makes no difference!!\n\nPrinting Money\n\nLet's make a simple assumption. The government was unable to tax us $75k more to pay for Gettin_Slizzard's job. The government knew that if it did that we would revolt and throw the bums out of office. We were not willing to pay any more tax so that Gettin_Slizzard could have a job.\n\nThe government still thinks they need Gettin_Slizzard to keep the computers at the EPA running, so they give him a job, and, since they are the government, simply print an extra $75k in notes that they can use for his salary. In fact, that is an even better deal for the economy because the Government is no longer simply circulating capital, but is increasing cash going into the economy because of the value that Gettin_Slizzard's job provides in building wealth.\n\nWell, this sounds good except for two things. The first is that Gettin_Slizzard's job does not create any wealth. And the second is that money that is simply printed and put into the economy does not change the world's accumulated wealth...it neither increases it nor decreases it. Because the world's wealth has not increased by the extra $75k the government has put into the economy, we have to ask what happened to it? Well, everyone who holds dollars finds out that their dollars are not worth as much as yesterday. Gettin_Slizzard's salary has come from the inflation of the dollar. This inflation means that everybody has less purchasing power...and cannot spend as much in the value chain of wealth creation.\n\nIn this case Gettin_Slizzard gets paid by reducing how much you can purchase with your money. This is the effect of inflation, which is used to pay Gettin_Slizzard's salary. Gettin_Slizzard has created no new wealth, and Gettin_Slizzard's salary has contributed no more to economic wealth than if he did not have the job at all. This again, is simply circulation of capital and cannot in any way create wealth and grow the economy. Sorry Gettin_Slizzard...your job is not looking real good right now...maybe if the government borrowed?\n\nGovernment Borrowing\n\nSo, the government cannot increase taxation or simply print money to pay for Gettin_Slizzard's salary.\n\nTheir final option is to borrow some money from another country and use that to pay Gettin_Slizzard. So the American bankers hop on a Lear Jet to Beijing and tell the Chinese...lend us $75k to pay Gettin_Slizzard, and next year we will pay you back $80k. The Chinese accept this deal....at the end of the day, with the full faith and credit of the United States Government, a mere $75k loan is very easy to do.\n\nSo, the Bankers come back with $75k in their attache cases and give that to Gettin_Slizzard for his beneficial labor at the EPA.\n\nGettin_Slizzard spends that money in exactly the same way as Nonknower. But the economy doesn't change...why? Because the sheer borrowing of money does not create new wealth. The introduction of the $75k from China has established precisly the same inflation as if the money had simply been printed in the first place.\n\nSo...the problem is that this is no different than the outcome of printing money. Simply a circulation of capital!\n\nBut it becomes more distressing..\n\nAmerica has to pay China back...and since the government has no money of its own, it has three choices. Raise taxes, print money, or borrow money.\n\nCan you see a pattern developing? When we borrow money to pay Gettin_Slizzard, we find ourselves in a never ending cycle of  higher taxes, inflation and growing debt. This unsound economic structure will eventually come crashing down.\n\nI think the above examples show exactly the reason why Keynesian policies have never, and will never succeed in improving the economy in a healthy and sustained manner.\n\n", "edited": 1366586391, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9jtd1o", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366577110", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9it8q5", "parent_id": "t1_c9is8uu", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431495114, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9it8q5", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366419298", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}

That private sector growth is what creates employment after the stimulus funds end. \n\nThere is little evidence that supply is the main problem with our economy, most analysis' of stimulus conclude that it was worth it, and I only support running high deficits in times of low demand. My problem with your analysis is that it assumes all the worst without even conceding the most minor of points, like the possibility that the economy needs more consumers for the private sector to hire anyone. ", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "selftext": "&gt; You believe an active government is the catalyst in propelling the economy. The government should step in and pass legislation to encourage employment. My feelings are that government (for the most part) needs to get out of the way in order for the private sector to create jobs.\n\nThis is a misrepresentation of what I believe. I believe, backed by strong evidence, that there are scenarios where the private sector is risk-adverse to hiring new employees and boosting productivity. I think the government's role in the economy at this point is to get the private sector to hire again. This can happen through either supply or demand. If supply is the problem, then the company is short on cash to hire more people and corporate tax cuts, loans, cash infusions, etc would allow the company to hire more people. \n\nIf demand is the problem, then the problem is that there are not enough consumers. This cannot be fixed independently by the private sector. At this point it is the government's responsibility to directly hire employees who will become consumers of private sector goods, allowing the private sector to flourish.\n\n&gt;Let's contrast this with Gettin_Slizzard who holds a government job as a technician in a computer center. Gettin_Slizzard works just as hard as Nonknower, and actually does a valuable job, keeping the EPA computers safe from viruses. He doesn't actually create anything, and he is not part of a chain that produces a product that is sold to the private sector, but he does keep the EPA computers running smoothly.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, does not create any products that can be sold to the private sector either, but they do create regulations and employ an awful lot of people to support those regulations. There are many Gettin_Slizzard's, thus keeping unemployment down. After all, without the EPA creating precepts, Gettin_Slizzard would not have a job...but here he is earning his $75k salary, and not collecting unemployment.\n\nThis is misleading for a few reasons\n\nFirst, the EPA's purpose is NOT an economic one, but an environmental one. It's goal is NOT to provide employment, but to protect the environment. \n\nSecond, I do not support regulatory action as stimulus. Of course it doesnt boost the economy.\n\nThirdly, the EPA does provide a service that benefits the economy. The EPA is part of a critical economic chain. It provides environmental capital. While overregulation can be a problem, it is wrong to completely dismiss certain economic benefits of SOME regulation. Pollution may degrade air quality and drain the economy because of increased health care spending or declining agricultural productivity. Overfishing provides short-run economic benefits, but dooms ocean ecosystems in the long-run, which even from a purely economic perspective is bad. This ignores direct harm to the public.  \n \nLet's look at a more tangible public service that is less abstract than the EPA and has a more direct impact on the economy. Building of infrastructure is something that the private sector rarely does, because of its high initial capital costs. But free and accessible public transportation and electricity systems provided by the government reduce the costs of operating a business. They also provide for the public good.\n\nIn the case of infrastructure, even assuming it was completely funded by taxes, it is best for the economy in the long-term, because it decreases the cost of living, operating businesses, etc.\n\nThe government has a purpose other than promoting the economy. Promoting the well-being of its citizens by protecting the health and security of them. These must be weighed against potential economic effects. \n\n&gt;So...the fact that Gettin_Slizzard spends his salary on the value chain is not an argument since if Gettin_Slizzard did not have that job, you and I could spend that exact same amount of money on the value chain that creates wealth.\n\nWell actually, this is a concept known as the multiplier effect and it applies to both private and public sector spending.\n\n\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "selftext": "&gt;Gettin_Slizzard's salary as a government worker is nothing more than a \"circulation of capital\"....the government takes it from us and gives it to Gettin_Slizzard so he can spend it....it is the same money, just circulated in a different way.\nIf Gettin_Slizzard's job is paid for through taxation, it has zero effect on the economy. Sorry Gettin_Slizzard, your job makes no difference!!\n\nWhile it is true in the case of taxation that the money must first be taken out of the economy and therefore the stimulative effect will be reduced, it's important to note the goals of stimulus.\n\nBorrowing does not suffer from the same problems, but more of that later. \n\nIt is to create new consumers so the private sector will hire more employees to service these consumers.\n\n&gt; money that is simply printed and put into the economy does not change the world's accumulated wealth...it neither increases it nor decreases it. Because the world's wealth has not increased by the extra $75k the government has put into the economy, we have to ask what happened to it? Well, everyone who holds dollars finds out that their dollars are not worth as much as yesterday. Gettin_Slizzard's salary has come from the inflation of the dollar. This inflation means that everybody has less purchasing power...and cannot spend as much in the value chain of wealth creation\n\nThis isn't exactly true. Inflation is the rise in price for goods and services, for one thing if the gov printed $75k to pay for my job, it would be imperceptible by markets as a share of the total money supply. If the money supply is $1.18 tr, businesses simply cannot charge .000063% more for goods and services. It is ludicrous.\n\nAlso, [this](http://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2011/05/14/money-growth-does-not-cause-inflation/) article is great at explaining the cause of inflation. \n\n&gt; Their final option is to borrow some money from another country and use that to pay Gettin_Slizzard. So the American bankers jump on a plane and fly to China and tell the Chinese...lend us $75k to pay Gettin_Slizzard, and next year we will you back $80k, ok? The Chinese like this deal....after all, with the full faith and credit of the United States Government, a mere $75k loan is very easy to do.\nSo, the Bankers come back with $75k in fresh US $100 bills stuffing their pockets and give that to Gettin_Slizzard for his valuable work at the EPA.\nGettin_Slizzard spends that money in exactly the same way as Nonknower. But the economy doesn't change...why? Because the mere borrowing of money does not create new wealth. The inflow of the $75k from China has created exactly the same inflation as if the money had simply been printed in the first place.\nSo...the problem is that this is no different than the impact of printing money. Simply a circulation of capital!\nBut it becomes more distressing..\nAmerica has to pay China back...and since the government has no money of its own, it has three choices. Raise taxes, print money, or borrow money.\nCan you see a pattern developing? When we borrow money to pay Gettin_Slizzard, we find ourselves in a never ending cycle of higher taxes, inflation and growing debt. This unsound economic structure will eventually come crashing down.\n\nFirst, the vast majority of borrowed money comes from US citizens, which means they weren't investing that money in the first place. Though, there is a possibility of a crowd-out effect, it rarely overwhelms the stimulative effect of borrowed stimulus.\n\nSecond, it is not inflation, because it is a method of creating wealth without printing any money. It is an exchange of spending now for spending later. \n\nThirdly, this assumes positive interest rates. While this is normally the case, we have [recently](http://www.epi.org/blog/infrastructure-benefits/) seen a very interesting scenario where interest rates were negative, meaning that markets were willing to pay the government to spend money.\n\nFourthly, stimulus-funded employees ARE NOT PERMANENT. Using this example, let's say a stimulus project funds a construction company using borrowed money to be paid back in 5 years. The worker is directed to make improvements to a highly congested highway. The construction company is desperate for work and begins construction. It pays its employees and they spend that money in the economy, that money then gets spent and spent and spent. A local restaurant see that all these construction workers have money to spend, so they hire new employees to service the workers. These new employees then cause other businesses in the area to hire more and etc. The construction company purchased its supplies from a local steel mill, which hires new employees and productive capacity to supply the construction company. These employees contribute to the cyclical growth. When the government creates new consumers, it helps business.\n\nConstruction is finished in a year and the government ends the contract. The restaurant we saw earlier is booming, because of the new consumers and hires the construction company from earlier to increase the capacity of the restaurant. This is when economic growth becomes entirely independent of the government.\n\nThe new jobs means more people are paying taxes and the initial borrowed money to pay for the construction contract is paid off with interest, meaning all parties gained money and profited. This also means no one is trapped in a debt cycle.\n\nMeanwhile the newly improved road does not require future repair work and means the government has to spend less money on repairing the bridge. The less congested road allows for easier access to the restaurant and new customers allows it to flourish. The steel mill now has to pay less gas to bypass the congested highway and can afford to increased its productive capacity. Less congestion means the citizens are wasting less time in traffic and more time working in the economy. A particular pothole on the highway was repaired, meaning the local people no longer have to waste their precious paychecks fixing their vehicles that were damaged by the shotty roadwork that was present before. The new road makes the town more attractive and boosts local property values increasing the retail sector. The less congested road also contributes less to air pollution, saving health care costs, helping the local farmer, and making the people happier, further boosting property values.\n\nThe temporary spending by the government funded a prosperous and permanent growth in the economy. The debts were paid off and the people are happy, healthy, and well off.\n\n\nNow, let me ask you a single question.

All his employees will lose their jobs. Are you saying the government should intervene and loan or grant Mr. Eight Track funding?

I merely picked them as an example of a government agency. I could have used Department of Energy or Transportation. However, that being said, the over-regulation by these government agencies clearly has an adverse effect of the economy. Please note I did not say no regulation.\n\nQuite often, a supposition will look good as an essay, but fundamentally fizzles in the real world. However, Keynesian economics is not one of those suppositions. It falls short both in theory and in real life.I was hoping to avoid the following little synopsis as it can get confusing and a little boring as well. But you have proven yourself a quite worthy opponent and I am running out of responses. Here it is:\n\nKeynes states that the Gross Domestic Product is equal to Consumption plus Investment plus Government Spending plus Net Exports (GDP=C+I+G+NX). So he assumes that if you increase any variable in the equation, the GDP will grow correspondingly. This is what his entire conclusions are centered on.  However, he routinely disregards the fact that plainly transferring wealth is not creating wealth, but rather just apportions it in another way. I will cite some illustrations of this sophistry.\nFirst, envision this: So in order to increase Government Spending (G), you have to increase taxes. Increasing taxes adds value to the variable  Taxes (T). Increasing Taxes means that Consumption (C) will decrease. That is inescapable\nSo the increase in G is offset by the decrease in C due to higher taxes. The GDP doesn\u2019t expand, it is just proportioned differently. A decrease in T (Taxes) has more of an effect on the economy than increasing G (Government spending) Why? Because consumers will only consume what they demand. We decide what has value. If we decide that iPhone 5\u2019s are more important to us than a parking ramp, iPhone 5\u2019s have more value. That\u2019s because only the consumers can choose what has value by demanding it.\nSo when G is increased, production may increase, but not necessarily production of something we demand. For example, if government spending is increased to pay for a parking ramp in the middle of a potato farm, is that good? No, because something was produced which has no value because it\u2019s not in demand. So government spending takes from consumers (the only people that can give value to something), and spends it on things which may not have value.\nEnvision this: According to this logic, shouldn\u2019t the government hire people to run around and damage things? If that was done, the government could spend the money to repair these things. It\u2019s an increase in G and also gives jobs to people. So shouldn\u2019t Keynes want that?\nOf course, the problem is that nothing was created with value. So it did not expand our wealth.\nAll sorts of issues arise when employment becomes an objective rather than a result. Keynesian economics is in large part a theory dedicated to fight unemployment. Since this is the case, all Keynesians are opposed to all technological advancements that make us more productive and successful, right? Of course, not, that would be absurd. But it would be entirely consistent for Keynesians to maintain that viewpoint.\nAnother thing to understand, is that an increase in C (Consumption) is not intrinsically good. This is especially true when NX (Net Exports) decreases when C is increased.\nFor example, if our nation imports 90% of its goods and services, our Net Exports (NX) will be negative, subtracting from our GDP. So what happens if our C increases by 50%? The -NX will increase enormously. So when we have a deficit in NX, when our C increases, the increase in C is offset by the decrease in NX.\nYou mentioned Keynes concept known as the \u201cMultiplier\u201d. The concept states that government spending is a more powerful tool of economic growth than letting the market consume. Assume that every consumer spends $0.75 out of every $1.00 they make. Keynes says that if the government spends $1,000,000 to \u201cstimulate\u201d the economy, you multiply it by a specific number. Let\u2019s say the multiplier is 4. So you multiply the government spending by whatever your multipler is. So in this case, it would be 4 x $1,000,000=$4,000,000. And POOF! That money taken from taxpayers just quadrupled.\nOf course, if you actually think this through, it\u2019s a ridiculous concept. As I mentioned before, the only way value can be added to a product, is through consumer demand, which only the consumers can decide. So when the government consumes, it is taking our money, and spending it on things not necessarily in demand. Since insignificant things are often produced, there is no growth. The only change, is that the consumer who add value to products, have less spending power because the government has taken it and spent it elsewhere.\nThe entire concept of a multiplier is a joke, yet admittedly it is still has a large following with the abundant left leaning economists that promulgate our universities.\nOur economic woes will continue if we do not forsake the ethos that the government can solve the economy by interfering and printing and/or borrowing money. \nOne last comment. You still have not been able to produce a clear cut example of a positive outcome for the Keynesian method. I hope you do not subscribe to the 2009 stimulus as a success. Its my example of its failure.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9jzfz8", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366595629", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9juxgp", "parent_id": "t1_c9juxdq", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431476868, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9juxgp", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366581830", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9juxdq", "parent_id": "t1_c9jtd1o", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431476869, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9juxdq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366581824", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "nonknower", "id": "t1_c9jtd1o", "parent_id": "t1_c9it8q5", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431477607, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think we both agree on one point for sure. That in order for the economic recovery to be bountiful and long lasting, we need more jobs. As stated in an earlier post, with our labor participation rate at its lowest levels in over 30 years, it is no wonder that the economy is mired in the mud. There are two schools of thought on how to fix the economy. It is evident that you subscribe to one set of ideals and I the other.\nYou believe an active government is the catalyst in propelling the economy. The government should step in and pass legislation to encourage employment. My feelings are that government (for the most part) needs to get out of the way in order for the private sector to create jobs. In order to determine which is the best course of action, we need to examine fundamental economic facts. It basically boils down to whether one believes that two similar jobs with equal pay, one in the public sector and one in the private sector are in fact equal. The cursory answer would be yes, they are the same. \nLet me extrapolate on a hypothetical example.\nGettin_Slizzard works in the IT department  for the Environmental Protection Agency. He earns 75k annually. He is able to buy food, pay his mortgage, run his car, educate his kids and maybe even purchase a new 65 inch big screen TV and go on a vacation to Disney World. Oh, and he also pays federal taxes just like everybody else.\n\nNonknower, who works in the IT Department in a private company, also gets paid a $75k salary. After paying his taxes he can also pay his mortgage, buy food, make his car payment, educate his kids and watch the Super Bowl on his new 65\" TV, and go visit Mickey Mouse with the family.\n\nSeemingly, both Getting_Slizzard and Nonknower have the same funds to spend on the same stuff. Thus, both jobs economically the same, correct?\n\nIf you go along with that assertion you could not be more mistaken. They are not alike economically. They are not in the same ballpark.\n\nNonknower works in the private sector. His efforts at work create a product that his employer sells into a market that, with free will, determines whether that product is good value or not. If Nonknower's employer is a smart entrepreneur, then there is value being created by Nonknower, and that value eventually translates into additional wealth that has been created. The additional wealth is shared by Nonknower's employer and his co-workers and indeed everybody who is along the productivity chain, from the providers of the raw material through to the salesman's commission. Not only is value and wealth created along that production chain, but because of Nonknower's ability to spend, it also occurs in every value chain that Nonknower spends his money on. This includes farmers, energy workers, car manufacturers and everywhere throughout the economy.\n\nNow, that all makes sense and is very logical but this is the key point that you should realize.\n\nNonknower's salary gets paid because the accumulated wealth of the world has increased in value. His salary does not get paid because someone else gets paid nothing, or less than they were getting. The ability to pay Nonknower's salary is 100% dependent on the ability of his employer to create wealth where it was not existing before. By the way, that wealth is usually called profit. Profit is not a bad word, it does not steal from the worker, or take from someone else...it is simply the creation of wealth.\n\nLet's contrast this with Gettin_Slizzard who holds a government job as a technician in a computer center. Gettin_Slizzard works just as hard as Nonknower, and actually does a valuable job, keeping the EPA computers safe from viruses. He doesn't actually create anything, and he is not part of a chain that produces a product that is sold to the private sector, but he does keep the EPA computers running smoothly.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, does not create any products that can be sold to the private sector either, but they do create regulations and employ an awful lot of people to support those regulations. There are many Gettin_Slizzard's, thus keeping unemployment down. After all, without the EPA creating precepts, Gettin_Slizzard would not have a job...but here he is earning his $75k salary, and not collecting unemployment.\n\nAnd of course, he takes his salary and spends it and that keeps entire value chains creating new wealth, so it is all good!\n\nNot quite. Since Gettin_Slizzard has to get paid, the government has no revenues or profits, so where does the money for Gettin_Slizzard's salary come from? It comes from one of three places. Taxation, printing money or borrowing money. There is no other way that Gettin_Slizzard can get paid.\n\nSo let's take a look at these three sources of Gettin_Slizzard's salary:\n \nTaxation\n\nIf Gettin_Slizzard did not have his job at the EPA, we would not have to pay $75k in taxes. If we did not have to pay a further $75k in taxes, it would be available to be spent on the value chain that creates additional wealth.\n\nSo...the fact that Gettin_Slizzard spends his salary on the value chain is not an argument since if Gettin_Slizzard did not have that job, you and I could spend that exact same amount of money on the value chain that creates wealth.\n\nGettin_Slizzard's salary as a government worker is nothing more than a \"circulation of capital\"....the government takes it from us and gives it to Gettin_Slizzard so he can spend it....it is the same money, just circulated in a different way.\n\nIf Gettin_Slizzard's job is paid for through taxation, it has zero effect on the economy. Sorry Gettin_Slizzard, your job makes no difference!!\n\nPrinting Money\n\nLet's make a simple assumption. The government was unable to tax us $75k more to pay for Gettin_Slizzard's job. The government knew that if it did that we would revolt and throw the bums out of office. We were not willing to pay any more tax so that Gettin_Slizzard could have a job.\n\nThe government still thinks they need Gettin_Slizzard to keep the computers at the EPA running, so they give him a job, and, since they are the government, simply print an extra $75k in notes that they can use for his salary. In fact, that is an even better deal for the economy because the Government is no longer simply circulating capital, but is increasing cash going into the economy because of the value that Gettin_Slizzard's job provides in building wealth.\n\nWell, this sounds good except for two things. The first is that Gettin_Slizzard's job does not create any wealth. And the second is that money that is simply printed and put into the economy does not change the world's accumulated wealth...it neither increases it nor decreases it. Because the world's wealth has not increased by the extra $75k the government has put into the economy, we have to ask what happened to it? Well, everyone who holds dollars finds out that their dollars are not worth as much as yesterday. Gettin_Slizzard's salary has come from the inflation of the dollar. This inflation means that everybody has less purchasing power...and cannot spend as much in the value chain of wealth creation.\n\nIn this case Gettin_Slizzard gets paid by reducing how much you can purchase with your money. This is the effect of inflation, which is used to pay Gettin_Slizzard's salary. Gettin_Slizzard has created no new wealth, and Gettin_Slizzard's salary has contributed no more to economic wealth than if he did not have the job at all. This again, is simply circulation of capital and cannot in any way create wealth and grow the economy. Sorry Gettin_Slizzard...your job is not looking real good right now...maybe if the government borrowed?\n\nGovernment Borrowing\n\nSo, the government cannot increase taxation or simply print money to pay for Gettin_Slizzard's salary.\n\nTheir final option is to borrow some money from another country and use that to pay Gettin_Slizzard. So the American bankers hop on a Lear Jet to Beijing and tell the Chinese...lend us $75k to pay Gettin_Slizzard, and next year we will pay you back $80k. The Chinese accept this deal....at the end of the day, with the full faith and credit of the United States Government, a mere $75k loan is very easy to do.\n\nSo, the Bankers come back with $75k in their attache cases and give that to Gettin_Slizzard for his beneficial labor at the EPA.\n\nGettin_Slizzard spends that money in exactly the same way as Nonknower. But the economy doesn't change...why? Because the sheer borrowing of money does not create new wealth. The introduction of the $75k from China has established precisly the same inflation as if the money had simply been printed in the first place.\n\nSo...the problem is that this is no different than the outcome of printing money. Simply a circulation of capital!\n\nBut it becomes more distressing..\n\nAmerica has to pay China back...and since the government has no money of its own, it has three choices. Raise taxes, print money, or borrow money.\n\nCan you see a pattern developing? When we borrow money to pay Gettin_Slizzard, we find ourselves in a never ending cycle of  higher taxes, inflation and growing debt. This unsound economic structure will eventually come crashing down.\n\nI think the above examples show exactly the reason why Keynesian policies have never, and will never succeed in improving the economy in a healthy and sustained manner.\n\n", "edited": 1366586391, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9jtd1o", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366577110", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9it8q5", "parent_id": "t1_c9is8uu", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431495114, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9it8q5", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366419298", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "nonknower", "id": "t1_c9is8uu", "parent_id": "t1_c9i3dvk", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431495583, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Huge growth in spending and deficits, increase the prospect of future tax increases. Many people realize that increased spending must be paid for sooner or later. Concern over future tax rates is one of the main reasons for heightened uncertainty and reduced confidence. Most of the government spending programs redistribute income from workers to the unemployed. This, Keynesians stress, increases the betterment of many hurt by the recession. What their models disregard, however, is the reduced productivity that follows a shift of resources toward redistribution and away from productive investment. Keynesian theory argues that each dollar of government spending has a larger effect on output than a dollar of tax reduction. But in reality the reverse has proven true. Permanent tax reduction generates more expansion than increased government spending of the same dollars. The resulting difference in productivity is a main reason for the difference in results.  Keynesian models ignore the adverse effects of the costly regulations that stream out of the bureaucracy. We also have an overzealous group of financial regulators, guardians of unions, and environmental regulators . Their determinations increase future costs and breed uneasiness. How can corporate executives approximate future return on new investment when tax rates and costs are mystifying? Holding cash and waiting for less uncertainty is the predominant reaction. Hence, the \"economic recovery\" dawdles. Job creation in March was a sad 88,000. The labor particpation rate is the lowest since Jimmy Carter was President http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/04/07/march-labor-force-participation/2057887/.\nCurrent American monetary policies are primarily aimed at getting short term result. A conservative estimate of the cost of new jobs produced from the stimulus bill is at least $170,000 per job http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/nbrnberwo/16759.htm . How can that please taxpayers who will assume those costs? Once the funding ends, the jobs vanish, but the bonds that financed them remain and must be satisfied. These medium and long-term results are discounted in Keynesian paradigms. Noticeably, a more proficient fiscal policy would bring back the long-term growth rate by diminishing uncertainty and restoring corporate and consumer confidence.

You can't say that a lack of a consumer base is having no effect on the economy. \n\nThe jobs created by stimulus are not meant to be permanent, they are designed to incentivize private sector growth by creating new consumers. That private sector growth is what creates employment after the stimulus funds end. \n\nThere is little evidence that supply is the main problem with our economy, most analysis' of stimulus conclude that it was worth it, and I only support running high deficits in times of low demand. My problem with your analysis is that it assumes all the worst without even conceding the most minor of points, like the possibility that the economy needs more consumers for the private sector to hire anyone. ", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "selftext": "&gt; You believe an active government is the catalyst in propelling the economy. The government should step in and pass legislation to encourage employment. My feelings are that government (for the most part) needs to get out of the way in order for the private sector to create jobs.\n\nThis is a misrepresentation of what I believe. I believe, backed by strong evidence, that there are scenarios where the private sector is risk-adverse to hiring new employees and boosting productivity. I think the government's role in the economy at this point is to get the private sector to hire again. This can happen through either supply or demand. If supply is the problem, then the company is short on cash to hire more people and corporate tax cuts, loans, cash infusions, etc would allow the company to hire more people. \n\nIf demand is the problem, then the problem is that there are not enough consumers. This cannot be fixed independently by the private sector. At this point it is the government's responsibility to directly hire employees who will become consumers of private sector goods, allowing the private sector to flourish.\n\n&gt;Let's contrast this with Gettin_Slizzard who holds a government job as a technician in a computer center. Gettin_Slizzard works just as hard as Nonknower, and actually does a valuable job, keeping the EPA computers safe from viruses. He doesn't actually create anything, and he is not part of a chain that produces a product that is sold to the private sector, but he does keep the EPA computers running smoothly.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, does not create any products that can be sold to the private sector either, but they do create regulations and employ an awful lot of people to support those regulations. There are many Gettin_Slizzard's, thus keeping unemployment down. After all, without the EPA creating precepts, Gettin_Slizzard would not have a job...but here he is earning his $75k salary, and not collecting unemployment.\n\nThis is misleading for a few reasons\n\nFirst, the EPA's purpose is NOT an economic one, but an environmental one. It's goal is NOT to provide employment, but to protect the environment. \n\nSecond, I do not support regulatory action as stimulus. Of course it doesnt boost the economy.\n\nThirdly, the EPA does provide a service that benefits the economy. The EPA is part of a critical economic chain. It provides environmental capital. While overregulation can be a problem, it is wrong to completely dismiss certain economic benefits of SOME regulation. Pollution may degrade air quality and drain the economy because of increased health care spending or declining agricultural productivity. Overfishing provides short-run economic benefits, but dooms ocean ecosystems in the long-run, which even from a purely economic perspective is bad. This ignores direct harm to the public.  \n \nLet's look at a more tangible public service that is less abstract than the EPA and has a more direct impact on the economy. Building of infrastructure is something that the private sector rarely does, because of its high initial capital costs. But free and accessible public transportation and electricity systems provided by the government reduce the costs of operating a business. They also provide for the public good.\n\nIn the case of infrastructure, even assuming it was completely funded by taxes, it is best for the economy in the long-term, because it decreases the cost of living, operating businesses, etc.\n\nThe government has a purpose other than promoting the economy. Promoting the well-being of its citizens by protecting the health and security of them. These must be weighed against potential economic effects. \n\n&gt;So...the fact that Gettin_Slizzard spends his salary on the value chain is not an argument since if Gettin_Slizzard did not have that job, you and I could spend that exact same amount of money on the value chain that creates wealth.\n\nWell actually, this is a concept known as the multiplier effect and it applies to both private and public sector spending.\n\n\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "selftext": "&gt;Gettin_Slizzard's salary as a government worker is nothing more than a \"circulation of capital\"....the government takes it from us and gives it to Gettin_Slizzard so he can spend it....it is the same money, just circulated in a different way.\nIf Gettin_Slizzard's job is paid for through taxation, it has zero effect on the economy. Sorry Gettin_Slizzard, your job makes no difference!!\n\nWhile it is true in the case of taxation that the money must first be taken out of the economy and therefore the stimulative effect will be reduced, it's important to note the goals of stimulus.\n\nBorrowing does not suffer from the same problems, but more of that later. \n\nIt is to create new consumers so the private sector will hire more employees to service these consumers.\n\n&gt; money that is simply printed and put into the economy does not change the world's accumulated wealth...it neither increases it nor decreases it. Because the world's wealth has not increased by the extra $75k the government has put into the economy, we have to ask what happened to it? Well, everyone who holds dollars finds out that their dollars are not worth as much as yesterday. Gettin_Slizzard's salary has come from the inflation of the dollar. This inflation means that everybody has less purchasing power...and cannot spend as much in the value chain of wealth creation\n\nThis isn't exactly true. Inflation is the rise in price for goods and services, for one thing if the gov printed $75k to pay for my job, it would be imperceptible by markets as a share of the total money supply. If the money supply is $1.18 tr, businesses simply cannot charge .000063% more for goods and services. It is ludicrous.\n\nAlso, [this](http://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2011/05/14/money-growth-does-not-cause-inflation/) article is great at explaining the cause of inflation. \n\n&gt; Their final option is to borrow some money from another country and use that to pay Gettin_Slizzard. So the American bankers jump on a plane and fly to China and tell the Chinese...lend us $75k to pay Gettin_Slizzard, and next year we will you back $80k, ok? The Chinese like this deal....after all, with the full faith and credit of the United States Government, a mere $75k loan is very easy to do.\nSo, the Bankers come back with $75k in fresh US $100 bills stuffing their pockets and give that to Gettin_Slizzard for his valuable work at the EPA.\nGettin_Slizzard spends that money in exactly the same way as Nonknower. But the economy doesn't change...why? Because the mere borrowing of money does not create new wealth. The inflow of the $75k from China has created exactly the same inflation as if the money had simply been printed in the first place.\nSo...the problem is that this is no different than the impact of printing money. Simply a circulation of capital!\nBut it becomes more distressing..\nAmerica has to pay China back...and since the government has no money of its own, it has three choices. Raise taxes, print money, or borrow money.\nCan you see a pattern developing? When we borrow money to pay Gettin_Slizzard, we find ourselves in a never ending cycle of higher taxes, inflation and growing debt. This unsound economic structure will eventually come crashing down.\n\nFirst, the vast majority of borrowed money comes from US citizens, which means they weren't investing that money in the first place. Though, there is a possibility of a crowd-out effect, it rarely overwhelms the stimulative effect of borrowed stimulus.\n\nSecond, it is not inflation, because it is a method of creating wealth without printing any money. It is an exchange of spending now for spending later. \n\nThirdly, this assumes positive interest rates. While this is normally the case, we have [recently](http://www.epi.org/blog/infrastructure-benefits/) seen a very interesting scenario where interest rates were negative, meaning that markets were willing to pay the government to spend money.\n\nFourthly, stimulus-funded employees ARE NOT PERMANENT. Using this example, let's say a stimulus project funds a construction company using borrowed money to be paid back in 5 years. The worker is directed to make improvements to a highly congested highway. The construction company is desperate for work and begins construction. It pays its employees and they spend that money in the economy, that money then gets spent and spent and spent. A local restaurant see that all these construction workers have money to spend, so they hire new employees to service the workers. These new employees then cause other businesses in the area to hire more and etc. The construction company purchased its supplies from a local steel mill, which hires new employees and productive capacity to supply the construction company. These employees contribute to the cyclical growth. When the government creates new consumers, it helps business.\n\nConstruction is finished in a year and the government ends the contract. The restaurant we saw earlier is booming, because of the new consumers and hires the construction company from earlier to increase the capacity of the restaurant. This is when economic growth becomes entirely independent of the government.\n\nThe new jobs means more people are paying taxes and the initial borrowed money to pay for the construction contract is paid off with interest, meaning all parties gained money and profited. This also means no one is trapped in a debt cycle.\n\nMeanwhile the newly improved road does not require future repair work and means the government has to spend less money on repairing the bridge. The less congested road allows for easier access to the restaurant and new customers allows it to flourish. The steel mill now has to pay less gas to bypass the congested highway and can afford to increased its productive capacity. Less congestion means the citizens are wasting less time in traffic and more time working in the economy. A particular pothole on the highway was repaired, meaning the local people no longer have to waste their precious paychecks fixing their vehicles that were damaged by the shotty roadwork that was present before. The new road makes the town more attractive and boosts local property values increasing the retail sector. The less congested road also contributes less to air pollution, saving health care costs, helping the local farmer, and making the people happier, further boosting property values.\n\nThe temporary spending by the government funded a prosperous and permanent growth in the economy. The debts were paid off and the people are happy, healthy, and well off.\n\n\nNow, let me ask you a single question. What can a dying private business do if there are no consumers?", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "selftext": "&gt; If a business does not have sufficient demand for its services or products, they will no longer be able to survive as a viable enterprise.

All his employees will lose their jobs. Are you saying the government should intervene and loan or grant Mr. Eight Track funding? I think not.\n\nI did not want to make this a referendum on the EPA. I merely picked them as an example of a government agency. I could have used Department of Energy or Transportation. However, that being said, the over-regulation by these government agencies clearly has an adverse effect of the economy. Please note I did not say no regulation.\n\nQuite often, a supposition will look good as an essay, but fundamentally fizzles in the real world. However, Keynesian economics is not one of those suppositions. It falls short both in theory and in real life.I was hoping to avoid the following little synopsis as it can get confusing and a little boring as well. But you have proven yourself a quite worthy opponent and I am running out of responses. Here it is:\n\nKeynes states that the Gross Domestic Product is equal to Consumption plus Investment plus Government Spending plus Net Exports (GDP=C+I+G+NX). So he assumes that if you increase any variable in the equation, the GDP will grow correspondingly. This is what his entire conclusions are centered on.  However, he routinely disregards the fact that plainly transferring wealth is not creating wealth, but rather just apportions it in another way. I will cite some illustrations of this sophistry.\nFirst, envision this: So in order to increase Government Spending (G), you have to increase taxes. Increasing taxes adds value to the variable  Taxes (T). Increasing Taxes means that Consumption (C) will decrease. That is inescapable\nSo the increase in G is offset by the decrease in C due to higher taxes. The GDP doesn\u2019t expand, it is just proportioned differently. A decrease in T (Taxes) has more of an effect on the economy than increasing G (Government spending) Why? Because consumers will only consume what they demand. We decide what has value. If we decide that iPhone 5\u2019s are more important to us than a parking ramp, iPhone 5\u2019s have more value. That\u2019s because only the consumers can choose what has value by demanding it.\nSo when G is increased, production may increase, but not necessarily production of something we demand. For example, if government spending is increased to pay for a parking ramp in the middle of a potato farm, is that good? No, because something was produced which has no value because it\u2019s not in demand. So government spending takes from consumers (the only people that can give value to something), and spends it on things which may not have value.\nEnvision this: According to this logic, shouldn\u2019t the government hire people to run around and damage things? If that was done, the government could spend the money to repair these things. It\u2019s an increase in G and also gives jobs to people. So shouldn\u2019t Keynes want that?\nOf course, the problem is that nothing was created with value. So it did not expand our wealth.\nAll sorts of issues arise when employment becomes an objective rather than a result. Keynesian economics is in large part a theory dedicated to fight unemployment. Since this is the case, all Keynesians are opposed to all technological advancements that make us more productive and successful, right? Of course, not, that would be absurd. But it would be entirely consistent for Keynesians to maintain that viewpoint.\nAnother thing to understand, is that an increase in C (Consumption) is not intrinsically good. This is especially true when NX (Net Exports) decreases when C is increased.\nFor example, if our nation imports 90% of its goods and services, our Net Exports (NX) will be negative, subtracting from our GDP. So what happens if our C increases by 50%? The -NX will increase enormously. So when we have a deficit in NX, when our C increases, the increase in C is offset by the decrease in NX.\nYou mentioned Keynes concept known as the \u201cMultiplier\u201d. The concept states that government spending is a more powerful tool of economic growth than letting the market consume. Assume that every consumer spends $0.75 out of every $1.00 they make. Keynes says that if the government spends $1,000,000 to \u201cstimulate\u201d the economy, you multiply it by a specific number. Let\u2019s say the multiplier is 4. So you multiply the government spending by whatever your multipler is. So in this case, it would be 4 x $1,000,000=$4,000,000. And POOF! That money taken from taxpayers just quadrupled.\nOf course, if you actually think this through, it\u2019s a ridiculous concept. As I mentioned before, the only way value can be added to a product, is through consumer demand, which only the consumers can decide. So when the government consumes, it is taking our money, and spending it on things not necessarily in demand. Since insignificant things are often produced, there is no growth. The only change, is that the consumer who add value to products, have less spending power because the government has taken it and spent it elsewhere.\nThe entire concept of a multiplier is a joke, yet admittedly it is still has a large following with the abundant left leaning economists that promulgate our universities.\nOur economic woes will continue if we do not forsake the ethos that the government can solve the economy by interfering and printing and/or borrowing money. \nOne last comment. You still have not been able to produce a clear cut example of a positive outcome for the Keynesian method. I hope you do not subscribe to the 2009 stimulus as a success. Its my example of its failure.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9jzfz8", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366595629", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9juxgp", "parent_id": "t1_c9juxdq", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431476868, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9juxgp", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366581830", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9juxdq", "parent_id": "t1_c9jtd1o", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431476869, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9juxdq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366581824", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "nonknower", "id": "t1_c9jtd1o", "parent_id": "t1_c9it8q5", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431477607, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think we both agree on one point for sure. That in order for the economic recovery to be bountiful and long lasting, we need more jobs. As stated in an earlier post, with our labor participation rate at its lowest levels in over 30 years, it is no wonder that the economy is mired in the mud. There are two schools of thought on how to fix the economy. It is evident that you subscribe to one set of ideals and I the other.\nYou believe an active government is the catalyst in propelling the economy. The government should step in and pass legislation to encourage employment. My feelings are that government (for the most part) needs to get out of the way in order for the private sector to create jobs. In order to determine which is the best course of action, we need to examine fundamental economic facts. It basically boils down to whether one believes that two similar jobs with equal pay, one in the public sector and one in the private sector are in fact equal. The cursory answer would be yes, they are the same. \nLet me extrapolate on a hypothetical example.\nGettin_Slizzard works in the IT department  for the Environmental Protection Agency. He earns 75k annually. He is able to buy food, pay his mortgage, run his car, educate his kids and maybe even purchase a new 65 inch big screen TV and go on a vacation to Disney World. Oh, and he also pays federal taxes just like everybody else.\n\nNonknower, who works in the IT Department in a private company, also gets paid a $75k salary. After paying his taxes he can also pay his mortgage, buy food, make his car payment, educate his kids and watch the Super Bowl on his new 65\" TV, and go visit Mickey Mouse with the family.\n\nSeemingly, both Getting_Slizzard and Nonknower have the same funds to spend on the same stuff. Thus, both jobs economically the same, correct?\n\nIf you go along with that assertion you could not be more mistaken. They are not alike economically. They are not in the same ballpark.\n\nNonknower works in the private sector. His efforts at work create a product that his employer sells into a market that, with free will, determines whether that product is good value or not. If Nonknower's employer is a smart entrepreneur, then there is value being created by Nonknower, and that value eventually translates into additional wealth that has been created. The additional wealth is shared by Nonknower's employer and his co-workers and indeed everybody who is along the productivity chain, from the providers of the raw material through to the salesman's commission. Not only is value and wealth created along that production chain, but because of Nonknower's ability to spend, it also occurs in every value chain that Nonknower spends his money on. This includes farmers, energy workers, car manufacturers and everywhere throughout the economy.\n\nNow, that all makes sense and is very logical but this is the key point that you should realize.\n\nNonknower's salary gets paid because the accumulated wealth of the world has increased in value. His salary does not get paid because someone else gets paid nothing, or less than they were getting. The ability to pay Nonknower's salary is 100% dependent on the ability of his employer to create wealth where it was not existing before. By the way, that wealth is usually called profit. Profit is not a bad word, it does not steal from the worker, or take from someone else...it is simply the creation of wealth.\n\nLet's contrast this with Gettin_Slizzard who holds a government job as a technician in a computer center. Gettin_Slizzard works just as hard as Nonknower, and actually does a valuable job, keeping the EPA computers safe from viruses. He doesn't actually create anything, and he is not part of a chain that produces a product that is sold to the private sector, but he does keep the EPA computers running smoothly.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, does not create any products that can be sold to the private sector either, but they do create regulations and employ an awful lot of people to support those regulations. There are many Gettin_Slizzard's, thus keeping unemployment down. After all, without the EPA creating precepts, Gettin_Slizzard would not have a job...but here he is earning his $75k salary, and not collecting unemployment.\n\nAnd of course, he takes his salary and spends it and that keeps entire value chains creating new wealth, so it is all good!\n\nNot quite. Since Gettin_Slizzard has to get paid, the government has no revenues or profits, so where does the money for Gettin_Slizzard's salary come from? It comes from one of three places. Taxation, printing money or borrowing money. There is no other way that Gettin_Slizzard can get paid.\n\nSo let's take a look at these three sources of Gettin_Slizzard's salary:\n \nTaxation\n\nIf Gettin_Slizzard did not have his job at the EPA, we would not have to pay $75k in taxes. If we did not have to pay a further $75k in taxes, it would be available to be spent on the value chain that creates additional wealth.\n\nSo...the fact that Gettin_Slizzard spends his salary on the value chain is not an argument since if Gettin_Slizzard did not have that job, you and I could spend that exact same amount of money on the value chain that creates wealth.\n\nGettin_Slizzard's salary as a government worker is nothing more than a \"circulation of capital\"....the government takes it from us and gives it to Gettin_Slizzard so he can spend it....it is the same money, just circulated in a different way.\n\nIf Gettin_Slizzard's job is paid for through taxation, it has zero effect on the economy. Sorry Gettin_Slizzard, your job makes no difference!!\n\nPrinting Money\n\nLet's make a simple assumption. The government was unable to tax us $75k more to pay for Gettin_Slizzard's job. The government knew that if it did that we would revolt and throw the bums out of office. We were not willing to pay any more tax so that Gettin_Slizzard could have a job.\n\nThe government still thinks they need Gettin_Slizzard to keep the computers at the EPA running, so they give him a job, and, since they are the government, simply print an extra $75k in notes that they can use for his salary. In fact, that is an even better deal for the economy because the Government is no longer simply circulating capital, but is increasing cash going into the economy because of the value that Gettin_Slizzard's job provides in building wealth.\n\nWell, this sounds good except for two things. The first is that Gettin_Slizzard's job does not create any wealth. And the second is that money that is simply printed and put into the economy does not change the world's accumulated wealth...it neither increases it nor decreases it. Because the world's wealth has not increased by the extra $75k the government has put into the economy, we have to ask what happened to it? Well, everyone who holds dollars finds out that their dollars are not worth as much as yesterday. Gettin_Slizzard's salary has come from the inflation of the dollar. This inflation means that everybody has less purchasing power...and cannot spend as much in the value chain of wealth creation.\n\nIn this case Gettin_Slizzard gets paid by reducing how much you can purchase with your money. This is the effect of inflation, which is used to pay Gettin_Slizzard's salary. Gettin_Slizzard has created no new wealth, and Gettin_Slizzard's salary has contributed no more to economic wealth than if he did not have the job at all. This again, is simply circulation of capital and cannot in any way create wealth and grow the economy. Sorry Gettin_Slizzard...your job is not looking real good right now...maybe if the government borrowed?\n\nGovernment Borrowing\n\nSo, the government cannot increase taxation or simply print money to pay for Gettin_Slizzard's salary.\n\nTheir final option is to borrow some money from another country and use that to pay Gettin_Slizzard. So the American bankers hop on a Lear Jet to Beijing and tell the Chinese...lend us $75k to pay Gettin_Slizzard, and next year we will pay you back $80k. The Chinese accept this deal....at the end of the day, with the full faith and credit of the United States Government, a mere $75k loan is very easy to do.\n\nSo, the Bankers come back with $75k in their attache cases and give that to Gettin_Slizzard for his beneficial labor at the EPA.\n\nGettin_Slizzard spends that money in exactly the same way as Nonknower. But the economy doesn't change...why? Because the sheer borrowing of money does not create new wealth. The introduction of the $75k from China has established precisly the same inflation as if the money had simply been printed in the first place.\n\nSo...the problem is that this is no different than the outcome of printing money. Simply a circulation of capital!\n\nBut it becomes more distressing..\n\nAmerica has to pay China back...and since the government has no money of its own, it has three choices. Raise taxes, print money, or borrow money.\n\nCan you see a pattern developing? When we borrow money to pay Gettin_Slizzard, we find ourselves in a never ending cycle of  higher taxes, inflation and growing debt. This unsound economic structure will eventually come crashing down.\n\nI think the above examples show exactly the reason why Keynesian policies have never, and will never succeed in improving the economy in a healthy and sustained manner.\n\n", "edited": 1366586391, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9jtd1o", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366577110", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9it8q5", "parent_id": "t1_c9is8uu", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431495114, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9it8q5", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366419298", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "nonknower", "id": "t1_c9is8uu", "parent_id": "t1_c9i3dvk", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431495583, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Huge growth in spending and deficits, increase the prospect of future tax increases. Many people realize that increased spending must be paid for sooner or later. Concern over future tax rates is one of the main reasons for heightened uncertainty and reduced confidence. Most of the government spending programs redistribute income from workers to the unemployed. This, Keynesians stress, increases the betterment of many hurt by the recession. What their models disregard, however, is the reduced productivity that follows a shift of resources toward redistribution and away from productive investment. Keynesian theory argues that each dollar of government spending has a larger effect on output than a dollar of tax reduction. But in reality the reverse has proven true. Permanent tax reduction generates more expansion than increased government spending of the same dollars. The resulting difference in productivity is a main reason for the difference in results.  Keynesian models ignore the adverse effects of the costly regulations that stream out of the bureaucracy. We also have an overzealous group of financial regulators, guardians of unions, and environmental regulators . Their determinations increase future costs and breed uneasiness. How can corporate executives approximate future return on new investment when tax rates and costs are mystifying? Holding cash and waiting for less uncertainty is the predominant reaction. Hence, the \"economic recovery\" dawdles. Job creation in March was a sad 88,000. The labor particpation rate is the lowest since Jimmy Carter was President http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/04/07/march-labor-force-participation/2057887/.\nCurrent American monetary policies are primarily aimed at getting short term result. A conservative estimate of the cost of new jobs produced from the stimulus bill is at least $170,000 per job http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/nbrnberwo/16759.htm . How can that please taxpayers who will assume those costs? Once the funding ends, the jobs vanish, but the bonds that financed them remain and must be satisfied. These medium and long-term results are discounted in Keynesian paradigms. Noticeably, a more proficient fiscal policy would bring back the long-term growth rate by diminishing uncertainty and restoring corporate and consumer confidence. The singular rationale that Keynesian economics model has persisted is  not because it works, but because it justifies what liberal politicians do.

My feelings are that government (for the most part) needs to get out of the way in order for the private sector to create jobs.\n\nThis is a misrepresentation of what I believe. I believe, backed by strong evidence, that there are scenarios where the private sector is risk-adverse to hiring new employees and boosting productivity. I think the government's role in the economy at this point is to get the private sector to hire again. This can happen through either supply or demand. If supply is the problem, then the company is short on cash to hire more people and corporate tax cuts, loans, cash infusions, etc would allow the company to hire more people. \n\nIf demand is the problem, then the problem is that there are not enough consumers. This cannot be fixed independently by the private sector. At this point it is the government's responsibility to directly hire employees who will become consumers of private sector goods, allowing the private sector to flourish.\n\n&gt;Let's contrast this with Gettin_Slizzard who holds a government job as a technician in a computer center. Gettin_Slizzard works just as hard as Nonknower, and actually does a valuable job, keeping the EPA computers safe from viruses. He doesn't actually create anything, and he is not part of a chain that produces a product that is sold to the private sector, but he does keep the EPA computers running smoothly.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, does not create any products that can be sold to the private sector either, but they do create regulations and employ an awful lot of people to support those regulations. There are many Gettin_Slizzard's, thus keeping unemployment down. After all, without the EPA creating precepts, Gettin_Slizzard would not have a job...but here he is earning his $75k salary, and not collecting unemployment.\n\nThis is misleading for a few reasons\n\nFirst, the EPA's purpose is NOT an economic one, but an environmental one. It's goal is NOT to provide employment, but to protect the environment. \n\nSecond, I do not support regulatory action as stimulus. Of course it doesnt boost the economy.\n\nThirdly, the EPA does provide a service that benefits the economy. The EPA is part of a critical economic chain. It provides environmental capital. While overregulation can be a problem, it is wrong to completely dismiss certain economic benefits of SOME regulation. Pollution may degrade air quality and drain the economy because of increased health care spending or declining agricultural productivity. Overfishing provides short-run economic benefits, but dooms ocean ecosystems in the long-run, which even from a purely economic perspective is bad. This ignores direct harm to the public.  \n \nLet's look at a more tangible public service that is less abstract than the EPA and has a more direct impact on the economy. Building of infrastructure is something that the private sector rarely does, because of its high initial capital costs. But free and accessible public transportation and electricity systems provided by the government reduce the costs of operating a business. They also provide for the public good.\n\nIn the case of infrastructure, even assuming it was completely funded by taxes, it is best for the economy in the long-term, because it decreases the cost of living, operating businesses, etc.\n\nThe government has a purpose other than promoting the economy. Promoting the well-being of its citizens by protecting the health and security of them. These must be weighed against potential economic effects. \n\n&gt;So...the fact that Gettin_Slizzard spends his salary on the value chain is not an argument since if Gettin_Slizzard did not have that job, you and I could spend that exact same amount of money on the value chain that creates wealth.\n\nWell actually, this is a concept known as the multiplier effect and it applies to both private and public sector spending.\n\n\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "selftext": "&gt;Gettin_Slizzard's salary as a government worker is nothing more than a \"circulation of capital\"....the government takes it from us and gives it to Gettin_Slizzard so he can spend it....it is the same money, just circulated in a different way.\nIf Gettin_Slizzard's job is paid for through taxation, it has zero effect on the economy.

This inflation means that everybody has less purchasing power...and cannot spend as much in the value chain of wealth creation\n\nThis isn't exactly true. Inflation is the rise in price for goods and services, for one thing if the gov printed $75k to pay for my job, it would be imperceptible by markets as a share of the total money supply. If the money supply is $1.18 tr, businesses simply cannot charge .000063% more for goods and services. It is ludicrous.\n\nAlso, [this](http://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2011/05/14/money-growth-does-not-cause-inflation/) article is great at explaining the cause of inflation. \n\n&gt; Their final option is to borrow some money from another country and use that to pay Gettin_Slizzard.

The Chinese like this deal....after all, with the full faith and credit of the United States Government, a mere $75k loan is very easy to do.\nSo, the Bankers come back with $75k in fresh US $100 bills stuffing their pockets and give that to Gettin_Slizzard for his valuable work at the EPA.\nGettin_Slizzard spends that money in exactly the same way as Nonknower. But the economy doesn't change...why? Because the mere borrowing of money does not create new wealth. The inflow of the $75k from China has created exactly the same inflation as if the money had simply been printed in the first place.\nSo...the problem is that this is no different than the impact of printing money. Simply a circulation of capital!\nBut it becomes more distressing..\nAmerica has to pay China back...and since the government has no money of its own, it has three choices. Raise taxes, print money, or borrow money.\nCan you see a pattern developing? When we borrow money to pay Gettin_Slizzard, we find ourselves in a never ending cycle of higher taxes, inflation and growing debt. This unsound economic structure will eventually come crashing down.\n\nFirst, the vast majority of borrowed money comes from US citizens, which means they weren't investing that money in the first place. Though, there is a possibility of a crowd-out effect, it rarely overwhelms the stimulative effect of borrowed stimulus.\n\nSecond, it is not inflation, because it is a method of creating wealth without printing any money. It is an exchange of spending now for spending later. \n\nThirdly, this assumes positive interest rates. While this is normally the case, we have [recently](http://www.epi.org/blog/infrastructure-benefits/) seen a very interesting scenario where interest rates were negative, meaning that markets were willing to pay the government to spend money.\n\nFourthly, stimulus-funded employees ARE NOT PERMANENT. Using this example, let's say a stimulus project funds a construction company using borrowed money to be paid back in 5 years. The worker is directed to make improvements to a highly congested highway. The construction company is desperate for work and begins construction. It pays its employees and they spend that money in the economy, that money then gets spent and spent and spent. A local restaurant see that all these construction workers have money to spend, so they hire new employees to service the workers. These new employees then cause other businesses in the area to hire more and etc. The construction company purchased its supplies from a local steel mill, which hires new employees and productive capacity to supply the construction company. These employees contribute to the cyclical growth. When the government creates new consumers, it helps business.\n\nConstruction is finished in a year and the government ends the contract. The restaurant we saw earlier is booming, because of the new consumers and hires the construction company from earlier to increase the capacity of the restaurant. This is when economic growth becomes entirely independent of the government.\n\nThe new jobs means more people are paying taxes and the initial borrowed money to pay for the construction contract is paid off with interest, meaning all parties gained money and profited. This also means no one is trapped in a debt cycle.\n\nMeanwhile the newly improved road does not require future repair work and means the government has to spend less money on repairing the bridge. The less congested road allows for easier access to the restaurant and new customers allows it to flourish. The steel mill now has to pay less gas to bypass the congested highway and can afford to increased its productive capacity. Less congestion means the citizens are wasting less time in traffic and more time working in the economy. A particular pothole on the highway was repaired, meaning the local people no longer have to waste their precious paychecks fixing their vehicles that were damaged by the shotty roadwork that was present before. The new road makes the town more attractive and boosts local property values increasing the retail sector. The less congested road also contributes less to air pollution, saving health care costs, helping the local farmer, and making the people happier, further boosting property values.\n\nThe temporary spending by the government funded a prosperous and permanent growth in the economy. The debts were paid off and the people are happy, healthy, and well off.\n\n\nNow, let me ask you a single question.

I merely picked them as an example of a government agency. I could have used Department of Energy or Transportation. However, that being said, the over-regulation by these government agencies clearly has an adverse effect of the economy. Please note I did not say no regulation.\n\nQuite often, a supposition will look good as an essay, but fundamentally fizzles in the real world. However, Keynesian economics is not one of those suppositions. It falls short both in theory and in real life.I was hoping to avoid the following little synopsis as it can get confusing and a little boring as well. But you have proven yourself a quite worthy opponent and I am running out of responses. Here it is:\n\nKeynes states that the Gross Domestic Product is equal to Consumption plus Investment plus Government Spending plus Net Exports (GDP=C+I+G+NX). So he assumes that if you increase any variable in the equation, the GDP will grow correspondingly. This is what his entire conclusions are centered on.  However, he routinely disregards the fact that plainly transferring wealth is not creating wealth, but rather just apportions it in another way. I will cite some illustrations of this sophistry.\nFirst, envision this: So in order to increase Government Spending (G), you have to increase taxes. Increasing taxes adds value to the variable  Taxes (T). Increasing Taxes means that Consumption (C) will decrease. That is inescapable\nSo the increase in G is offset by the decrease in C due to higher taxes. The GDP doesn\u2019t expand, it is just proportioned differently. A decrease in T (Taxes) has more of an effect on the economy than increasing G (Government spending) Why? Because consumers will only consume what they demand. We decide what has value. If we decide that iPhone 5\u2019s are more important to us than a parking ramp, iPhone 5\u2019s have more value. That\u2019s because only the consumers can choose what has value by demanding it.\nSo when G is increased, production may increase, but not necessarily production of something we demand. For example, if government spending is increased to pay for a parking ramp in the middle of a potato farm, is that good? No, because something was produced which has no value because it\u2019s not in demand. So government spending takes from consumers (the only people that can give value to something), and spends it on things which may not have value.\nEnvision this: According to this logic, shouldn\u2019t the government hire people to run around and damage things? If that was done, the government could spend the money to repair these things. It\u2019s an increase in G and also gives jobs to people. So shouldn\u2019t Keynes want that?\nOf course, the problem is that nothing was created with value. So it did not expand our wealth.\nAll sorts of issues arise when employment becomes an objective rather than a result. Keynesian economics is in large part a theory dedicated to fight unemployment. Since this is the case, all Keynesians are opposed to all technological advancements that make us more productive and successful, right? Of course, not, that would be absurd. But it would be entirely consistent for Keynesians to maintain that viewpoint.\nAnother thing to understand, is that an increase in C (Consumption) is not intrinsically good. This is especially true when NX (Net Exports) decreases when C is increased.\nFor example, if our nation imports 90% of its goods and services, our Net Exports (NX) will be negative, subtracting from our GDP. So what happens if our C increases by 50%? The -NX will increase enormously. So when we have a deficit in NX, when our C increases, the increase in C is offset by the decrease in NX.\nYou mentioned Keynes concept known as the \u201cMultiplier\u201d. The concept states that government spending is a more powerful tool of economic growth than letting the market consume. Assume that every consumer spends $0.75 out of every $1.00 they make. Keynes says that if the government spends $1,000,000 to \u201cstimulate\u201d the economy, you multiply it by a specific number. Let\u2019s say the multiplier is 4. So you multiply the government spending by whatever your multipler is. So in this case, it would be 4 x $1,000,000=$4,000,000. And POOF! That money taken from taxpayers just quadrupled.\nOf course, if you actually think this through, it\u2019s a ridiculous concept. As I mentioned before, the only way value can be added to a product, is through consumer demand, which only the consumers can decide. So when the government consumes, it is taking our money, and spending it on things not necessarily in demand. Since insignificant things are often produced, there is no growth. The only change, is that the consumer who add value to products, have less spending power because the government has taken it and spent it elsewhere.\nThe entire concept of a multiplier is a joke, yet admittedly it is still has a large following with the abundant left leaning economists that promulgate our universities.\nOur economic woes will continue if we do not forsake the ethos that the government can solve the economy by interfering and printing and/or borrowing money. \nOne last comment. You still have not been able to produce a clear cut example of a positive outcome for the Keynesian method. I hope you do not subscribe to the 2009 stimulus as a success. Its my example of its failure.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9jzfz8", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366595629", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9juxgp", "parent_id": "t1_c9juxdq", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431476868, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9juxgp", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366581830", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9juxdq", "parent_id": "t1_c9jtd1o", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431476869, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9juxdq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366581824", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "nonknower", "id": "t1_c9jtd1o", "parent_id": "t1_c9it8q5", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431477607, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think we both agree on one point for sure. That in order for the economic recovery to be bountiful and long lasting, we need more jobs. As stated in an earlier post, with our labor participation rate at its lowest levels in over 30 years, it is no wonder that the economy is mired in the mud. There are two schools of thought on how to fix the economy. It is evident that you subscribe to one set of ideals and I the other.\nYou believe an active government is the catalyst in propelling the economy. The government should step in and pass legislation to encourage employment. My feelings are that government (for the most part) needs to get out of the way in order for the private sector to create jobs. In order to determine which is the best course of action, we need to examine fundamental economic facts. It basically boils down to whether one believes that two similar jobs with equal pay, one in the public sector and one in the private sector are in fact equal. The cursory answer would be yes, they are the same. \nLet me extrapolate on a hypothetical example.\nGettin_Slizzard works in the IT department  for the Environmental Protection Agency. He earns 75k annually. He is able to buy food, pay his mortgage, run his car, educate his kids and maybe even purchase a new 65 inch big screen TV and go on a vacation to Disney World. Oh, and he also pays federal taxes just like everybody else.\n\nNonknower, who works in the IT Department in a private company, also gets paid a $75k salary. After paying his taxes he can also pay his mortgage, buy food, make his car payment, educate his kids and watch the Super Bowl on his new 65\" TV, and go visit Mickey Mouse with the family.\n\nSeemingly, both Getting_Slizzard and Nonknower have the same funds to spend on the same stuff. Thus, both jobs economically the same, correct?\n\nIf you go along with that assertion you could not be more mistaken. They are not alike economically. They are not in the same ballpark.\n\nNonknower works in the private sector. His efforts at work create a product that his employer sells into a market that, with free will, determines whether that product is good value or not. If Nonknower's employer is a smart entrepreneur, then there is value being created by Nonknower, and that value eventually translates into additional wealth that has been created. The additional wealth is shared by Nonknower's employer and his co-workers and indeed everybody who is along the productivity chain, from the providers of the raw material through to the salesman's commission. Not only is value and wealth created along that production chain, but because of Nonknower's ability to spend, it also occurs in every value chain that Nonknower spends his money on. This includes farmers, energy workers, car manufacturers and everywhere throughout the economy.\n\nNow, that all makes sense and is very logical but this is the key point that you should realize.\n\nNonknower's salary gets paid because the accumulated wealth of the world has increased in value. His salary does not get paid because someone else gets paid nothing, or less than they were getting. The ability to pay Nonknower's salary is 100% dependent on the ability of his employer to create wealth where it was not existing before. By the way, that wealth is usually called profit. Profit is not a bad word, it does not steal from the worker, or take from someone else...it is simply the creation of wealth.\n\nLet's contrast this with Gettin_Slizzard who holds a government job as a technician in a computer center. Gettin_Slizzard works just as hard as Nonknower, and actually does a valuable job, keeping the EPA computers safe from viruses. He doesn't actually create anything, and he is not part of a chain that produces a product that is sold to the private sector, but he does keep the EPA computers running smoothly.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, does not create any products that can be sold to the private sector either, but they do create regulations and employ an awful lot of people to support those regulations. There are many Gettin_Slizzard's, thus keeping unemployment down. After all, without the EPA creating precepts, Gettin_Slizzard would not have a job...but here he is earning his $75k salary, and not collecting unemployment.\n\nAnd of course, he takes his salary and spends it and that keeps entire value chains creating new wealth, so it is all good!\n\nNot quite. Since Gettin_Slizzard has to get paid, the government has no revenues or profits, so where does the money for Gettin_Slizzard's salary come from? It comes from one of three places. Taxation, printing money or borrowing money. There is no other way that Gettin_Slizzard can get paid.\n\nSo let's take a look at these three sources of Gettin_Slizzard's salary:\n \nTaxation\n\nIf Gettin_Slizzard did not have his job at the EPA, we would not have to pay $75k in taxes. If we did not have to pay a further $75k in taxes, it would be available to be spent on the value chain that creates additional wealth.\n\nSo...the fact that Gettin_Slizzard spends his salary on the value chain is not an argument since if Gettin_Slizzard did not have that job, you and I could spend that exact same amount of money on the value chain that creates wealth.\n\nGettin_Slizzard's salary as a government worker is nothing more than a \"circulation of capital\"....the government takes it from us and gives it to Gettin_Slizzard so he can spend it....it is the same money, just circulated in a different way.\n\nIf Gettin_Slizzard's job is paid for through taxation, it has zero effect on the economy. Sorry Gettin_Slizzard, your job makes no difference!!\n\nPrinting Money\n\nLet's make a simple assumption. The government was unable to tax us $75k more to pay for Gettin_Slizzard's job. The government knew that if it did that we would revolt and throw the bums out of office. We were not willing to pay any more tax so that Gettin_Slizzard could have a job.\n\nThe government still thinks they need Gettin_Slizzard to keep the computers at the EPA running, so they give him a job, and, since they are the government, simply print an extra $75k in notes that they can use for his salary. In fact, that is an even better deal for the economy because the Government is no longer simply circulating capital, but is increasing cash going into the economy because of the value that Gettin_Slizzard's job provides in building wealth.\n\nWell, this sounds good except for two things. The first is that Gettin_Slizzard's job does not create any wealth. And the second is that money that is simply printed and put into the economy does not change the world's accumulated wealth...it neither increases it nor decreases it. Because the world's wealth has not increased by the extra $75k the government has put into the economy, we have to ask what happened to it? Well, everyone who holds dollars finds out that their dollars are not worth as much as yesterday. Gettin_Slizzard's salary has come from the inflation of the dollar. This inflation means that everybody has less purchasing power...and cannot spend as much in the value chain of wealth creation.\n\nIn this case Gettin_Slizzard gets paid by reducing how much you can purchase with your money. This is the effect of inflation, which is used to pay Gettin_Slizzard's salary. Gettin_Slizzard has created no new wealth, and Gettin_Slizzard's salary has contributed no more to economic wealth than if he did not have the job at all. This again, is simply circulation of capital and cannot in any way create wealth and grow the economy. Sorry Gettin_Slizzard...your job is not looking real good right now...maybe if the government borrowed?\n\nGovernment Borrowing\n\nSo, the government cannot increase taxation or simply print money to pay for Gettin_Slizzard's salary.\n\nTheir final option is to borrow some money from another country and use that to pay Gettin_Slizzard. So the American bankers hop on a Lear Jet to Beijing and tell the Chinese...lend us $75k to pay Gettin_Slizzard, and next year we will pay you back $80k. The Chinese accept this deal....at the end of the day, with the full faith and credit of the United States Government, a mere $75k loan is very easy to do.\n\nSo, the Bankers come back with $75k in their attache cases and give that to Gettin_Slizzard for his beneficial labor at the EPA.\n\nGettin_Slizzard spends that money in exactly the same way as Nonknower. But the economy doesn't change...why? Because the sheer borrowing of money does not create new wealth. The introduction of the $75k from China has established precisly the same inflation as if the money had simply been printed in the first place.\n\nSo...the problem is that this is no different than the outcome of printing money. Simply a circulation of capital!\n\nBut it becomes more distressing..\n\nAmerica has to pay China back...and since the government has no money of its own, it has three choices. Raise taxes, print money, or borrow money.\n\nCan you see a pattern developing? When we borrow money to pay Gettin_Slizzard, we find ourselves in a never ending cycle of  higher taxes, inflation and growing debt. This unsound economic structure will eventually come crashing down.\n\nI think the above examples show exactly the reason why Keynesian policies have never, and will never succeed in improving the economy in a healthy and sustained manner.\n\n", "edited": 1366586391, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9jtd1o", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366577110", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9it8q5", "parent_id": "t1_c9is8uu", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431495114, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9it8q5", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366419298", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "nonknower", "id": "t1_c9is8uu", "parent_id": "t1_c9i3dvk", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431495583, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Huge growth in spending and deficits, increase the prospect of future tax increases. Many people realize that increased spending must be paid for sooner or later. Concern over future tax rates is one of the main reasons for heightened uncertainty and reduced confidence. Most of the government spending programs redistribute income from workers to the unemployed. This, Keynesians stress, increases the betterment of many hurt by the recession. What their models disregard, however, is the reduced productivity that follows a shift of resources toward redistribution and away from productive investment. Keynesian theory argues that each dollar of government spending has a larger effect on output than a dollar of tax reduction. But in reality the reverse has proven true. Permanent tax reduction generates more expansion than increased government spending of the same dollars. The resulting difference in productivity is a main reason for the difference in results.  Keynesian models ignore the adverse effects of the costly regulations that stream out of the bureaucracy. We also have an overzealous group of financial regulators, guardians of unions, and environmental regulators . Their determinations increase future costs and breed uneasiness. How can corporate executives approximate future return on new investment when tax rates and costs are mystifying? Holding cash and waiting for less uncertainty is the predominant reaction. Hence, the \"economic recovery\" dawdles. Job creation in March was a sad 88,000. The labor particpation rate is the lowest since Jimmy Carter was President http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/04/07/march-labor-force-participation/2057887/.\nCurrent American monetary policies are primarily aimed at getting short term result. A conservative estimate of the cost of new jobs produced from the stimulus bill is at least $170,000 per job http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/nbrnberwo/16759.htm . How can that please taxpayers who will assume those costs? Once the funding ends, the jobs vanish, but the bonds that financed them remain and must be satisfied. These medium and long-term results are discounted in Keynesian paradigms. Noticeably, a more proficient fiscal policy would bring back the long-term growth rate by diminishing uncertainty and restoring corporate and consumer confidence.

That private sector growth is what creates employment after the stimulus funds end. \n\nThere is little evidence that supply is the main problem with our economy, most analysis' of stimulus conclude that it was worth it, and I only support running high deficits in times of low demand. My problem with your analysis is that it assumes all the worst without even conceding the most minor of points, like the possibility that the economy needs more consumers for the private sector to hire anyone.

The government should step in and pass legislation to encourage employment. My feelings are that government (for the most part) needs to get out of the way in order for the private sector to create jobs.\n\nThis is a misrepresentation of what I believe. I believe, backed by strong evidence, that there are scenarios where the private sector is risk-adverse to hiring new employees and boosting productivity. I think the government's role in the economy at this point is to get the private sector to hire again. This can happen through either supply or demand. If supply is the problem, then the company is short on cash to hire more people and corporate tax cuts, loans, cash infusions, etc would allow the company to hire more people. \n\nIf demand is the problem, then the problem is that there are not enough consumers. This cannot be fixed independently by the private sector. At this point it is the government's responsibility to directly hire employees who will become consumers of private sector goods, allowing the private sector to flourish.\n\n&gt;Let's contrast this with Gettin_Slizzard who holds a government job as a technician in a computer center. Gettin_Slizzard works just as hard as Nonknower, and actually does a valuable job, keeping the EPA computers safe from viruses. He doesn't actually create anything, and he is not part of a chain that produces a product that is sold to the private sector, but he does keep the EPA computers running smoothly.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, does not create any products that can be sold to the private sector either, but they do create regulations and employ an awful lot of people to support those regulations. There are many Gettin_Slizzard's, thus keeping unemployment down. After all, without the EPA creating precepts, Gettin_Slizzard would not have a job...but here he is earning his $75k salary, and not collecting unemployment.\n\nThis is misleading for a few reasons\n\nFirst, the EPA's purpose is NOT an economic one, but an environmental one. It's goal is NOT to provide employment, but to protect the environment. \n\nSecond, I do not support regulatory action as stimulus. Of course it doesnt boost the economy.\n\nThirdly, the EPA does provide a service that benefits the economy. The EPA is part of a critical economic chain. It provides environmental capital. While overregulation can be a problem, it is wrong to completely dismiss certain economic benefits of SOME regulation. Pollution may degrade air quality and drain the economy because of increased health care spending or declining agricultural productivity. Overfishing provides short-run economic benefits, but dooms ocean ecosystems in the long-run, which even from a purely economic perspective is bad. This ignores direct harm to the public.  \n \nLet's look at a more tangible public service that is less abstract than the EPA and has a more direct impact on the economy. Building of infrastructure is something that the private sector rarely does, because of its high initial capital costs. But free and accessible public transportation and electricity systems provided by the government reduce the costs of operating a business. They also provide for the public good.\n\nIn the case of infrastructure, even assuming it was completely funded by taxes, it is best for the economy in the long-term, because it decreases the cost of living, operating businesses, etc.\n\nThe government has a purpose other than promoting the economy. Promoting the well-being of its citizens by protecting the health and security of them. These must be weighed against potential economic effects. \n\n&gt;So...the fact that Gettin_Slizzard spends his salary on the value chain is not an argument since if Gettin_Slizzard did not have that job, you and I could spend that exact same amount of money on the value chain that creates wealth.\n\nWell actually, this is a concept known as the multiplier effect and it applies to both private and public sector spending.\n\n\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "selftext": "&gt;Gettin_Slizzard's salary as a government worker is nothing more than a \"circulation of capital\"....the government takes it from us and gives it to Gettin_Slizzard so he can spend it....it is the same money, just circulated in a different way.\nIf Gettin_Slizzard's job is paid for through taxation, it has zero effect on the economy. Sorry Gettin_Slizzard, your job makes no difference!!\n\nWhile it is true in the case of taxation that the money must first be taken out of the economy and therefore the stimulative effect will be reduced, it's important to note the goals of stimulus.\n\nBorrowing does not suffer from the same problems, but more of that later. \n\nIt is to create new consumers so the private sector will hire more employees to service these consumers.\n\n&gt; money that is simply printed and put into the economy does not change the world's accumulated wealth...it neither increases it nor decreases it. Because the world's wealth has not increased by the extra $75k the government has put into the economy, we have to ask what happened to it? Well, everyone who holds dollars finds out that their dollars are not worth as much as yesterday. Gettin_Slizzard's salary has come from the inflation of the dollar. This inflation means that everybody has less purchasing power...and cannot spend as much in the value chain of wealth creation\n\nThis isn't exactly true. Inflation is the rise in price for goods and services, for one thing if the gov printed $75k to pay for my job, it would be imperceptible by markets as a share of the total money supply. If the money supply is $1.18 tr, businesses simply cannot charge .000063% more for goods and services. It is ludicrous.\n\nAlso, [this](http://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2011/05/14/money-growth-does-not-cause-inflation/) article is great at explaining the cause of inflation. \n\n&gt; Their final option is to borrow some money from another country and use that to pay Gettin_Slizzard. So the American bankers jump on a plane and fly to China and tell the Chinese...lend us $75k to pay Gettin_Slizzard, and next year we will you back $80k, ok? The Chinese like this deal....after all, with the full faith and credit of the United States Government, a mere $75k loan is very easy to do.\nSo, the Bankers come back with $75k in fresh US $100 bills stuffing their pockets and give that to Gettin_Slizzard for his valuable work at the EPA.\nGettin_Slizzard spends that money in exactly the same way as Nonknower. But the economy doesn't change...why? Because the mere borrowing of money does not create new wealth. The inflow of the $75k from China has created exactly the same inflation as if the money had simply been printed in the first place.\nSo...the problem is that this is no different than the impact of printing money. Simply a circulation of capital!\nBut it becomes more distressing..\nAmerica has to pay China back...and since the government has no money of its own, it has three choices. Raise taxes, print money, or borrow money.\nCan you see a pattern developing? When we borrow money to pay Gettin_Slizzard, we find ourselves in a never ending cycle of higher taxes, inflation and growing debt. This unsound economic structure will eventually come crashing down.\n\nFirst, the vast majority of borrowed money comes from US citizens, which means they weren't investing that money in the first place. Though, there is a possibility of a crowd-out effect, it rarely overwhelms the stimulative effect of borrowed stimulus.\n\nSecond, it is not inflation, because it is a method of creating wealth without printing any money. It is an exchange of spending now for spending later. \n\nThirdly, this assumes positive interest rates. While this is normally the case, we have [recently](http://www.epi.org/blog/infrastructure-benefits/) seen a very interesting scenario where interest rates were negative, meaning that markets were willing to pay the government to spend money.\n\nFourthly, stimulus-funded employees ARE NOT PERMANENT. Using this example, let's say a stimulus project funds a construction company using borrowed money to be paid back in 5 years. The worker is directed to make improvements to a highly congested highway. The construction company is desperate for work and begins construction. It pays its employees and they spend that money in the economy, that money then gets spent and spent and spent. A local restaurant see that all these construction workers have money to spend, so they hire new employees to service the workers. These new employees then cause other businesses in the area to hire more and etc. The construction company purchased its supplies from a local steel mill, which hires new employees and productive capacity to supply the construction company. These employees contribute to the cyclical growth. When the government creates new consumers, it helps business.\n\nConstruction is finished in a year and the government ends the contract. The restaurant we saw earlier is booming, because of the new consumers and hires the construction company from earlier to increase the capacity of the restaurant. This is when economic growth becomes entirely independent of the government.\n\nThe new jobs means more people are paying taxes and the initial borrowed money to pay for the construction contract is paid off with interest, meaning all parties gained money and profited. This also means no one is trapped in a debt cycle.\n\nMeanwhile the newly improved road does not require future repair work and means the government has to spend less money on repairing the bridge. The less congested road allows for easier access to the restaurant and new customers allows it to flourish. The steel mill now has to pay less gas to bypass the congested highway and can afford to increased its productive capacity. Less congestion means the citizens are wasting less time in traffic and more time working in the economy. A particular pothole on the highway was repaired, meaning the local people no longer have to waste their precious paychecks fixing their vehicles that were damaged by the shotty roadwork that was present before. The new road makes the town more attractive and boosts local property values increasing the retail sector. The less congested road also contributes less to air pollution, saving health care costs, helping the local farmer, and making the people happier, further boosting property values.\n\nThe temporary spending by the government funded a prosperous and permanent growth in the economy. The debts were paid off and the people are happy, healthy, and well off.\n\n\nNow, let me ask you a single question.

I merely picked them as an example of a government agency. I could have used Department of Energy or Transportation. However, that being said, the over-regulation by these government agencies clearly has an adverse effect of the economy. Please note I did not say no regulation.\n\nQuite often, a supposition will look good as an essay, but fundamentally fizzles in the real world. However, Keynesian economics is not one of those suppositions. It falls short both in theory and in real life.I was hoping to avoid the following little synopsis as it can get confusing and a little boring as well. But you have proven yourself a quite worthy opponent and I am running out of responses. Here it is:\n\nKeynes states that the Gross Domestic Product is equal to Consumption plus Investment plus Government Spending plus Net Exports (GDP=C+I+G+NX). So he assumes that if you increase any variable in the equation, the GDP will grow correspondingly. This is what his entire conclusions are centered on.  However, he routinely disregards the fact that plainly transferring wealth is not creating wealth, but rather just apportions it in another way. I will cite some illustrations of this sophistry.\nFirst, envision this: So in order to increase Government Spending (G), you have to increase taxes. Increasing taxes adds value to the variable  Taxes (T). Increasing Taxes means that Consumption (C) will decrease. That is inescapable\nSo the increase in G is offset by the decrease in C due to higher taxes. The GDP doesn\u2019t expand, it is just proportioned differently. A decrease in T (Taxes) has more of an effect on the economy than increasing G (Government spending) Why? Because consumers will only consume what they demand. We decide what has value. If we decide that iPhone 5\u2019s are more important to us than a parking ramp, iPhone 5\u2019s have more value. That\u2019s because only the consumers can choose what has value by demanding it.\nSo when G is increased, production may increase, but not necessarily production of something we demand. For example, if government spending is increased to pay for a parking ramp in the middle of a potato farm, is that good? No, because something was produced which has no value because it\u2019s not in demand. So government spending takes from consumers (the only people that can give value to something), and spends it on things which may not have value.\nEnvision this: According to this logic, shouldn\u2019t the government hire people to run around and damage things? If that was done, the government could spend the money to repair these things. It\u2019s an increase in G and also gives jobs to people. So shouldn\u2019t Keynes want that?\nOf course, the problem is that nothing was created with value. So it did not expand our wealth.\nAll sorts of issues arise when employment becomes an objective rather than a result. Keynesian economics is in large part a theory dedicated to fight unemployment. Since this is the case, all Keynesians are opposed to all technological advancements that make us more productive and successful, right? Of course, not, that would be absurd. But it would be entirely consistent for Keynesians to maintain that viewpoint.\nAnother thing to understand, is that an increase in C (Consumption) is not intrinsically good. This is especially true when NX (Net Exports) decreases when C is increased.\nFor example, if our nation imports 90% of its goods and services, our Net Exports (NX) will be negative, subtracting from our GDP. So what happens if our C increases by 50%? The -NX will increase enormously. So when we have a deficit in NX, when our C increases, the increase in C is offset by the decrease in NX.\nYou mentioned Keynes concept known as the \u201cMultiplier\u201d. The concept states that government spending is a more powerful tool of economic growth than letting the market consume. Assume that every consumer spends $0.75 out of every $1.00 they make. Keynes says that if the government spends $1,000,000 to \u201cstimulate\u201d the economy, you multiply it by a specific number. Let\u2019s say the multiplier is 4. So you multiply the government spending by whatever your multipler is. So in this case, it would be 4 x $1,000,000=$4,000,000. And POOF! That money taken from taxpayers just quadrupled.\nOf course, if you actually think this through, it\u2019s a ridiculous concept. As I mentioned before, the only way value can be added to a product, is through consumer demand, which only the consumers can decide. So when the government consumes, it is taking our money, and spending it on things not necessarily in demand. Since insignificant things are often produced, there is no growth. The only change, is that the consumer who add value to products, have less spending power because the government has taken it and spent it elsewhere.\nThe entire concept of a multiplier is a joke, yet admittedly it is still has a large following with the abundant left leaning economists that promulgate our universities.\nOur economic woes will continue if we do not forsake the ethos that the government can solve the economy by interfering and printing and/or borrowing money. \nOne last comment. You still have not been able to produce a clear cut example of a positive outcome for the Keynesian method. I hope you do not subscribe to the 2009 stimulus as a success. Its my example of its failure.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9jzfz8", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366595629", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9juxgp", "parent_id": "t1_c9juxdq", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431476868, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9juxgp", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366581830", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9juxdq", "parent_id": "t1_c9jtd1o", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431476869, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9juxdq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366581824", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "nonknower", "id": "t1_c9jtd1o", "parent_id": "t1_c9it8q5", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431477607, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think we both agree on one point for sure. That in order for the economic recovery to be bountiful and long lasting, we need more jobs. As stated in an earlier post, with our labor participation rate at its lowest levels in over 30 years, it is no wonder that the economy is mired in the mud. There are two schools of thought on how to fix the economy. It is evident that you subscribe to one set of ideals and I the other.\nYou believe an active government is the catalyst in propelling the economy. The government should step in and pass legislation to encourage employment. My feelings are that government (for the most part) needs to get out of the way in order for the private sector to create jobs. In order to determine which is the best course of action, we need to examine fundamental economic facts. It basically boils down to whether one believes that two similar jobs with equal pay, one in the public sector and one in the private sector are in fact equal. The cursory answer would be yes, they are the same. \nLet me extrapolate on a hypothetical example.\nGettin_Slizzard works in the IT department  for the Environmental Protection Agency. He earns 75k annually. He is able to buy food, pay his mortgage, run his car, educate his kids and maybe even purchase a new 65 inch big screen TV and go on a vacation to Disney World. Oh, and he also pays federal taxes just like everybody else.\n\nNonknower, who works in the IT Department in a private company, also gets paid a $75k salary. After paying his taxes he can also pay his mortgage, buy food, make his car payment, educate his kids and watch the Super Bowl on his new 65\" TV, and go visit Mickey Mouse with the family.\n\nSeemingly, both Getting_Slizzard and Nonknower have the same funds to spend on the same stuff. Thus, both jobs economically the same, correct?\n\nIf you go along with that assertion you could not be more mistaken. They are not alike economically. They are not in the same ballpark.\n\nNonknower works in the private sector. His efforts at work create a product that his employer sells into a market that, with free will, determines whether that product is good value or not. If Nonknower's employer is a smart entrepreneur, then there is value being created by Nonknower, and that value eventually translates into additional wealth that has been created. The additional wealth is shared by Nonknower's employer and his co-workers and indeed everybody who is along the productivity chain, from the providers of the raw material through to the salesman's commission. Not only is value and wealth created along that production chain, but because of Nonknower's ability to spend, it also occurs in every value chain that Nonknower spends his money on. This includes farmers, energy workers, car manufacturers and everywhere throughout the economy.\n\nNow, that all makes sense and is very logical but this is the key point that you should realize.\n\nNonknower's salary gets paid because the accumulated wealth of the world has increased in value. His salary does not get paid because someone else gets paid nothing, or less than they were getting. The ability to pay Nonknower's salary is 100% dependent on the ability of his employer to create wealth where it was not existing before. By the way, that wealth is usually called profit. Profit is not a bad word, it does not steal from the worker, or take from someone else...it is simply the creation of wealth.\n\nLet's contrast this with Gettin_Slizzard who holds a government job as a technician in a computer center. Gettin_Slizzard works just as hard as Nonknower, and actually does a valuable job, keeping the EPA computers safe from viruses. He doesn't actually create anything, and he is not part of a chain that produces a product that is sold to the private sector, but he does keep the EPA computers running smoothly.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, does not create any products that can be sold to the private sector either, but they do create regulations and employ an awful lot of people to support those regulations. There are many Gettin_Slizzard's, thus keeping unemployment down. After all, without the EPA creating precepts, Gettin_Slizzard would not have a job...but here he is earning his $75k salary, and not collecting unemployment.\n\nAnd of course, he takes his salary and spends it and that keeps entire value chains creating new wealth, so it is all good!\n\nNot quite. Since Gettin_Slizzard has to get paid, the government has no revenues or profits, so where does the money for Gettin_Slizzard's salary come from? It comes from one of three places. Taxation, printing money or borrowing money. There is no other way that Gettin_Slizzard can get paid.\n\nSo let's take a look at these three sources of Gettin_Slizzard's salary:\n \nTaxation\n\nIf Gettin_Slizzard did not have his job at the EPA, we would not have to pay $75k in taxes. If we did not have to pay a further $75k in taxes, it would be available to be spent on the value chain that creates additional wealth.\n\nSo...the fact that Gettin_Slizzard spends his salary on the value chain is not an argument since if Gettin_Slizzard did not have that job, you and I could spend that exact same amount of money on the value chain that creates wealth.\n\nGettin_Slizzard's salary as a government worker is nothing more than a \"circulation of capital\"....the government takes it from us and gives it to Gettin_Slizzard so he can spend it....it is the same money, just circulated in a different way.\n\nIf Gettin_Slizzard's job is paid for through taxation, it has zero effect on the economy. Sorry Gettin_Slizzard, your job makes no difference!!\n\nPrinting Money\n\nLet's make a simple assumption. The government was unable to tax us $75k more to pay for Gettin_Slizzard's job. The government knew that if it did that we would revolt and throw the bums out of office. We were not willing to pay any more tax so that Gettin_Slizzard could have a job.\n\nThe government still thinks they need Gettin_Slizzard to keep the computers at the EPA running, so they give him a job, and, since they are the government, simply print an extra $75k in notes that they can use for his salary. In fact, that is an even better deal for the economy because the Government is no longer simply circulating capital, but is increasing cash going into the economy because of the value that Gettin_Slizzard's job provides in building wealth.\n\nWell, this sounds good except for two things. The first is that Gettin_Slizzard's job does not create any wealth. And the second is that money that is simply printed and put into the economy does not change the world's accumulated wealth...it neither increases it nor decreases it. Because the world's wealth has not increased by the extra $75k the government has put into the economy, we have to ask what happened to it? Well, everyone who holds dollars finds out that their dollars are not worth as much as yesterday. Gettin_Slizzard's salary has come from the inflation of the dollar. This inflation means that everybody has less purchasing power...and cannot spend as much in the value chain of wealth creation.\n\nIn this case Gettin_Slizzard gets paid by reducing how much you can purchase with your money. This is the effect of inflation, which is used to pay Gettin_Slizzard's salary. Gettin_Slizzard has created no new wealth, and Gettin_Slizzard's salary has contributed no more to economic wealth than if he did not have the job at all. This again, is simply circulation of capital and cannot in any way create wealth and grow the economy. Sorry Gettin_Slizzard...your job is not looking real good right now...maybe if the government borrowed?\n\nGovernment Borrowing\n\nSo, the government cannot increase taxation or simply print money to pay for Gettin_Slizzard's salary.\n\nTheir final option is to borrow some money from another country and use that to pay Gettin_Slizzard. So the American bankers hop on a Lear Jet to Beijing and tell the Chinese...lend us $75k to pay Gettin_Slizzard, and next year we will pay you back $80k. The Chinese accept this deal....at the end of the day, with the full faith and credit of the United States Government, a mere $75k loan is very easy to do.\n\nSo, the Bankers come back with $75k in their attache cases and give that to Gettin_Slizzard for his beneficial labor at the EPA.\n\nGettin_Slizzard spends that money in exactly the same way as Nonknower. But the economy doesn't change...why? Because the sheer borrowing of money does not create new wealth. The introduction of the $75k from China has established precisly the same inflation as if the money had simply been printed in the first place.\n\nSo...the problem is that this is no different than the outcome of printing money. Simply a circulation of capital!\n\nBut it becomes more distressing..\n\nAmerica has to pay China back...and since the government has no money of its own, it has three choices. Raise taxes, print money, or borrow money.\n\nCan you see a pattern developing? When we borrow money to pay Gettin_Slizzard, we find ourselves in a never ending cycle of  higher taxes, inflation and growing debt. This unsound economic structure will eventually come crashing down.\n\nI think the above examples show exactly the reason why Keynesian policies have never, and will never succeed in improving the economy in a healthy and sustained manner.\n\n", "edited": 1366586391, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9jtd1o", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366577110", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9it8q5", "parent_id": "t1_c9is8uu", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431495114, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9it8q5", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366419298", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "nonknower", "id": "t1_c9is8uu", "parent_id": "t1_c9i3dvk", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431495583, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Huge growth in spending and deficits, increase the prospect of future tax increases. Many people realize that increased spending must be paid for sooner or later. Concern over future tax rates is one of the main reasons for heightened uncertainty and reduced confidence. Most of the government spending programs redistribute income from workers to the unemployed. This, Keynesians stress, increases the betterment of many hurt by the recession. What their models disregard, however, is the reduced productivity that follows a shift of resources toward redistribution and away from productive investment. Keynesian theory argues that each dollar of government spending has a larger effect on output than a dollar of tax reduction. But in reality the reverse has proven true. Permanent tax reduction generates more expansion than increased government spending of the same dollars. The resulting difference in productivity is a main reason for the difference in results.  Keynesian models ignore the adverse effects of the costly regulations that stream out of the bureaucracy. We also have an overzealous group of financial regulators, guardians of unions, and environmental regulators . Their determinations increase future costs and breed uneasiness. How can corporate executives approximate future return on new investment when tax rates and costs are mystifying? Holding cash and waiting for less uncertainty is the predominant reaction. Hence, the \"economic recovery\" dawdles. Job creation in March was a sad 88,000. The labor particpation rate is the lowest since Jimmy Carter was President http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/04/07/march-labor-force-participation/2057887/.\nCurrent American monetary policies are primarily aimed at getting short term result. A conservative estimate of the cost of new jobs produced from the stimulus bill is at least $170,000 per job http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/nbrnberwo/16759.htm . How can that please taxpayers who will assume those costs? Once the funding ends, the jobs vanish, but the bonds that financed them remain and must be satisfied. These medium and long-term results are discounted in Keynesian paradigms. Noticeably, a more proficient fiscal policy would bring back the long-term growth rate by diminishing uncertainty and restoring corporate and consumer confidence. The singular rationale that Keynesian economics model has persisted is  not because it works, but because it justifies what liberal politicians do.

That private sector growth is what creates employment after the stimulus funds end. \n\nThere is little evidence that supply is the main problem with our economy, most analysis' of stimulus conclude that it was worth it, and I only support running high deficits in times of low demand. My problem with your analysis is that it assumes all the worst without even conceding the most minor of points, like the possibility that the economy needs more consumers for the private sector to hire anyone.

The government should step in and pass legislation to encourage employment. My feelings are that government (for the most part) needs to get out of the way in order for the private sector to create jobs.\n\nThis is a misrepresentation of what I believe. I believe, backed by strong evidence, that there are scenarios where the private sector is risk-adverse to hiring new employees and boosting productivity. I think the government's role in the economy at this point is to get the private sector to hire again. This can happen through either supply or demand. If supply is the problem, then the company is short on cash to hire more people and corporate tax cuts, loans, cash infusions, etc would allow the company to hire more people. \n\nIf demand is the problem, then the problem is that there are not enough consumers. This cannot be fixed independently by the private sector. At this point it is the government's responsibility to directly hire employees who will become consumers of private sector goods, allowing the private sector to flourish.\n\n&gt;Let's contrast this with Gettin_Slizzard who holds a government job as a technician in a computer center. Gettin_Slizzard works just as hard as Nonknower, and actually does a valuable job, keeping the EPA computers safe from viruses. He doesn't actually create anything, and he is not part of a chain that produces a product that is sold to the private sector, but he does keep the EPA computers running smoothly.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, does not create any products that can be sold to the private sector either, but they do create regulations and employ an awful lot of people to support those regulations. There are many Gettin_Slizzard's, thus keeping unemployment down. After all, without the EPA creating precepts, Gettin_Slizzard would not have a job...but here he is earning his $75k salary, and not collecting unemployment.\n\nThis is misleading for a few reasons\n\nFirst, the EPA's purpose is NOT an economic one, but an environmental one. It's goal is NOT to provide employment, but to protect the environment. \n\nSecond, I do not support regulatory action as stimulus. Of course it doesnt boost the economy.\n\nThirdly, the EPA does provide a service that benefits the economy. The EPA is part of a critical economic chain. It provides environmental capital. While overregulation can be a problem, it is wrong to completely dismiss certain economic benefits of SOME regulation. Pollution may degrade air quality and drain the economy because of increased health care spending or declining agricultural productivity. Overfishing provides short-run economic benefits, but dooms ocean ecosystems in the long-run, which even from a purely economic perspective is bad. This ignores direct harm to the public.  \n \nLet's look at a more tangible public service that is less abstract than the EPA and has a more direct impact on the economy. Building of infrastructure is something that the private sector rarely does, because of its high initial capital costs. But free and accessible public transportation and electricity systems provided by the government reduce the costs of operating a business. They also provide for the public good.\n\nIn the case of infrastructure, even assuming it was completely funded by taxes, it is best for the economy in the long-term, because it decreases the cost of living, operating businesses, etc.\n\nThe government has a purpose other than promoting the economy. Promoting the well-being of its citizens by protecting the health and security of them. These must be weighed against potential economic effects. \n\n&gt;So...the fact that Gettin_Slizzard spends his salary on the value chain is not an argument since if Gettin_Slizzard did not have that job, you and I could spend that exact same amount of money on the value chain that creates wealth.\n\nWell actually, this is a concept known as the multiplier effect and it applies to both private and public sector spending.\n\n\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "selftext": "&gt;Gettin_Slizzard's salary as a government worker is nothing more than a \"circulation of capital\"....the government takes it from us and gives it to Gettin_Slizzard so he can spend it....it is the same money, just circulated in a different way.\nIf Gettin_Slizzard's job is paid for through taxation, it has zero effect on the economy. Sorry Gettin_Slizzard, your job makes no difference!!\n\nWhile it is true in the case of taxation that the money must first be taken out of the economy and therefore the stimulative effect will be reduced, it's important to note the goals of stimulus.\n\nBorrowing does not suffer from the same problems, but more of that later. \n\nIt is to create new consumers so the private sector will hire more employees to service these consumers.\n\n&gt; money that is simply printed and put into the economy does not change the world's accumulated wealth...it neither increases it nor decreases it.

Well, everyone who holds dollars finds out that their dollars are not worth as much as yesterday. Gettin_Slizzard's salary has come from the inflation of the dollar. This inflation means that everybody has less purchasing power...and cannot spend as much in the value chain of wealth creation\n\nThis isn't exactly true. Inflation is the rise in price for goods and services, for one thing if the gov printed $75k to pay for my job, it would be imperceptible by markets as a share of the total money supply. If the money supply is $1.18 tr, businesses simply cannot charge .000063% more for goods and services. It is ludicrous.\n\nAlso, [this](http://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2011/05/14/money-growth-does-not-cause-inflation/) article is great at explaining the cause of inflation. \n\n&gt; Their final option is to borrow some money from another country and use that to pay Gettin_Slizzard. So the American bankers jump on a plane and fly to China and tell the Chinese...lend us $75k to pay Gettin_Slizzard, and next year we will you back $80k, ok? The Chinese like this deal....after all, with the full faith and credit of the United States Government, a mere $75k loan is very easy to do.\nSo, the Bankers come back with $75k in fresh US $100 bills stuffing their pockets and give that to Gettin_Slizzard for his valuable work at the EPA.\nGettin_Slizzard spends that money in exactly the same way as Nonknower. But the economy doesn't change...why? Because the mere borrowing of money does not create new wealth. The inflow of the $75k from China has created exactly the same inflation as if the money had simply been printed in the first place.\nSo...the problem is that this is no different than the impact of printing money. Simply a circulation of capital!\nBut it becomes more distressing..\nAmerica has to pay China back...and since the government has no money of its own, it has three choices. Raise taxes, print money, or borrow money.\nCan you see a pattern developing? When we borrow money to pay Gettin_Slizzard, we find ourselves in a never ending cycle of higher taxes, inflation and growing debt. This unsound economic structure will eventually come crashing down.\n\nFirst, the vast majority of borrowed money comes from US citizens, which means they weren't investing that money in the first place. Though, there is a possibility of a crowd-out effect, it rarely overwhelms the stimulative effect of borrowed stimulus.\n\nSecond, it is not inflation, because it is a method of creating wealth without printing any money. It is an exchange of spending now for spending later. \n\nThirdly, this assumes positive interest rates. While this is normally the case, we have [recently](http://www.epi.org/blog/infrastructure-benefits/) seen a very interesting scenario where interest rates were negative, meaning that markets were willing to pay the government to spend money.\n\nFourthly, stimulus-funded employees ARE NOT PERMANENT. Using this example, let's say a stimulus project funds a construction company using borrowed money to be paid back in 5 years. The worker is directed to make improvements to a highly congested highway. The construction company is desperate for work and begins construction. It pays its employees and they spend that money in the economy, that money then gets spent and spent and spent. A local restaurant see that all these construction workers have money to spend, so they hire new employees to service the workers. These new employees then cause other businesses in the area to hire more and etc. The construction company purchased its supplies from a local steel mill, which hires new employees and productive capacity to supply the construction company. These employees contribute to the cyclical growth. When the government creates new consumers, it helps business.\n\nConstruction is finished in a year and the government ends the contract. The restaurant we saw earlier is booming, because of the new consumers and hires the construction company from earlier to increase the capacity of the restaurant. This is when economic growth becomes entirely independent of the government.\n\nThe new jobs means more people are paying taxes and the initial borrowed money to pay for the construction contract is paid off with interest, meaning all parties gained money and profited. This also means no one is trapped in a debt cycle.\n\nMeanwhile the newly improved road does not require future repair work and means the government has to spend less money on repairing the bridge. The less congested road allows for easier access to the restaurant and new customers allows it to flourish. The steel mill now has to pay less gas to bypass the congested highway and can afford to increased its productive capacity. Less congestion means the citizens are wasting less time in traffic and more time working in the economy. A particular pothole on the highway was repaired, meaning the local people no longer have to waste their precious paychecks fixing their vehicles that were damaged by the shotty roadwork that was present before. The new road makes the town more attractive and boosts local property values increasing the retail sector. The less congested road also contributes less to air pollution, saving health care costs, helping the local farmer, and making the people happier, further boosting property values.\n\nThe temporary spending by the government funded a prosperous and permanent growth in the economy. The debts were paid off and the people are happy, healthy, and well off.\n\n\nNow, let me ask you a single question.

I merely picked them as an example of a government agency. I could have used Department of Energy or Transportation. However, that being said, the over-regulation by these government agencies clearly has an adverse effect of the economy. Please note I did not say no regulation.\n\nQuite often, a supposition will look good as an essay, but fundamentally fizzles in the real world. However, Keynesian economics is not one of those suppositions. It falls short both in theory and in real life.I was hoping to avoid the following little synopsis as it can get confusing and a little boring as well. But you have proven yourself a quite worthy opponent and I am running out of responses. Here it is:\n\nKeynes states that the Gross Domestic Product is equal to Consumption plus Investment plus Government Spending plus Net Exports (GDP=C+I+G+NX). So he assumes that if you increase any variable in the equation, the GDP will grow correspondingly. This is what his entire conclusions are centered on.  However, he routinely disregards the fact that plainly transferring wealth is not creating wealth, but rather just apportions it in another way. I will cite some illustrations of this sophistry.\nFirst, envision this: So in order to increase Government Spending (G), you have to increase taxes. Increasing taxes adds value to the variable  Taxes (T). Increasing Taxes means that Consumption (C) will decrease. That is inescapable\nSo the increase in G is offset by the decrease in C due to higher taxes. The GDP doesn\u2019t expand, it is just proportioned differently. A decrease in T (Taxes) has more of an effect on the economy than increasing G (Government spending) Why? Because consumers will only consume what they demand. We decide what has value. If we decide that iPhone 5\u2019s are more important to us than a parking ramp, iPhone 5\u2019s have more value. That\u2019s because only the consumers can choose what has value by demanding it.\nSo when G is increased, production may increase, but not necessarily production of something we demand. For example, if government spending is increased to pay for a parking ramp in the middle of a potato farm, is that good? No, because something was produced which has no value because it\u2019s not in demand. So government spending takes from consumers (the only people that can give value to something), and spends it on things which may not have value.\nEnvision this: According to this logic, shouldn\u2019t the government hire people to run around and damage things? If that was done, the government could spend the money to repair these things. It\u2019s an increase in G and also gives jobs to people. So shouldn\u2019t Keynes want that?\nOf course, the problem is that nothing was created with value. So it did not expand our wealth.\nAll sorts of issues arise when employment becomes an objective rather than a result. Keynesian economics is in large part a theory dedicated to fight unemployment. Since this is the case, all Keynesians are opposed to all technological advancements that make us more productive and successful, right? Of course, not, that would be absurd. But it would be entirely consistent for Keynesians to maintain that viewpoint.\nAnother thing to understand, is that an increase in C (Consumption) is not intrinsically good. This is especially true when NX (Net Exports) decreases when C is increased.\nFor example, if our nation imports 90% of its goods and services, our Net Exports (NX) will be negative, subtracting from our GDP. So what happens if our C increases by 50%? The -NX will increase enormously. So when we have a deficit in NX, when our C increases, the increase in C is offset by the decrease in NX.\nYou mentioned Keynes concept known as the \u201cMultiplier\u201d. The concept states that government spending is a more powerful tool of economic growth than letting the market consume. Assume that every consumer spends $0.75 out of every $1.00 they make. Keynes says that if the government spends $1,000,000 to \u201cstimulate\u201d the economy, you multiply it by a specific number. Let\u2019s say the multiplier is 4. So you multiply the government spending by whatever your multipler is. So in this case, it would be 4 x $1,000,000=$4,000,000. And POOF! That money taken from taxpayers just quadrupled.\nOf course, if you actually think this through, it\u2019s a ridiculous concept. As I mentioned before, the only way value can be added to a product, is through consumer demand, which only the consumers can decide. So when the government consumes, it is taking our money, and spending it on things not necessarily in demand. Since insignificant things are often produced, there is no growth. The only change, is that the consumer who add value to products, have less spending power because the government has taken it and spent it elsewhere.\nThe entire concept of a multiplier is a joke, yet admittedly it is still has a large following with the abundant left leaning economists that promulgate our universities.\nOur economic woes will continue if we do not forsake the ethos that the government can solve the economy by interfering and printing and/or borrowing money. \nOne last comment. You still have not been able to produce a clear cut example of a positive outcome for the Keynesian method. I hope you do not subscribe to the 2009 stimulus as a success. Its my example of its failure.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9jzfz8", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366595629", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9juxgp", "parent_id": "t1_c9juxdq", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431476868, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9juxgp", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366581830", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9juxdq", "parent_id": "t1_c9jtd1o", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431476869, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9juxdq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366581824", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "nonknower", "id": "t1_c9jtd1o", "parent_id": "t1_c9it8q5", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431477607, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think we both agree on one point for sure. That in order for the economic recovery to be bountiful and long lasting, we need more jobs. As stated in an earlier post, with our labor participation rate at its lowest levels in over 30 years, it is no wonder that the economy is mired in the mud. There are two schools of thought on how to fix the economy. It is evident that you subscribe to one set of ideals and I the other.\nYou believe an active government is the catalyst in propelling the economy. The government should step in and pass legislation to encourage employment. My feelings are that government (for the most part) needs to get out of the way in order for the private sector to create jobs. In order to determine which is the best course of action, we need to examine fundamental economic facts. It basically boils down to whether one believes that two similar jobs with equal pay, one in the public sector and one in the private sector are in fact equal. The cursory answer would be yes, they are the same. \nLet me extrapolate on a hypothetical example.\nGettin_Slizzard works in the IT department  for the Environmental Protection Agency. He earns 75k annually. He is able to buy food, pay his mortgage, run his car, educate his kids and maybe even purchase a new 65 inch big screen TV and go on a vacation to Disney World. Oh, and he also pays federal taxes just like everybody else.\n\nNonknower, who works in the IT Department in a private company, also gets paid a $75k salary. After paying his taxes he can also pay his mortgage, buy food, make his car payment, educate his kids and watch the Super Bowl on his new 65\" TV, and go visit Mickey Mouse with the family.\n\nSeemingly, both Getting_Slizzard and Nonknower have the same funds to spend on the same stuff. Thus, both jobs economically the same, correct?\n\nIf you go along with that assertion you could not be more mistaken. They are not alike economically. They are not in the same ballpark.\n\nNonknower works in the private sector. His efforts at work create a product that his employer sells into a market that, with free will, determines whether that product is good value or not. If Nonknower's employer is a smart entrepreneur, then there is value being created by Nonknower, and that value eventually translates into additional wealth that has been created. The additional wealth is shared by Nonknower's employer and his co-workers and indeed everybody who is along the productivity chain, from the providers of the raw material through to the salesman's commission. Not only is value and wealth created along that production chain, but because of Nonknower's ability to spend, it also occurs in every value chain that Nonknower spends his money on. This includes farmers, energy workers, car manufacturers and everywhere throughout the economy.\n\nNow, that all makes sense and is very logical but this is the key point that you should realize.\n\nNonknower's salary gets paid because the accumulated wealth of the world has increased in value. His salary does not get paid because someone else gets paid nothing, or less than they were getting. The ability to pay Nonknower's salary is 100% dependent on the ability of his employer to create wealth where it was not existing before. By the way, that wealth is usually called profit. Profit is not a bad word, it does not steal from the worker, or take from someone else...it is simply the creation of wealth.\n\nLet's contrast this with Gettin_Slizzard who holds a government job as a technician in a computer center. Gettin_Slizzard works just as hard as Nonknower, and actually does a valuable job, keeping the EPA computers safe from viruses. He doesn't actually create anything, and he is not part of a chain that produces a product that is sold to the private sector, but he does keep the EPA computers running smoothly.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, does not create any products that can be sold to the private sector either, but they do create regulations and employ an awful lot of people to support those regulations. There are many Gettin_Slizzard's, thus keeping unemployment down. After all, without the EPA creating precepts, Gettin_Slizzard would not have a job...but here he is earning his $75k salary, and not collecting unemployment.\n\nAnd of course, he takes his salary and spends it and that keeps entire value chains creating new wealth, so it is all good!\n\nNot quite. Since Gettin_Slizzard has to get paid, the government has no revenues or profits, so where does the money for Gettin_Slizzard's salary come from? It comes from one of three places. Taxation, printing money or borrowing money. There is no other way that Gettin_Slizzard can get paid.\n\nSo let's take a look at these three sources of Gettin_Slizzard's salary:\n \nTaxation\n\nIf Gettin_Slizzard did not have his job at the EPA, we would not have to pay $75k in taxes. If we did not have to pay a further $75k in taxes, it would be available to be spent on the value chain that creates additional wealth.\n\nSo...the fact that Gettin_Slizzard spends his salary on the value chain is not an argument since if Gettin_Slizzard did not have that job, you and I could spend that exact same amount of money on the value chain that creates wealth.\n\nGettin_Slizzard's salary as a government worker is nothing more than a \"circulation of capital\"....the government takes it from us and gives it to Gettin_Slizzard so he can spend it....it is the same money, just circulated in a different way.\n\nIf Gettin_Slizzard's job is paid for through taxation, it has zero effect on the economy. Sorry Gettin_Slizzard, your job makes no difference!!\n\nPrinting Money\n\nLet's make a simple assumption. The government was unable to tax us $75k more to pay for Gettin_Slizzard's job. The government knew that if it did that we would revolt and throw the bums out of office. We were not willing to pay any more tax so that Gettin_Slizzard could have a job.\n\nThe government still thinks they need Gettin_Slizzard to keep the computers at the EPA running, so they give him a job, and, since they are the government, simply print an extra $75k in notes that they can use for his salary. In fact, that is an even better deal for the economy because the Government is no longer simply circulating capital, but is increasing cash going into the economy because of the value that Gettin_Slizzard's job provides in building wealth.\n\nWell, this sounds good except for two things. The first is that Gettin_Slizzard's job does not create any wealth. And the second is that money that is simply printed and put into the economy does not change the world's accumulated wealth...it neither increases it nor decreases it. Because the world's wealth has not increased by the extra $75k the government has put into the economy, we have to ask what happened to it? Well, everyone who holds dollars finds out that their dollars are not worth as much as yesterday. Gettin_Slizzard's salary has come from the inflation of the dollar. This inflation means that everybody has less purchasing power...and cannot spend as much in the value chain of wealth creation.\n\nIn this case Gettin_Slizzard gets paid by reducing how much you can purchase with your money. This is the effect of inflation, which is used to pay Gettin_Slizzard's salary. Gettin_Slizzard has created no new wealth, and Gettin_Slizzard's salary has contributed no more to economic wealth than if he did not have the job at all. This again, is simply circulation of capital and cannot in any way create wealth and grow the economy. Sorry Gettin_Slizzard...your job is not looking real good right now...maybe if the government borrowed?\n\nGovernment Borrowing\n\nSo, the government cannot increase taxation or simply print money to pay for Gettin_Slizzard's salary.\n\nTheir final option is to borrow some money from another country and use that to pay Gettin_Slizzard. So the American bankers hop on a Lear Jet to Beijing and tell the Chinese...lend us $75k to pay Gettin_Slizzard, and next year we will pay you back $80k. The Chinese accept this deal....at the end of the day, with the full faith and credit of the United States Government, a mere $75k loan is very easy to do.\n\nSo, the Bankers come back with $75k in their attache cases and give that to Gettin_Slizzard for his beneficial labor at the EPA.\n\nGettin_Slizzard spends that money in exactly the same way as Nonknower. But the economy doesn't change...why? Because the sheer borrowing of money does not create new wealth. The introduction of the $75k from China has established precisly the same inflation as if the money had simply been printed in the first place.\n\nSo...the problem is that this is no different than the outcome of printing money. Simply a circulation of capital!\n\nBut it becomes more distressing..\n\nAmerica has to pay China back...and since the government has no money of its own, it has three choices. Raise taxes, print money, or borrow money.\n\nCan you see a pattern developing? When we borrow money to pay Gettin_Slizzard, we find ourselves in a never ending cycle of  higher taxes, inflation and growing debt. This unsound economic structure will eventually come crashing down.\n\nI think the above examples show exactly the reason why Keynesian policies have never, and will never succeed in improving the economy in a healthy and sustained manner.\n\n", "edited": 1366586391, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9jtd1o", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366577110", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9it8q5", "parent_id": "t1_c9is8uu", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431495114, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9it8q5", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366419298", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "nonknower", "id": "t1_c9is8uu", "parent_id": "t1_c9i3dvk", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431495583, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Huge growth in spending and deficits, increase the prospect of future tax increases. Many people realize that increased spending must be paid for sooner or later. Concern over future tax rates is one of the main reasons for heightened uncertainty and reduced confidence. Most of the government spending programs redistribute income from workers to the unemployed. This, Keynesians stress, increases the betterment of many hurt by the recession. What their models disregard, however, is the reduced productivity that follows a shift of resources toward redistribution and away from productive investment. Keynesian theory argues that each dollar of government spending has a larger effect on output than a dollar of tax reduction. But in reality the reverse has proven true. Permanent tax reduction generates more expansion than increased government spending of the same dollars. The resulting difference in productivity is a main reason for the difference in results.  Keynesian models ignore the adverse effects of the costly regulations that stream out of the bureaucracy. We also have an overzealous group of financial regulators, guardians of unions, and environmental regulators . Their determinations increase future costs and breed uneasiness. How can corporate executives approximate future return on new investment when tax rates and costs are mystifying? Holding cash and waiting for less uncertainty is the predominant reaction. Hence, the \"economic recovery\" dawdles. Job creation in March was a sad 88,000. The labor particpation rate is the lowest since Jimmy Carter was President http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/04/07/march-labor-force-participation/2057887/.\nCurrent American monetary policies are primarily aimed at getting short term result. A conservative estimate of the cost of new jobs produced from the stimulus bill is at least $170,000 per job http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/nbrnberwo/16759.htm . How can that please taxpayers who will assume those costs? Once the funding ends, the jobs vanish, but the bonds that financed them remain and must be satisfied. These medium and long-term results are discounted in Keynesian paradigms. Noticeably, a more proficient fiscal policy would bring back the long-term growth rate by diminishing uncertainty and restoring corporate and consumer confidence.

My problem with your analysis is that it assumes all the worst without even conceding the most minor of points, like the possibility that the economy needs more consumers for the private sector to hire anyone.

The government should step in and pass legislation to encourage employment. My feelings are that government (for the most part) needs to get out of the way in order for the private sector to create jobs.\n\nThis is a misrepresentation of what I believe. I believe, backed by strong evidence, that there are scenarios where the private sector is risk-adverse to hiring new employees and boosting productivity. I think the government's role in the economy at this point is to get the private sector to hire again. This can happen through either supply or demand. If supply is the problem, then the company is short on cash to hire more people and corporate tax cuts, loans, cash infusions, etc would allow the company to hire more people. \n\nIf demand is the problem, then the problem is that there are not enough consumers. This cannot be fixed independently by the private sector. At this point it is the government's responsibility to directly hire employees who will become consumers of private sector goods, allowing the private sector to flourish.\n\n&gt;Let's contrast this with Gettin_Slizzard who holds a government job as a technician in a computer center. Gettin_Slizzard works just as hard as Nonknower, and actually does a valuable job, keeping the EPA computers safe from viruses. He doesn't actually create anything, and he is not part of a chain that produces a product that is sold to the private sector, but he does keep the EPA computers running smoothly.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, does not create any products that can be sold to the private sector either, but they do create regulations and employ an awful lot of people to support those regulations. There are many Gettin_Slizzard's, thus keeping unemployment down. After all, without the EPA creating precepts, Gettin_Slizzard would not have a job...but here he is earning his $75k salary, and not collecting unemployment.\n\nThis is misleading for a few reasons\n\nFirst, the EPA's purpose is NOT an economic one, but an environmental one. It's goal is NOT to provide employment, but to protect the environment. \n\nSecond, I do not support regulatory action as stimulus. Of course it doesnt boost the economy.\n\nThirdly, the EPA does provide a service that benefits the economy. The EPA is part of a critical economic chain. It provides environmental capital. While overregulation can be a problem, it is wrong to completely dismiss certain economic benefits of SOME regulation. Pollution may degrade air quality and drain the economy because of increased health care spending or declining agricultural productivity. Overfishing provides short-run economic benefits, but dooms ocean ecosystems in the long-run, which even from a purely economic perspective is bad. This ignores direct harm to the public.  \n \nLet's look at a more tangible public service that is less abstract than the EPA and has a more direct impact on the economy. Building of infrastructure is something that the private sector rarely does, because of its high initial capital costs. But free and accessible public transportation and electricity systems provided by the government reduce the costs of operating a business. They also provide for the public good.\n\nIn the case of infrastructure, even assuming it was completely funded by taxes, it is best for the economy in the long-term, because it decreases the cost of living, operating businesses, etc.\n\nThe government has a purpose other than promoting the economy. Promoting the well-being of its citizens by protecting the health and security of them. These must be weighed against potential economic effects. \n\n&gt;So...the fact that Gettin_Slizzard spends his salary on the value chain is not an argument since if Gettin_Slizzard did not have that job, you and I could spend that exact same amount of money on the value chain that creates wealth.\n\nWell actually, this is a concept known as the multiplier effect and it applies to both private and public sector spending.\n\n\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "selftext": "&gt;Gettin_Slizzard's salary as a government worker is nothing more than a \"circulation of capital\"....the government takes it from us and gives it to Gettin_Slizzard so he can spend it....it is the same money, just circulated in a different way.\nIf Gettin_Slizzard's job is paid for through taxation, it has zero effect on the economy. Sorry Gettin_Slizzard, your job makes no difference!!\n\nWhile it is true in the case of taxation that the money must first be taken out of the economy and therefore the stimulative effect will be reduced, it's important to note the goals of stimulus.\n\nBorrowing does not suffer from the same problems, but more of that later. \n\nIt is to create new consumers so the private sector will hire more employees to service these consumers.\n\n&gt; money that is simply printed and put into the economy does not change the world's accumulated wealth...it neither increases it nor decreases it. Because the world's wealth has not increased by the extra $75k the government has put into the economy, we have to ask what happened to it? Well, everyone who holds dollars finds out that their dollars are not worth as much as yesterday. Gettin_Slizzard's salary has come from the inflation of the dollar. This inflation means that everybody has less purchasing power...and cannot spend as much in the value chain of wealth creation\n\nThis isn't exactly true. Inflation is the rise in price for goods and services, for one thing if the gov printed $75k to pay for my job, it would be imperceptible by markets as a share of the total money supply. If the money supply is $1.18 tr, businesses simply cannot charge .000063% more for goods and services. It is ludicrous.\n\nAlso, [this](http://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2011/05/14/money-growth-does-not-cause-inflation/) article is great at explaining the cause of inflation. \n\n&gt; Their final option is to borrow some money from another country and use that to pay Gettin_Slizzard. So the American bankers jump on a plane and fly to China and tell the Chinese...lend us $75k to pay Gettin_Slizzard, and next year we will you back $80k, ok? The Chinese like this deal....after all, with the full faith and credit of the United States Government, a mere $75k loan is very easy to do.\nSo, the Bankers come back with $75k in fresh US $100 bills stuffing their pockets and give that to Gettin_Slizzard for his valuable work at the EPA.\nGettin_Slizzard spends that money in exactly the same way as Nonknower. But the economy doesn't change...why? Because the mere borrowing of money does not create new wealth. The inflow of the $75k from China has created exactly the same inflation as if the money had simply been printed in the first place.\nSo...the problem is that this is no different than the impact of printing money. Simply a circulation of capital!\nBut it becomes more distressing..\nAmerica has to pay China back...and since the government has no money of its own, it has three choices. Raise taxes, print money, or borrow money.\nCan you see a pattern developing? When we borrow money to pay Gettin_Slizzard, we find ourselves in a never ending cycle of higher taxes, inflation and growing debt. This unsound economic structure will eventually come crashing down.\n\nFirst, the vast majority of borrowed money comes from US citizens, which means they weren't investing that money in the first place. Though, there is a possibility of a crowd-out effect, it rarely overwhelms the stimulative effect of borrowed stimulus.\n\nSecond, it is not inflation, because it is a method of creating wealth without printing any money. It is an exchange of spending now for spending later. \n\nThirdly, this assumes positive interest rates. While this is normally the case, we have [recently](http://www.epi.org/blog/infrastructure-benefits/) seen a very interesting scenario where interest rates were negative, meaning that markets were willing to pay the government to spend money.\n\nFourthly, stimulus-funded employees ARE NOT PERMANENT. Using this example, let's say a stimulus project funds a construction company using borrowed money to be paid back in 5 years. The worker is directed to make improvements to a highly congested highway. The construction company is desperate for work and begins construction. It pays its employees and they spend that money in the economy, that money then gets spent and spent and spent. A local restaurant see that all these construction workers have money to spend, so they hire new employees to service the workers. These new employees then cause other businesses in the area to hire more and etc. The construction company purchased its supplies from a local steel mill, which hires new employees and productive capacity to supply the construction company. These employees contribute to the cyclical growth. When the government creates new consumers, it helps business.\n\nConstruction is finished in a year and the government ends the contract. The restaurant we saw earlier is booming, because of the new consumers and hires the construction company from earlier to increase the capacity of the restaurant. This is when economic growth becomes entirely independent of the government.\n\nThe new jobs means more people are paying taxes and the initial borrowed money to pay for the construction contract is paid off with interest, meaning all parties gained money and profited. This also means no one is trapped in a debt cycle.\n\nMeanwhile the newly improved road does not require future repair work and means the government has to spend less money on repairing the bridge. The less congested road allows for easier access to the restaurant and new customers allows it to flourish. The steel mill now has to pay less gas to bypass the congested highway and can afford to increased its productive capacity. Less congestion means the citizens are wasting less time in traffic and more time working in the economy. A particular pothole on the highway was repaired, meaning the local people no longer have to waste their precious paychecks fixing their vehicles that were damaged by the shotty roadwork that was present before. The new road makes the town more attractive and boosts local property values increasing the retail sector. The less congested road also contributes less to air pollution, saving health care costs, helping the local farmer, and making the people happier, further boosting property values.\n\nThe temporary spending by the government funded a prosperous and permanent growth in the economy. The debts were paid off and the people are happy, healthy, and well off.\n\n\nNow, let me ask you a single question.

I merely picked them as an example of a government agency. I could have used Department of Energy or Transportation. However, that being said, the over-regulation by these government agencies clearly has an adverse effect of the economy. Please note I did not say no regulation.\n\nQuite often, a supposition will look good as an essay, but fundamentally fizzles in the real world. However, Keynesian economics is not one of those suppositions. It falls short both in theory and in real life.I was hoping to avoid the following little synopsis as it can get confusing and a little boring as well. But you have proven yourself a quite worthy opponent and I am running out of responses. Here it is:\n\nKeynes states that the Gross Domestic Product is equal to Consumption plus Investment plus Government Spending plus Net Exports (GDP=C+I+G+NX). So he assumes that if you increase any variable in the equation, the GDP will grow correspondingly. This is what his entire conclusions are centered on.  However, he routinely disregards the fact that plainly transferring wealth is not creating wealth, but rather just apportions it in another way. I will cite some illustrations of this sophistry.\nFirst, envision this: So in order to increase Government Spending (G), you have to increase taxes. Increasing taxes adds value to the variable  Taxes (T). Increasing Taxes means that Consumption (C) will decrease. That is inescapable\nSo the increase in G is offset by the decrease in C due to higher taxes. The GDP doesn\u2019t expand, it is just proportioned differently. A decrease in T (Taxes) has more of an effect on the economy than increasing G (Government spending) Why? Because consumers will only consume what they demand. We decide what has value. If we decide that iPhone 5\u2019s are more important to us than a parking ramp, iPhone 5\u2019s have more value. That\u2019s because only the consumers can choose what has value by demanding it.\nSo when G is increased, production may increase, but not necessarily production of something we demand. For example, if government spending is increased to pay for a parking ramp in the middle of a potato farm, is that good? No, because something was produced which has no value because it\u2019s not in demand. So government spending takes from consumers (the only people that can give value to something), and spends it on things which may not have value.\nEnvision this: According to this logic, shouldn\u2019t the government hire people to run around and damage things? If that was done, the government could spend the money to repair these things. It\u2019s an increase in G and also gives jobs to people. So shouldn\u2019t Keynes want that?\nOf course, the problem is that nothing was created with value. So it did not expand our wealth.\nAll sorts of issues arise when employment becomes an objective rather than a result. Keynesian economics is in large part a theory dedicated to fight unemployment. Since this is the case, all Keynesians are opposed to all technological advancements that make us more productive and successful, right? Of course, not, that would be absurd. But it would be entirely consistent for Keynesians to maintain that viewpoint.\nAnother thing to understand, is that an increase in C (Consumption) is not intrinsically good. This is especially true when NX (Net Exports) decreases when C is increased.\nFor example, if our nation imports 90% of its goods and services, our Net Exports (NX) will be negative, subtracting from our GDP. So what happens if our C increases by 50%? The -NX will increase enormously. So when we have a deficit in NX, when our C increases, the increase in C is offset by the decrease in NX.\nYou mentioned Keynes concept known as the \u201cMultiplier\u201d. The concept states that government spending is a more powerful tool of economic growth than letting the market consume. Assume that every consumer spends $0.75 out of every $1.00 they make. Keynes says that if the government spends $1,000,000 to \u201cstimulate\u201d the economy, you multiply it by a specific number. Let\u2019s say the multiplier is 4. So you multiply the government spending by whatever your multipler is. So in this case, it would be 4 x $1,000,000=$4,000,000. And POOF! That money taken from taxpayers just quadrupled.\nOf course, if you actually think this through, it\u2019s a ridiculous concept. As I mentioned before, the only way value can be added to a product, is through consumer demand, which only the consumers can decide. So when the government consumes, it is taking our money, and spending it on things not necessarily in demand. Since insignificant things are often produced, there is no growth. The only change, is that the consumer who add value to products, have less spending power because the government has taken it and spent it elsewhere.\nThe entire concept of a multiplier is a joke, yet admittedly it is still has a large following with the abundant left leaning economists that promulgate our universities.\nOur economic woes will continue if we do not forsake the ethos that the government can solve the economy by interfering and printing and/or borrowing money. \nOne last comment. You still have not been able to produce a clear cut example of a positive outcome for the Keynesian method. I hope you do not subscribe to the 2009 stimulus as a success. Its my example of its failure.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9jzfz8", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366595629", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9juxgp", "parent_id": "t1_c9juxdq", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431476868, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9juxgp", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366581830", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9juxdq", "parent_id": "t1_c9jtd1o", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431476869, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9juxdq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366581824", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "nonknower", "id": "t1_c9jtd1o", "parent_id": "t1_c9it8q5", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431477607, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think we both agree on one point for sure. That in order for the economic recovery to be bountiful and long lasting, we need more jobs. As stated in an earlier post, with our labor participation rate at its lowest levels in over 30 years, it is no wonder that the economy is mired in the mud. There are two schools of thought on how to fix the economy. It is evident that you subscribe to one set of ideals and I the other.\nYou believe an active government is the catalyst in propelling the economy. The government should step in and pass legislation to encourage employment. My feelings are that government (for the most part) needs to get out of the way in order for the private sector to create jobs. In order to determine which is the best course of action, we need to examine fundamental economic facts. It basically boils down to whether one believes that two similar jobs with equal pay, one in the public sector and one in the private sector are in fact equal. The cursory answer would be yes, they are the same. \nLet me extrapolate on a hypothetical example.\nGettin_Slizzard works in the IT department  for the Environmental Protection Agency. He earns 75k annually. He is able to buy food, pay his mortgage, run his car, educate his kids and maybe even purchase a new 65 inch big screen TV and go on a vacation to Disney World. Oh, and he also pays federal taxes just like everybody else.\n\nNonknower, who works in the IT Department in a private company, also gets paid a $75k salary. After paying his taxes he can also pay his mortgage, buy food, make his car payment, educate his kids and watch the Super Bowl on his new 65\" TV, and go visit Mickey Mouse with the family.\n\nSeemingly, both Getting_Slizzard and Nonknower have the same funds to spend on the same stuff. Thus, both jobs economically the same, correct?\n\nIf you go along with that assertion you could not be more mistaken. They are not alike economically. They are not in the same ballpark.\n\nNonknower works in the private sector. His efforts at work create a product that his employer sells into a market that, with free will, determines whether that product is good value or not. If Nonknower's employer is a smart entrepreneur, then there is value being created by Nonknower, and that value eventually translates into additional wealth that has been created. The additional wealth is shared by Nonknower's employer and his co-workers and indeed everybody who is along the productivity chain, from the providers of the raw material through to the salesman's commission. Not only is value and wealth created along that production chain, but because of Nonknower's ability to spend, it also occurs in every value chain that Nonknower spends his money on. This includes farmers, energy workers, car manufacturers and everywhere throughout the economy.\n\nNow, that all makes sense and is very logical but this is the key point that you should realize.\n\nNonknower's salary gets paid because the accumulated wealth of the world has increased in value. His salary does not get paid because someone else gets paid nothing, or less than they were getting. The ability to pay Nonknower's salary is 100% dependent on the ability of his employer to create wealth where it was not existing before. By the way, that wealth is usually called profit. Profit is not a bad word, it does not steal from the worker, or take from someone else...it is simply the creation of wealth.\n\nLet's contrast this with Gettin_Slizzard who holds a government job as a technician in a computer center. Gettin_Slizzard works just as hard as Nonknower, and actually does a valuable job, keeping the EPA computers safe from viruses. He doesn't actually create anything, and he is not part of a chain that produces a product that is sold to the private sector, but he does keep the EPA computers running smoothly.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, does not create any products that can be sold to the private sector either, but they do create regulations and employ an awful lot of people to support those regulations. There are many Gettin_Slizzard's, thus keeping unemployment down. After all, without the EPA creating precepts, Gettin_Slizzard would not have a job...but here he is earning his $75k salary, and not collecting unemployment.\n\nAnd of course, he takes his salary and spends it and that keeps entire value chains creating new wealth, so it is all good!\n\nNot quite. Since Gettin_Slizzard has to get paid, the government has no revenues or profits, so where does the money for Gettin_Slizzard's salary come from? It comes from one of three places. Taxation, printing money or borrowing money. There is no other way that Gettin_Slizzard can get paid.\n\nSo let's take a look at these three sources of Gettin_Slizzard's salary:\n \nTaxation\n\nIf Gettin_Slizzard did not have his job at the EPA, we would not have to pay $75k in taxes. If we did not have to pay a further $75k in taxes, it would be available to be spent on the value chain that creates additional wealth.\n\nSo...the fact that Gettin_Slizzard spends his salary on the value chain is not an argument since if Gettin_Slizzard did not have that job, you and I could spend that exact same amount of money on the value chain that creates wealth.\n\nGettin_Slizzard's salary as a government worker is nothing more than a \"circulation of capital\"....the government takes it from us and gives it to Gettin_Slizzard so he can spend it....it is the same money, just circulated in a different way.\n\nIf Gettin_Slizzard's job is paid for through taxation, it has zero effect on the economy. Sorry Gettin_Slizzard, your job makes no difference!!\n\nPrinting Money\n\nLet's make a simple assumption. The government was unable to tax us $75k more to pay for Gettin_Slizzard's job. The government knew that if it did that we would revolt and throw the bums out of office. We were not willing to pay any more tax so that Gettin_Slizzard could have a job.\n\nThe government still thinks they need Gettin_Slizzard to keep the computers at the EPA running, so they give him a job, and, since they are the government, simply print an extra $75k in notes that they can use for his salary. In fact, that is an even better deal for the economy because the Government is no longer simply circulating capital, but is increasing cash going into the economy because of the value that Gettin_Slizzard's job provides in building wealth.\n\nWell, this sounds good except for two things. The first is that Gettin_Slizzard's job does not create any wealth. And the second is that money that is simply printed and put into the economy does not change the world's accumulated wealth...it neither increases it nor decreases it. Because the world's wealth has not increased by the extra $75k the government has put into the economy, we have to ask what happened to it? Well, everyone who holds dollars finds out that their dollars are not worth as much as yesterday. Gettin_Slizzard's salary has come from the inflation of the dollar. This inflation means that everybody has less purchasing power...and cannot spend as much in the value chain of wealth creation.\n\nIn this case Gettin_Slizzard gets paid by reducing how much you can purchase with your money. This is the effect of inflation, which is used to pay Gettin_Slizzard's salary. Gettin_Slizzard has created no new wealth, and Gettin_Slizzard's salary has contributed no more to economic wealth than if he did not have the job at all. This again, is simply circulation of capital and cannot in any way create wealth and grow the economy. Sorry Gettin_Slizzard...your job is not looking real good right now...maybe if the government borrowed?\n\nGovernment Borrowing\n\nSo, the government cannot increase taxation or simply print money to pay for Gettin_Slizzard's salary.\n\nTheir final option is to borrow some money from another country and use that to pay Gettin_Slizzard. So the American bankers hop on a Lear Jet to Beijing and tell the Chinese...lend us $75k to pay Gettin_Slizzard, and next year we will pay you back $80k. The Chinese accept this deal....at the end of the day, with the full faith and credit of the United States Government, a mere $75k loan is very easy to do.\n\nSo, the Bankers come back with $75k in their attache cases and give that to Gettin_Slizzard for his beneficial labor at the EPA.\n\nGettin_Slizzard spends that money in exactly the same way as Nonknower. But the economy doesn't change...why? Because the sheer borrowing of money does not create new wealth. The introduction of the $75k from China has established precisly the same inflation as if the money had simply been printed in the first place.\n\nSo...the problem is that this is no different than the outcome of printing money. Simply a circulation of capital!\n\nBut it becomes more distressing..\n\nAmerica has to pay China back...and since the government has no money of its own, it has three choices. Raise taxes, print money, or borrow money.\n\nCan you see a pattern developing? When we borrow money to pay Gettin_Slizzard, we find ourselves in a never ending cycle of  higher taxes, inflation and growing debt. This unsound economic structure will eventually come crashing down.\n\nI think the above examples show exactly the reason why Keynesian policies have never, and will never succeed in improving the economy in a healthy and sustained manner.\n\n", "edited": 1366586391, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9jtd1o", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366577110", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9it8q5", "parent_id": "t1_c9is8uu", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431495114, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9it8q5", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366419298", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "nonknower", "id": "t1_c9is8uu", "parent_id": "t1_c9i3dvk", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431495583, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Huge growth in spending and deficits, increase the prospect of future tax increases. Many people realize that increased spending must be paid for sooner or later. Concern over future tax rates is one of the main reasons for heightened uncertainty and reduced confidence. Most of the government spending programs redistribute income from workers to the unemployed. This, Keynesians stress, increases the betterment of many hurt by the recession. What their models disregard, however, is the reduced productivity that follows a shift of resources toward redistribution and away from productive investment. Keynesian theory argues that each dollar of government spending has a larger effect on output than a dollar of tax reduction. But in reality the reverse has proven true. Permanent tax reduction generates more expansion than increased government spending of the same dollars. The resulting difference in productivity is a main reason for the difference in results.  Keynesian models ignore the adverse effects of the costly regulations that stream out of the bureaucracy. We also have an overzealous group of financial regulators, guardians of unions, and environmental regulators . Their determinations increase future costs and breed uneasiness. How can corporate executives approximate future return on new investment when tax rates and costs are mystifying? Holding cash and waiting for less uncertainty is the predominant reaction. Hence, the \"economic recovery\" dawdles. Job creation in March was a sad 88,000. The labor particpation rate is the lowest since Jimmy Carter was President http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/04/07/march-labor-force-participation/2057887/.\nCurrent American monetary policies are primarily aimed at getting short term result. A conservative estimate of the cost of new jobs produced from the stimulus bill is at least $170,000 per job http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/nbrnberwo/16759.htm . How can that please taxpayers who will assume those costs? Once the funding ends, the jobs vanish, but the bonds that financed them remain and must be satisfied. These medium and long-term results are discounted in Keynesian paradigms. Noticeably, a more proficient fiscal policy would bring back the long-term growth rate by diminishing uncertainty and restoring corporate and consumer confidence. The singular rationale that Keynesian economics model has persisted is  not because it works, but because it justifies what liberal politicians do.

Governments borrow money from investors or from other governments and then spend that money. If that money succeeds in boosting the economy, then wealth will be created, because all the borrowed money + interest will be paid back. It's the equivalent to taking out a loan to start a small business, your business blossoms and you pay back the loan, everyone wins. \n\nThe second is in terms of income inequality. Most people don't care about wealth, but income. I don't care that rich people are rich or that poor people are poor. Most people care about the opportunity for success. It could be argued that it is very difficult for people born into poverty to advance to the upper class and even for the middle class to advance to the upper class, even between generations.\n\nThe government can fix this lack of opportunity by improving things that benefit everyone, like education, infrastructure, or healthcare. Lowering the cost of living and making it so anyone can access a career of their choosing is usually the best way to alleviate poverty. \n\nEven a progressive income tax could be considered equal, as long as it's the right rate. Because wealth loses value as you become wealthier, the wealthy get more income from investment than salary, and because there are minimum amounts of cash you need to survive, the wealthy simply need less money. ie. Everyone has to pay $200 a month for food, that applies whether you're rich or poor, means that the poor have less disposable income to improve their economic situation. \n\nBut still, even using an expansionary definition of redistribution, the gov can finance job-creation or job-training programs by borrowing money, the gov can improve basic services, food, water, infrastructure, housing, or healthcare to create wealth, without redistributing it.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "selftext": "Although the possibility of spiraling debt is very real (Eurozone crisis), it looks unlikely anytime soon in the United States for multiple reasons;\n\nFirst, as the economy returns to full output, the government will receive more tax revenue from more people working and will have to spend less on safety net programs, this is known as a \"cyclical deficit\"; one caused by a bad economy and not necessarily poor budget decisions.

The government should step in and pass legislation to encourage employment. My feelings are that government (for the most part) needs to get out of the way in order for the private sector to create jobs.\n\nThis is a misrepresentation of what I believe. I believe, backed by strong evidence, that there are scenarios where the private sector is risk-adverse to hiring new employees and boosting productivity. I think the government's role in the economy at this point is to get the private sector to hire again. This can happen through either supply or demand. If supply is the problem, then the company is short on cash to hire more people and corporate tax cuts, loans, cash infusions, etc would allow the company to hire more people. \n\nIf demand is the problem, then the problem is that there are not enough consumers. This cannot be fixed independently by the private sector. At this point it is the government's responsibility to directly hire employees who will become consumers of private sector goods, allowing the private sector to flourish.\n\n&gt;Let's contrast this with Gettin_Slizzard who holds a government job as a technician in a computer center. Gettin_Slizzard works just as hard as Nonknower, and actually does a valuable job, keeping the EPA computers safe from viruses. He doesn't actually create anything, and he is not part of a chain that produces a product that is sold to the private sector, but he does keep the EPA computers running smoothly.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, does not create any products that can be sold to the private sector either, but they do create regulations and employ an awful lot of people to support those regulations. There are many Gettin_Slizzard's, thus keeping unemployment down. After all, without the EPA creating precepts, Gettin_Slizzard would not have a job...but here he is earning his $75k salary, and not collecting unemployment.\n\nThis is misleading for a few reasons\n\nFirst, the EPA's purpose is NOT an economic one, but an environmental one. It's goal is NOT to provide employment, but to protect the environment. \n\nSecond, I do not support regulatory action as stimulus. Of course it doesnt boost the economy.\n\nThirdly, the EPA does provide a service that benefits the economy. The EPA is part of a critical economic chain. It provides environmental capital. While overregulation can be a problem, it is wrong to completely dismiss certain economic benefits of SOME regulation. Pollution may degrade air quality and drain the economy because of increased health care spending or declining agricultural productivity. Overfishing provides short-run economic benefits, but dooms ocean ecosystems in the long-run, which even from a purely economic perspective is bad. This ignores direct harm to the public.  \n \nLet's look at a more tangible public service that is less abstract than the EPA and has a more direct impact on the economy. Building of infrastructure is something that the private sector rarely does, because of its high initial capital costs. But free and accessible public transportation and electricity systems provided by the government reduce the costs of operating a business. They also provide for the public good.\n\nIn the case of infrastructure, even assuming it was completely funded by taxes, it is best for the economy in the long-term, because it decreases the cost of living, operating businesses, etc.\n\nThe government has a purpose other than promoting the economy. Promoting the well-being of its citizens by protecting the health and security of them. These must be weighed against potential economic effects. \n\n&gt;So...the fact that Gettin_Slizzard spends his salary on the value chain is not an argument since if Gettin_Slizzard did not have that job, you and I could spend that exact same amount of money on the value chain that creates wealth.\n\nWell actually, this is a concept known as the multiplier effect and it applies to both private and public sector spending.\n\n\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "selftext": "&gt;Gettin_Slizzard's salary as a government worker is nothing more than a \"circulation of capital\"....the government takes it from us and gives it to Gettin_Slizzard so he can spend it....it is the same money, just circulated in a different way.\nIf Gettin_Slizzard's job is paid for through taxation, it has zero effect on the economy. Sorry Gettin_Slizzard, your job makes no difference!!\n\nWhile it is true in the case of taxation that the money must first be taken out of the economy and therefore the stimulative effect will be reduced, it's important to note the goals of stimulus.\n\nBorrowing does not suffer from the same problems, but more of that later. \n\nIt is to create new consumers so the private sector will hire more employees to service these consumers.\n\n&gt; money that is simply printed and put into the economy does not change the world's accumulated wealth...it neither increases it nor decreases it. Because the world's wealth has not increased by the extra $75k the government has put into the economy, we have to ask what happened to it? Well, everyone who holds dollars finds out that their dollars are not worth as much as yesterday. Gettin_Slizzard's salary has come from the inflation of the dollar. This inflation means that everybody has less purchasing power...and cannot spend as much in the value chain of wealth creation\n\nThis isn't exactly true. Inflation is the rise in price for goods and services, for one thing if the gov printed $75k to pay for my job, it would be imperceptible by markets as a share of the total money supply. If the money supply is $1.18 tr, businesses simply cannot charge .000063% more for goods and services. It is ludicrous.\n\nAlso, [this](http://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2011/05/14/money-growth-does-not-cause-inflation/) article is great at explaining the cause of inflation. \n\n&gt; Their final option is to borrow some money from another country and use that to pay Gettin_Slizzard. So the American bankers jump on a plane and fly to China and tell the Chinese...lend us $75k to pay Gettin_Slizzard, and next year we will you back $80k, ok? The Chinese like this deal....after all, with the full faith and credit of the United States Government, a mere $75k loan is very easy to do.\nSo, the Bankers come back with $75k in fresh US $100 bills stuffing their pockets and give that to Gettin_Slizzard for his valuable work at the EPA.\nGettin_Slizzard spends that money in exactly the same way as Nonknower. But the economy doesn't change...why? Because the mere borrowing of money does not create new wealth. The inflow of the $75k from China has created exactly the same inflation as if the money had simply been printed in the first place.\nSo...the problem is that this is no different than the impact of printing money. Simply a circulation of capital!\nBut it becomes more distressing..\nAmerica has to pay China back...and since the government has no money of its own, it has three choices. Raise taxes, print money, or borrow money.\nCan you see a pattern developing? When we borrow money to pay Gettin_Slizzard, we find ourselves in a never ending cycle of higher taxes, inflation and growing debt. This unsound economic structure will eventually come crashing down.\n\nFirst, the vast majority of borrowed money comes from US citizens, which means they weren't investing that money in the first place. Though, there is a possibility of a crowd-out effect, it rarely overwhelms the stimulative effect of borrowed stimulus.\n\nSecond, it is not inflation, because it is a method of creating wealth without printing any money. It is an exchange of spending now for spending later. \n\nThirdly, this assumes positive interest rates. While this is normally the case, we have [recently](http://www.epi.org/blog/infrastructure-benefits/) seen a very interesting scenario where interest rates were negative, meaning that markets were willing to pay the government to spend money.\n\nFourthly, stimulus-funded employees ARE NOT PERMANENT. Using this example, let's say a stimulus project funds a construction company using borrowed money to be paid back in 5 years. The worker is directed to make improvements to a highly congested highway. The construction company is desperate for work and begins construction. It pays its employees and they spend that money in the economy, that money then gets spent and spent and spent. A local restaurant see that all these construction workers have money to spend, so they hire new employees to service the workers. These new employees then cause other businesses in the area to hire more and etc. The construction company purchased its supplies from a local steel mill, which hires new employees and productive capacity to supply the construction company. These employees contribute to the cyclical growth. When the government creates new consumers, it helps business.\n\nConstruction is finished in a year and the government ends the contract. The restaurant we saw earlier is booming, because of the new consumers and hires the construction company from earlier to increase the capacity of the restaurant. This is when economic growth becomes entirely independent of the government.\n\nThe new jobs means more people are paying taxes and the initial borrowed money to pay for the construction contract is paid off with interest, meaning all parties gained money and profited. This also means no one is trapped in a debt cycle.\n\nMeanwhile the newly improved road does not require future repair work and means the government has to spend less money on repairing the bridge. The less congested road allows for easier access to the restaurant and new customers allows it to flourish. The steel mill now has to pay less gas to bypass the congested highway and can afford to increased its productive capacity. Less congestion means the citizens are wasting less time in traffic and more time working in the economy. A particular pothole on the highway was repaired, meaning the local people no longer have to waste their precious paychecks fixing their vehicles that were damaged by the shotty roadwork that was present before. The new road makes the town more attractive and boosts local property values increasing the retail sector. The less congested road also contributes less to air pollution, saving health care costs, helping the local farmer, and making the people happier, further boosting property values.\n\nThe temporary spending by the government funded a prosperous and permanent growth in the economy. The debts were paid off and the people are happy, healthy, and well off.\n\n\nNow, let me ask you a single question.

I merely picked them as an example of a government agency. I could have used Department of Energy or Transportation. However, that being said, the over-regulation by these government agencies clearly has an adverse effect of the economy. Please note I did not say no regulation.\n\nQuite often, a supposition will look good as an essay, but fundamentally fizzles in the real world. However, Keynesian economics is not one of those suppositions. It falls short both in theory and in real life.I was hoping to avoid the following little synopsis as it can get confusing and a little boring as well. But you have proven yourself a quite worthy opponent and I am running out of responses. Here it is:\n\nKeynes states that the Gross Domestic Product is equal to Consumption plus Investment plus Government Spending plus Net Exports (GDP=C+I+G+NX). So he assumes that if you increase any variable in the equation, the GDP will grow correspondingly. This is what his entire conclusions are centered on.  However, he routinely disregards the fact that plainly transferring wealth is not creating wealth, but rather just apportions it in another way. I will cite some illustrations of this sophistry.\nFirst, envision this: So in order to increase Government Spending (G), you have to increase taxes. Increasing taxes adds value to the variable  Taxes (T). Increasing Taxes means that Consumption (C) will decrease. That is inescapable\nSo the increase in G is offset by the decrease in C due to higher taxes. The GDP doesn\u2019t expand, it is just proportioned differently. A decrease in T (Taxes) has more of an effect on the economy than increasing G (Government spending) Why? Because consumers will only consume what they demand. We decide what has value. If we decide that iPhone 5\u2019s are more important to us than a parking ramp, iPhone 5\u2019s have more value. That\u2019s because only the consumers can choose what has value by demanding it.\nSo when G is increased, production may increase, but not necessarily production of something we demand. For example, if government spending is increased to pay for a parking ramp in the middle of a potato farm, is that good? No, because something was produced which has no value because it\u2019s not in demand. So government spending takes from consumers (the only people that can give value to something), and spends it on things which may not have value.\nEnvision this: According to this logic, shouldn\u2019t the government hire people to run around and damage things? If that was done, the government could spend the money to repair these things. It\u2019s an increase in G and also gives jobs to people. So shouldn\u2019t Keynes want that?\nOf course, the problem is that nothing was created with value. So it did not expand our wealth.\nAll sorts of issues arise when employment becomes an objective rather than a result. Keynesian economics is in large part a theory dedicated to fight unemployment. Since this is the case, all Keynesians are opposed to all technological advancements that make us more productive and successful, right? Of course, not, that would be absurd. But it would be entirely consistent for Keynesians to maintain that viewpoint.\nAnother thing to understand, is that an increase in C (Consumption) is not intrinsically good. This is especially true when NX (Net Exports) decreases when C is increased.\nFor example, if our nation imports 90% of its goods and services, our Net Exports (NX) will be negative, subtracting from our GDP. So what happens if our C increases by 50%? The -NX will increase enormously. So when we have a deficit in NX, when our C increases, the increase in C is offset by the decrease in NX.\nYou mentioned Keynes concept known as the \u201cMultiplier\u201d. The concept states that government spending is a more powerful tool of economic growth than letting the market consume. Assume that every consumer spends $0.75 out of every $1.00 they make. Keynes says that if the government spends $1,000,000 to \u201cstimulate\u201d the economy, you multiply it by a specific number. Let\u2019s say the multiplier is 4. So you multiply the government spending by whatever your multipler is. So in this case, it would be 4 x $1,000,000=$4,000,000. And POOF! That money taken from taxpayers just quadrupled.\nOf course, if you actually think this through, it\u2019s a ridiculous concept. As I mentioned before, the only way value can be added to a product, is through consumer demand, which only the consumers can decide. So when the government consumes, it is taking our money, and spending it on things not necessarily in demand. Since insignificant things are often produced, there is no growth. The only change, is that the consumer who add value to products, have less spending power because the government has taken it and spent it elsewhere.\nThe entire concept of a multiplier is a joke, yet admittedly it is still has a large following with the abundant left leaning economists that promulgate our universities.\nOur economic woes will continue if we do not forsake the ethos that the government can solve the economy by interfering and printing and/or borrowing money. \nOne last comment. You still have not been able to produce a clear cut example of a positive outcome for the Keynesian method. I hope you do not subscribe to the 2009 stimulus as a success. Its my example of its failure.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9jzfz8", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366595629", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9juxgp", "parent_id": "t1_c9juxdq", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431476868, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9juxgp", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366581830", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9juxdq", "parent_id": "t1_c9jtd1o", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431476869, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9juxdq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366581824", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "nonknower", "id": "t1_c9jtd1o", "parent_id": "t1_c9it8q5", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431477607, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think we both agree on one point for sure.

The cursory answer would be yes, they are the same. \nLet me extrapolate on a hypothetical example.\nGettin_Slizzard works in the IT department  for the Environmental Protection Agency. He earns 75k annually. He is able to buy food, pay his mortgage, run his car, educate his kids and maybe even purchase a new 65 inch big screen TV and go on a vacation to Disney World. Oh, and he also pays federal taxes just like everybody else.\n\nNonknower, who works in the IT Department in a private company, also gets paid a $75k salary. After paying his taxes he can also pay his mortgage, buy food, make his car payment, educate his kids and watch the Super Bowl on his new 65\" TV, and go visit Mickey Mouse with the family.\n\nSeemingly, both Getting_Slizzard and Nonknower have the same funds to spend on the same stuff. Thus, both jobs economically the same, correct?\n\nIf you go along with that assertion you could not be more mistaken. They are not alike economically. They are not in the same ballpark.\n\nNonknower works in the private sector. His efforts at work create a product that his employer sells into a market that, with free will, determines whether that product is good value or not. If Nonknower's employer is a smart entrepreneur, then there is value being created by Nonknower, and that value eventually translates into additional wealth that has been created. The additional wealth is shared by Nonknower's employer and his co-workers and indeed everybody who is along the productivity chain, from the providers of the raw material through to the salesman's commission. Not only is value and wealth created along that production chain, but because of Nonknower's ability to spend, it also occurs in every value chain that Nonknower spends his money on. This includes farmers, energy workers, car manufacturers and everywhere throughout the economy.\n\nNow, that all makes sense and is very logical but this is the key point that you should realize.\n\nNonknower's salary gets paid because the accumulated wealth of the world has increased in value. His salary does not get paid because someone else gets paid nothing, or less than they were getting. The ability to pay Nonknower's salary is 100% dependent on the ability of his employer to create wealth where it was not existing before. By the way, that wealth is usually called profit. Profit is not a bad word, it does not steal from the worker, or take from someone else...it is simply the creation of wealth.\n\nLet's contrast this with Gettin_Slizzard who holds a government job as a technician in a computer center. Gettin_Slizzard works just as hard as Nonknower, and actually does a valuable job, keeping the EPA computers safe from viruses. He doesn't actually create anything, and he is not part of a chain that produces a product that is sold to the private sector, but he does keep the EPA computers running smoothly.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, does not create any products that can be sold to the private sector either, but they do create regulations and employ an awful lot of people to support those regulations. There are many Gettin_Slizzard's, thus keeping unemployment down. After all, without the EPA creating precepts, Gettin_Slizzard would not have a job...but here he is earning his $75k salary, and not collecting unemployment.\n\nAnd of course, he takes his salary and spends it and that keeps entire value chains creating new wealth, so it is all good!\n\nNot quite. Since Gettin_Slizzard has to get paid, the government has no revenues or profits, so where does the money for Gettin_Slizzard's salary come from? It comes from one of three places. Taxation, printing money or borrowing money. There is no other way that Gettin_Slizzard can get paid.\n\nSo let's take a look at these three sources of Gettin_Slizzard's salary:\n \nTaxation\n\nIf Gettin_Slizzard did not have his job at the EPA, we would not have to pay $75k in taxes. If we did not have to pay a further $75k in taxes, it would be available to be spent on the value chain that creates additional wealth.\n\nSo...the fact that Gettin_Slizzard spends his salary on the value chain is not an argument since if Gettin_Slizzard did not have that job, you and I could spend that exact same amount of money on the value chain that creates wealth.\n\nGettin_Slizzard's salary as a government worker is nothing more than a \"circulation of capital\"....the government takes it from us and gives it to Gettin_Slizzard so he can spend it....it is the same money, just circulated in a different way.\n\nIf Gettin_Slizzard's job is paid for through taxation, it has zero effect on the economy. Sorry Gettin_Slizzard, your job makes no difference!!\n\nPrinting Money\n\nLet's make a simple assumption. The government was unable to tax us $75k more to pay for Gettin_Slizzard's job. The government knew that if it did that we would revolt and throw the bums out of office. We were not willing to pay any more tax so that Gettin_Slizzard could have a job.\n\nThe government still thinks they need Gettin_Slizzard to keep the computers at the EPA running, so they give him a job, and, since they are the government, simply print an extra $75k in notes that they can use for his salary. In fact, that is an even better deal for the economy because the Government is no longer simply circulating capital, but is increasing cash going into the economy because of the value that Gettin_Slizzard's job provides in building wealth.\n\nWell, this sounds good except for two things. The first is that Gettin_Slizzard's job does not create any wealth. And the second is that money that is simply printed and put into the economy does not change the world's accumulated wealth...it neither increases it nor decreases it. Because the world's wealth has not increased by the extra $75k the government has put into the economy, we have to ask what happened to it? Well, everyone who holds dollars finds out that their dollars are not worth as much as yesterday. Gettin_Slizzard's salary has come from the inflation of the dollar. This inflation means that everybody has less purchasing power...and cannot spend as much in the value chain of wealth creation.\n\nIn this case Gettin_Slizzard gets paid by reducing how much you can purchase with your money. This is the effect of inflation, which is used to pay Gettin_Slizzard's salary. Gettin_Slizzard has created no new wealth, and Gettin_Slizzard's salary has contributed no more to economic wealth than if he did not have the job at all. This again, is simply circulation of capital and cannot in any way create wealth and grow the economy. Sorry Gettin_Slizzard...your job is not looking real good right now...maybe if the government borrowed?\n\nGovernment Borrowing\n\nSo, the government cannot increase taxation or simply print money to pay for Gettin_Slizzard's salary.\n\nTheir final option is to borrow some money from another country and use that to pay Gettin_Slizzard. So the American bankers hop on a Lear Jet to Beijing and tell the Chinese...lend us $75k to pay Gettin_Slizzard, and next year we will pay you back $80k. The Chinese accept this deal....at the end of the day, with the full faith and credit of the United States Government, a mere $75k loan is very easy to do.\n\nSo, the Bankers come back with $75k in their attache cases and give that to Gettin_Slizzard for his beneficial labor at the EPA.\n\nGettin_Slizzard spends that money in exactly the same way as Nonknower. But the economy doesn't change...why? Because the sheer borrowing of money does not create new wealth. The introduction of the $75k from China has established precisly the same inflation as if the money had simply been printed in the first place.\n\nSo...the problem is that this is no different than the outcome of printing money. Simply a circulation of capital!\n\nBut it becomes more distressing..\n\nAmerica has to pay China back...and since the government has no money of its own, it has three choices. Raise taxes, print money, or borrow money.\n\nCan you see a pattern developing? When we borrow money to pay Gettin_Slizzard, we find ourselves in a never ending cycle of  higher taxes, inflation and growing debt. This unsound economic structure will eventually come crashing down.\n\nI think the above examples show exactly the reason why Keynesian policies have never, and will never succeed in improving the economy in a healthy and sustained manner.\n\n", "edited": 1366586391, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9jtd1o", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366577110", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9it8q5", "parent_id": "t1_c9is8uu", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431495114, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9it8q5", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366419298", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "nonknower", "id": "t1_c9is8uu", "parent_id": "t1_c9i3dvk", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431495583, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Huge growth in spending and deficits, increase the prospect of future tax increases. Many people realize that increased spending must be paid for sooner or later. Concern over future tax rates is one of the main reasons for heightened uncertainty and reduced confidence. Most of the government spending programs redistribute income from workers to the unemployed. This, Keynesians stress, increases the betterment of many hurt by the recession. What their models disregard, however, is the reduced productivity that follows a shift of resources toward redistribution and away from productive investment. Keynesian theory argues that each dollar of government spending has a larger effect on output than a dollar of tax reduction. But in reality the reverse has proven true. Permanent tax reduction generates more expansion than increased government spending of the same dollars. The resulting difference in productivity is a main reason for the difference in results.  Keynesian models ignore the adverse effects of the costly regulations that stream out of the bureaucracy. We also have an overzealous group of financial regulators, guardians of unions, and environmental regulators . Their determinations increase future costs and breed uneasiness. How can corporate executives approximate future return on new investment when tax rates and costs are mystifying? Holding cash and waiting for less uncertainty is the predominant reaction. Hence, the \"economic recovery\" dawdles. Job creation in March was a sad 88,000. The labor particpation rate is the lowest since Jimmy Carter was President http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/04/07/march-labor-force-participation/2057887/.\nCurrent American monetary policies are primarily aimed at getting short term result. A conservative estimate of the cost of new jobs produced from the stimulus bill is at least $170,000 per job http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/nbrnberwo/16759.htm . How can that please taxpayers who will assume those costs? Once the funding ends, the jobs vanish, but the bonds that financed them remain and must be satisfied. These medium and long-term results are discounted in Keynesian paradigms. Noticeably, a more proficient fiscal policy would bring back the long-term growth rate by diminishing uncertainty and restoring corporate and consumer confidence. The singular rationale that Keynesian economics model has persisted is  not because it works, but because it justifies what liberal politicians do. That is, spend irresponsibly, run up the national debt, which will be someone else\u2019s problem later.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9is8uu", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366416066", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9i3dvk", "parent_id": "t1_c9i19j4", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431507513, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9i3dvk", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366329735", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "nonknower", "id": "t1_c9i19j4", "parent_id": "t1_c9hdfpw", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431508584, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I agree that the more the years pass the more debate economist will have on a particular policies effectiveness.So if we go back in time to May 1939,and FDR's Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau's sworn testimony.

In many free industrialized societies, debt has inundated or is about to inundate the economy's debt-servicing ability.

However, borrowed money has progressively been fallaciously invested or dissipated on consumption in recent decades.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I think most people are underestimating both the size of the North Korean artillery forces and the chaos that would take place in the event of a war. It's also important to note that when people use the terms flatten or destroy, they aren't saying the entire city of Seoul is going to literally be destroyed, but more so the number of deaths would be so incredibly devastating. The following is assuming that North Korea also intends to do as much feasible damage to Seoul as possible using artillery, I don't think they would do that, because it would kill any ability to have a favorable cease fire.\n\nFirst, North Korea [has the largest artillery force in the world](http://www.businessinsider.com/map-of-the-day-how-north-korea-could-destroy-seoul-in-two-hours-2010-5?op=1), with an estimated 8000 highly-mobile artillery pieces. The article mentions the destruction of Seoul in two hours, but I'm not sure what the basis of that is, TIME estimates that North Korea could do it in [half an hour](http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,446776,00.html)\n\nSecond, the number of deaths from artillery is empirically extremely high. Estimates deaths from artillery during WWII are [over half of the total deaths,](http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Artillery_deaths_World_war_2) and that's including the Pacific Theatre, where artillery was sparsely used. It's important to note that Seoul is also the most population-dense city amongst the OECD developed nations, this will make artillery even more effective. Additionally, much of the population lives in [hastily constructed apartments](http://www.wfs.org/Jan-Feb%2009/Gov.htm), which would increase the likelihood of collapsing buildings and generating shrapnel.  \n\nThird, North Korean artillery would have a lot of time to fire before allied forces target the artillery pieces. North Korea's military strategy is largely planned around [a massive invasion of South Korea,](http://www.iiss.org/publications/strategic-dossiers/north-korean-dossier/north-koreas-weapons-programmes-a-net-asses/the-conventional-military-balance-on-the-kore/) with the vast majority of their forces concentrated along the border. North Korea also has the largest armed forces, with just under [9.5 million.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_People's_Army) This means that Allied forces would prioritize [immediate damage control](http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/aviation/military/this-is-what-air-war-over-korea-would-look-like-15293363), targeting the flood of North Korean troops and tanks. This in addition to the fact that North Korean artillery is mobile and could be difficult to detect, means that our air forces would focus on taking out the invading forces and their command structure. \n\nThe allied forces would stomp North Korea for sure, but not before North Korea took out a sizable chunk of Seoul's population.

This also means that people should avoid debts.\n\nHowever, a large part of the role of government is protecting its citizens, particularly from economic harm. The act of spending by the government can assist struggling businesses and families in economic downturn.\n\nAnother difference is that there are two types of deficits - cyclical and structural. Structural deficits are deficits that are run because in a budget a government (or household) is purposefully spending more than it takes in, cyclical deficits are the result of a poor economy and put the government into deficit because of less tax income, higher spending on the social safety net, and etc. Cyclical deficits also influence households. In economic downturns, most businesses will cut payrolls and as a result may push a family into cyclical debt, that is NOT because a family is spending too much.\n\nThe main difference hear is that families cannot realistically influence cyclical debts, but governments can (because of the massive scale of the US budget). This is done through controversial stimulus efforts to boost demand for products.\n\nThe economy boils down to supply vs demand; if an economy has a supply shortage, businesses cannot get enough supply to meet demand; if an economy has a demand shortage, no one wants to buy products and as a result businesses dont make them or expand.\n\nIn economic downturns everyone cuts back spending - people stop buying goods, this causes businesses to shed off excess employees and production capability (because it is a waste of money to be maintain employees and production when 2 employees make 5 products, 1 employee can make 2 products, and people are only buying 2 products instead of 5.) \n\nThis causes businesses to lay people off and begin cutting salaries. This furthers the economic decline, because people have less income and demand declines even further and cyclical deficits spiral up.\n\nIt is unreasonable to expect businesses and households to spend more money than they need to to counteract an economic decline, it is also near impossible to convince a critical mass of households to sufficiently boost demand for companies to begin producing again.\n\nWhat stimulus does is the government runs structural deficits to counteract cyclical deficits. It contracts out companies or directly hires public sector employees. With all these new projects and employees comes direct increased employment and therefore incomes. The fact that these jobs are temporary is irrelevant. Other companies then have a financial incentive to begin producing more to accommodate for the temporary rise in demand for goods and services. This causes businesses to rehire people and then incomes actually raise and demand is now on sustainable growth.\n\nThis also means that with more tax income and less safety net spending, government, business, and household cyclical deficits will decline.\n\nKrugman says that right now half of the US deficit is cyclical and that getting the economy back to full employment would therefore cut deficits in half.\n\n", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c94523v", "parent_id": "t3_1b6p67", "score": 5, "retrieved_on": 1431733056, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c94523v", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364494175", "distinguished": null, "ups": 5}
