But luckily the grunt work of policy making in Congress is done by subcommittees, which are supposed to more knowledgeable about their particular niche (there are exceptions like [Todd Akin on the science committee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Akin#Committee_assignments). \n\nAdditionally, Congress isn't the only policy making institutions. Over the last century the trend in political developments in this country has seen an increase in the power of the executive branch. More and more the president can appoint actual experts to positions of real power (my example is Ben Bernanke and the Fed, whether or not you agree with the QE's).\n\nI would also like to point out that there are times when action needed to be taken against majorities. The Civil Rights Act comes to mind.\n\nIn summary, I do support universal suffrage and I don't think we have a perfect government. I think it is good to allow people to have a say in the general way the country is going to be governed, but I don't think it is reasonable to expect that everyone is going to be knowledgeable about all or even most areas of policy or will even be bothered to vote (if we don't have 100% participation rate, then some decisions will be heavily influenced by the self-selection bias). And honestly, I don't think we should allow one Todd Akin or Michelle Bachmann tarnish the general competency in policy making of the government.\n\nI also want to say that a lot of our landmark laws are done with A LOT of negotiations and they get lengthy as a result. Could you imagine putting Obamacare up to popular vote? .1% of the population is actually going to read the bill, and everyone else is going to vote the way he/she feels about it probably after listening to Fox or MSNBC or some other blatantly biased media.

These mercenary gangs consolidated into the force that captured most of Mali with the aid of the nomadic Tuaregs (whom they betrayed immediately after the conquest). Then they successfully forbade music, free speech and women's rights and spent their time in power burning one of the world's biggest libraries of Islamic manuscripts and several ancient sacred shrines (in the maghreb/North Africa, Shrines to important Muslim saints are a significant holy site, radical Islamists believe that this aspect of maghreb practice is idolatry and thus burn these shrines wherever they find them.)\n\nThen France came in an destroyed the occupants and freed Mali to general rejoicing.\n\nTL:DR: not really, radical Islamists took advantage of Arab spring as a soap-box opportunity, but they have not made any significant successes with it, except in Egypt, where Morsi seems to be in bed with the radicals.

Liberalism rejected the notions, common at the time, of hereditary privilege, state religion, absolute monarchy, and the Divine Right of Kings. The early liberal thinker John Locke is often credited with founding liberalism as a distinct philosophical tradition. Locke argued that each man has a natural right to life, liberty and property[8] and according to the social contract, governments must not violate these rights. Liberals opposed traditional conservatism and sought to replace absolutism in government with democracy and/or republicanism and the rule of law.\"\n\nI don't see where you get the limited government part. Liberalism is conventionally associated with attacking or trying to reform the status quo. Conservatives with preserving it (thus the root \"conserve\").\n\nTwo centuries ago this meant supporting a republic for all white men vs. hereditary rule by a chosen bloodline.\n\nOne century ago this meant supporting republic for all white men and women vs. hereditary rule by capitalist magnates.\n\nFifty years ago this meant supporting republic for all men and women except homosexuals and drug users vs hereditary rule by capitalist magnates.\n\nThen after Reagan, a certain strain of Ayn Rand married other conservative strains and produced the brand new notion of conservatives supporting limited government. This built upon conservative support for states rights' but crucially redefined the issue. States rights was inconvenient because conservatives last fought about states rights in order to keep black people from voting. It was also inconvenient because it opened the door to liberal states legalizing gay marriage, weed and (especially then) abortion. \n\nSo the new \"conservative as limited government\" thing was invented, opposed a strawman liberalism in favor of \"big government\".\n\nThis was, from the start, a blatantly hypocritical and nonsensical way to define conservatism because conservatives were the party completely behind the unlimited expansion of the military industrial conmplex (and if that isn't big government, what is?) as well as banning abortion and persecuting homosexuals. \n\nIn this nonsense definition, Liberalism became equated with the social safety net, which became defined as bad (in conservative discourse)\n\nSo basically, the current definition you allude to is the largely inconsequential one.

So your explanation would probably fall under one of my initial suppositions that these stories, despite their importance to leftish goals overall, are just too boring to focus on?\n\nSo I guess if we wanted more focus on these stories about inner city violence resulting from drug prohibition, we'd want to focus on making reporters or editorial staff or whomever is mainly responsible for directing the newscycle, to find them more interesting?", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1csyj7", "selftext": "i'm sure there's psychological studies that understand why people love sensationalist kind of material, but they do.  Sex sells, sensationalism sells.  Its why Star, US weekly, etc. are still alive and well. \n\nyah, the trayvon martin case was sensationalist because it was under a certain set of circumstances.  it wasn't a regular drug-deal gone wrong.  Was it racially motivated? what really happened? what you also had to remember is that it didn't totally explode until it was found out that he wasn't going to be charged and they were just gonna sweep the case under the rug. \n\nand from that perspective, the Martin case became a rallying cry for all of the violence that plagues the streets, esp. with regards to black male youth.  People felt like \"if you let this case die and end up under the rug, ur doing the same to the problem as a whole\"\n\nso is it up to the news media (editorial staff) to push these ends?  they can try, but ultimately the editorial staff ultimately respond to the people, who pay their bills.  the editorial staff ultimately has to \"give the people what they want\" so if the public is apathetic to the situation, they're not going to want to read/watch about it.\n\nultimately it's the people. they have to give a shit. editorial staff can do SOME stuff to make your issue more interesting, but they can't really force people white folk in suburbia or cattle farmers in Montana to give a shit about black on black violence in Trenton, NJ.\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "If the public doesn't care you're SOL, but I'd at least like to see the massive effort invested into a Trayvon Martin case, invested into the death of a toddler nailed by a stray bullet and the underlying causes. If the national media tried and failed that would be one thing, but I have to think that same Montanan who doesn't care much if Chicago is a free fire zone would be marginally pleased if that same Chicago stopped being a free fire zone because there was no drug prohibition to fuel the organized crime. The people who would really care would be people affected; Montana's fairly well out of the loop regardless, but to be fair, a lot of these drive bys happen in the mid-west.\n\nSee the Trayvon case, which I hadn't thought of in relation to this initially, strikes me as exactly what is wrong. From the evidence I've seen, Trayvon was no angelic innocent, Zimmerman was engaged in a job for which he wasn't trained, and Trayvon was the one who pressed the confrontation into an assault and beat the hell out of Zimmerman. I have no clue for sure, and don't claim to. That's my glossed over gleanings from what the media's given us. \n\nSo if something would motivate my ire, it would not be a pointless confrontation that escalated into something deadly. What actually did motivate my ire, and ultimately this post, was what I've mentioned. I read a barely reported almost cursory local news blurb that struck me dead in the heart about a little girl that got shot through a window. In trying to look it up just now I came across so many local stories of little ones getting randomly blasted in drive bys I just had to stop.\n\nHow is the Trayvon Martin story, a story seemingly about a young man who, feeling disrespected for being followed, started a serious assault on a man who happened to have a gun more important than any of the truly innocent, completely harmless children who get killed in drug or gang crime related free for alls? \n\nIf I was going to feel something was a stand in for policy injustice, it certainly wouldn't be an indignant young man getting shot for assaulting someone who the police judged to have been defending himself, albeit in a situation that might not have existed if he had better training.

However, the data for these decisions is selectively provided by a massive intelligence apparatus which answers mostly to itself and has numerous demands and right-violations which never see the desk of a president. \n\nThe CIA informs an American president of what they need and the president accommodates, unless the demands are blatantly in violation of the law (in this case, they are not, the Patriot act is the rule of the land). If you blame Obama for it, you are treating him as an exception, when Obama is merely a traditional American president. If he did try to fight the CIA, he would be branded as a terrorist Muslim out to destroy America's security. Hell, it wouldn't be far from the current conservative discourse. \n\nPoint 2: Drones directly remove danger from American lives. This is not some high handed metaphor: it is pragmatism. A drone delivers a weapon without risking the operator of the weapon. A drone can be operated from a mobile naval platform, meaning that most contemporary enemies would have little or no way of reaching it. Drones mean that soldiers don't have to put themselves in front of bullets.\n\nNow whether or not in the long game, the bad press from drones will motivate more people to kill Americans..well liberal criticize Obama on that point exactly. \n\n ", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;  he would be branded as a terrorist Muslim out to destroy America's security.\n\nhe *has* been in many civilian circles.\n\n&gt;   Drones directly remove danger from American lives.\n\nwait... but that's-\n\n&gt;  Now whether or not in the long game, the bad press from drones will motivate more people to kill Americans..well liberal criticize Obama on that point exactly.\n\nGood save!

On its nose, some small countries have a net worth less than that. But at the same time, HSBC made 16 billion in profits in 2011. \n\nWe definitely have to take the hidden factors of that fine into consideration though. Profits fell from 12 percent from 16.2b to 13.5b in '11 and '12 respectively. Functionally they lost 4.62 billion dollars in profits. That's not even taking into consideration damage to share value. Now, HSBC has pretty much had a new scandal every three months in 2012, so that loss can't be attributed solely to DoJ action. \n\nPicking a number couldn't have been easy. How large or small that number is heavily influence both public perception and HSBC's continued existence. I think the priority for the DoJ was ensuring that this would never happen again. In that respect, I'd imagine HSBC is going above and beyond the call in ensuring it doesn't. At least, they better be.\n\nThe most worrying aspect surrounding this whole affair is the lack of a judicial examination of it. Holder gave them a number, and they took it. Now, there's some really good reason not to have a trial: First it would take ages, probably more than a year and second I'm sure the data mine the DoJ has is absolutely colossal and would require a small army to make it trial ready.\n\nThere's also a really worrying reason not to have a trial: to hide something. That seems unlikely, as the DoJ entertained a lot of press coverage when this was going on. \n\nOf course (as you may observe below in this comment section) an extreme and disturbingly prevalent distrust of the government exists on reddit. I lack a good explanation for it.

At the same time, the [*Regan*](http://www.oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1982/1982_81_2338/) case held that tax-exempt status is a form of public subsidy, and finding that tax-exemption is incompatible with \"substantial lobbying\". \n\nCompare that to Bush II, who established the office of Faith Based Initiatives. [Compare Reagan's 2-1 advantage among evangelical voters with Bush's 3-1, and Romney's 4-1.](http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2012/november-web-only/in-defeats-evangelicals-more-politically-united-than-ever-b.html)\n\nDude, it's not even close.

No one knew what caused the spread of AIDS until the late-1980s, toward the end of his second term. Even in the last years of his presidency, it was not scientifically established that the disease was spread through sexual transmission. Reagan, it should be remembered, was a creature of Hollywood: he knew that it wasn't smart to discuss the issue supportingly, but he came from a culture where it was part of the landscape. He was close friends with Rock Hudson, and was one of the few people who knew of Hudson's homosexuality; it was Hudson's death from AIDS that caused Reagan to finally address the issue publicly. [Reagan's interior decorator in the White House was gay, and Reagan had him and his male partner/lover sleep over at the White House for Nancy's 60th.](http://igfculturewatch.com/2004/06/10/reagan-and-gays-a-reassessment/) Most importantly, as the 1978 California Briggs Initiative sought to ban gay teachers from the classroom, Reagan publicly opposed the initiative, stating that homosexuality is determined at early childhood if not before (even while he sought the White House, knowing it was a nationally unpopular position). \n\nDid Reagan pledge to end *Roe v. Wade*? Yes. But as Governor of California, he signed at least one bill allowing more permissive abortion laws. He never pushed legislation about abortion as President. Most tellingly, when choosing a Justice who he knew would be the determinative vote on overturning *Roe*, he selected O'Connor -- even knowing that she had backed pro-choice legislation as an Arizona legislator, and writing in his diary that she might not vote to end *Roe*. \n\nAs for the GOP \"doing what is has always done since Nixon's time\", I think you should look at Nixon's accomplishments as President. He opened trade with China, not exactly a conservative goal. He stridently backed the Clean Air Act, the creation of the EPA and OSHA, and his health care plan was arguably more liberal than Obama's (it included a stringent employer mandate, as well a setting prices for treatments and pharmaceuticals). He endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment. He got affirmatie action in federal contracts through the Philadelphia Plan. \n\nHe also did many evil, horrible, things; illegal bombings, Controlled Substances Act, terrible abuses of power, and so on. But he wasn't exactly the embodiment of the modern Republican party's agenda.

Republicans who are \"capitalism-enthusiasts\" can not truly agree with Tea Party people, who cannot truly agree with moderate Republicans who despise the religious right, who hates all of the above (except maybe the Tea Party). This isn't a platform, but the situation is much much worse that simply lacking a platform. \n\nThe democrats have long been a helter-skelter party of mixed, contradictory ideas and platforms (ban soft drinks!/legalize weed!), but liberals have become very rallied against contemporary conservatism, more so than conservatives are against Obama. To wit, conservatives rallied against Obama, but then fell to autocannibalism during their primary. Obama manged to use most of the language introduced in the primaries to dismantle Romney. Although most core liberals feel (correctly) that Obama is basically a moderate, the cries of \"commie\" from the Right motivated the hard-core liberal base, far more than the base of the right. \n\nMany intelligent people on the right are skeptical of the things claimed by the republican activists and talking heads. Most democrats are less skeptical of the left, simply because after Bush, Limbaugh, Beck and Co, anything the right says seems to be monstrous/belligerent/awful a priori. In effect, Fox has cried wolf so much that the Republican base is paranoid and has almost no reliable source for news and the Liberal base is firmly convinced in its own moral high ground: so convinced in fact, that conservatives arguments don't have to be debated as just more snow from Bullshit mountain. \n\nWhat I think will eventually happen is Christie or Bloomberg (my money on Christie, he played Sandy like a pro), will rally a moderate wing of the party together against a third democratic term, and grab numerous middle of the way democrats. That will produce a new republican candidate that might actually win a battle.\n\nThis hypothetical victory will be complicated by the right wing strategy of the last few years, that put Bush in power, but has been poisoning the well ever since. To win arguments Fox lies blatantly and debates strawmen. Most republican talking heads have adopted the Fox approach to facts. Conversely, Democrats have gone to critique through humor (Daily show matters a whole lot more than MSNBC) and thus captured the side with the better claim to truth (humor is or seems closer to truth than blatant lies). \n\nThis is the age-old strategies of the knave and the jester, respectively, both sides have done it for years, but the knave strategy common to republicans does not benefit from lies. (knave strategy being \"I say and suggest things that might seem morally wrong, but the world is bad and my values are good, and to achieve these values in the evil world, evil things must be done\" e.g. to save our children we must fuck over the poor)  \n\nFor cynicism/realpolitik to be an effective platform it must actually work, rather than be wistful thinking. If republicans continue to advocate an idealistic platform (if we put guns in the hands of teachers, school shootings will stop, because Chuck Norris), they will become the very thing they demonize: delusional tree-huggers (insert frakking in place of trees). If Republicans turn into hippies for world war against gays and marijuana, they are doomed to irrelevance.\n\nTL:DR Republicans have a few years left before the libertarians make a coalition with Wall Street and shut the fundamentalists out in the cold. Democrats will surely help the coalition along through pointless infighting, but the left will get a few decades of dominance.
