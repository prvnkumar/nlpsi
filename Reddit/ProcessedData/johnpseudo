Guaranteed health care, income support, social security - these things give people the freedom to avoid especially exploitative employment. It's why in places like Somalia the unemployment rate is essentially zero. Because of you don't work, even if that work is scavenging through trash, you simply die of exposure or starvation. \n\nI also think the OP is missing the big picture. Virtually every government spending program comes at the expense of corporations and the rich, because they are the primary source of tax revenue. That's why, for example, even though European tax policy is less progressive than u.s. tax policy, their government policy on the whole is far more progressive - because they simply raise far more taxes and spend far more on the poor. \n", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "johnpseudo", "id": "t1_cf20sf8", "parent_id": "t1_cf1tynb", "score": 9, "retrieved_on": 1432162883, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cf20sf8", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1391024234", "distinguished": null, "ups": 9}

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1o581s", "selftext": "&gt; Obamacare will allow insurers to charge 50 percent higher premiums for smokers, but prohibits insurers from increasing premiums for those with HIV/AIDS\n\nYes, with the logic being that you choose to smoke but don't choose to have HIV/AIDS. But most insurers aren't charging smokers 50% more, it's more like 15% more. Also, before Obamacare there weren't any limits at all. So she's phrasing it as if Obamacare is *making* them charge more when in fact it's *limiting* their ability to charge more.\n\n&gt;Nationally, Obamacare will increase men's individual insurance premiums by an average of 99 percent and women's by 62 percent.\n\nObviously this depends a lot on what kind of insurance you're getting and whether you were able to get insurance at all beforehand. A big reason the average premiums are going up is because comprehensive coverage is becoming much more affordable, leading more people to pay the higher premiums that are necessary for the upgrade from their current catastrophic-only plans. And comparisons like this one leave denials (which are now illegal) out entirely, although people who are denied coverage have infinitely-high premiums theoretically. They also tend to leave out the subsidies that most people get on the exchanges, which completely offset the cost of premiums for some people. And it leaves out the millions who will now be eligible for Medicaid, which is also free. So in summary, there's no meaningful comparison that can be done along these lines.\n\n&gt;Health plans valued at $27,500 or more for a family of four will be taxed at a rate of 40 percent.\n\nFirst, this doesn't take effect until 2018. Second, the logic here is to discourage unnecessary, wasteful medical care. Most insurers will simply scale back the generosity of their premium insurance plans rather than pay the tax. And that will result in a more equitable distribution of medical resources throughout the country. In fact, employers are already doing this, leading the CBO [in its most recent report to reduce its revenue projections from this tax by roughly half of its previous projection](http://taxfoundation.org/blog/obamacares-cadillac-tax-working-planned).\n\n&gt;No doctors who went to an American medical school will be accepting Obamacare.\n\nTotally absurd. Insurance plans offered on Obamacare's exchanges are being accepted everywhere.\n\n&gt;A 62-year-old man earning $46,000 a year is entitled to a $7,836 government tax credit to buy health insurance. But if he earns an extra $22 in income, he loses the entire $7,836 credit. He will have more take-home pay by earning $46,000 than if he earns $55,000.\n\nActually mostly true! He [only receives ~$2,923 in subsidies](http://kff.org/interactive/subsidy-calculator/#state=&amp;zip=&amp;income-type=dollars&amp;income=45900&amp;employer-coverage=0&amp;people=1&amp;adult-count=1&amp;adults%5B0%5D%5Bage%5D=62&amp;adults%5B0%5D%5Btobacco%5D=1&amp;adults%5B1%5D%5Bage%5D=21&amp;adults%5B1%5D%5Btobacco%5D=0&amp;adults%5B2%5D%5Bage%5D=21&amp;adults%5B2%5D%5Btobacco%5D=0&amp;adults%5B3%5D%5Bage%5D=21&amp;adults%5B3%5D%5Btobacco%5D=0&amp;child-count=0&amp;child-tobacco=0) just below the cut-off, but it's true that that subsidy suddenly drops to nothing if you make over 400% of the federal poverty level. The reason for this is that insurers are still allowed to charge higher premiums for older people (up to a limit). But the subsidies guarantee that you won't pay above 9.5% of your income on premiums if you're below 400% FPL. Since plans for old people cost significantly more than 9.5% of $46k, the cap makes a big difference and creates a big discontinuity here. Still, if you're a 62-year old individual without health insurance, Obamacare makes your life a lot easier. Before Obamacare, insurers would charge old people sky-high premiums. Now they can only charge 3x as much as their youngest customers.\n\n&gt;Merely to be eligible for millions of dollars in grants from the federal government under Obamacare, education and training programs are required to meet racial, ethnic, gender, linguistic and sexual orientation quotas.\n\nNo idea what she's talking about. Likely rantings of a lunatic.\n\n&gt;Obamacare is turning America into a part-time nation. According to a recent report by economist John Lott, 97 percent of all jobs added to the economy so far this year have been part-time jobs. Ninety-seven percent!\n\nThe actual number is 65% at this point in the year. And at the same time, [the vast majority of jobs](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/07/alan-krueger/alan-krueger-top-economist-obama-says-most-new-job/) created since Obamacare was enacted have been full-time.

The waiver is something Boehner specifically asked for, and it's a waiver from a requirement that Chuck Grassley inserted into Obamacare at the last minute to make a cheap political point.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Some states are making their own exchanges and have various state-specific names for those exchanges ([here's a map](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Maps-and-Data/State-Exchange-Map.aspx)). How they work is that insurance companies create insurance plans and offer them for you to buy on a website. They'll provide a standard price, but I believe it also depends on your age, whether you smoke, where you live, and your family composition (if you're buying a family plan). The plans offered on the exchanges will need to conform to one of five different categories - catastrophic (available only to people under the age of 30), bronze, silver, gold, or platinum. The distinction between bronze/silver/gold/platinum is what percentage of healthcare costs, on average, that will be paid by the plan rather than out of your own pocket. Bronze = 60%, Silver = 70%, Gold = 80%, and Platinum = 90%. Those averages are for the entire population covered by the plan- not on a person-by-person basis.\n\nIn addition to these average coverage levels, there will be annual caps on out-of-pocket expenses with the cap depending on your income and plan type (ask me or look [here](http://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/8061-021.pdf) for more details).\n\nIf your household income falls below 400% of the poverty line, after a price has been determined based on what plan you choose and your personal information you will also be offered subsidies to help pay for the plan. The total amount of subsidy you get is based on your household income and the cost of the second-lowest-cost \"silver\" plan available on the exchange. They basically offer enough subsidies such that the price you would pay for that second-lowest-price silver plan is capped at a certain percentage of your income (ask me or look [here](http://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/8061-021.pdf) for more information about that cap). Once that level of subsidy is determined, you are free to use the subsidy to buy whatever plan you want. So for example, if the silver plan costs $600/month, but subsidies bring that down to $200/month, you can instead get the $400/month bronze plan for free or the $800/month gold plan for $400/month.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind when you're comparing the exchange plans to the plans that are currently available is that the exchange plans will have significantly more protections and coverage than plans that are currently for sale. Insurance companies won't be able to kick you off on a technicality after you get sick or cap your benefits if they get too high or double your premiums after the first year. Because of those protections, premiums may be higher than before. But so far, premiums have been coming under what the CBO initially expected.\n\nAnyway, you can start shopping on the exchanges on October 1st for plans that will go into effect January 1st, 2014.

That's why it's part of phase one. It's a stop-gap to help people get covered until we have a better functioning individual insurance exchange. The fine I'm talking about is the high-cost insurance excise tax.

That's essentially what insurance is *supposed* to do, but it wasn't working that way before.\n\n&gt;Instead the ACA has set it up as a fall back for those not provided insurance by their employer.\n\n~~That's true in the short-term (i.e. the next 10 years). But that begins to reverse course over time.~~\n\n~~You have to understand the intense political pressures that Democrats were under *not* to touch employer-provided health insurance. The best they could do is to leave an extremely gradual mechanism in there to push people away from employer insurance.

But that begins to reverse course over time.\n\nIn the context of current law there is nothing to make this happen, nor do I see it happening organically. Under the current law, employers are required to offer health insurance of pay a penalty, thus heavily incentivizing them to offer health insurance. The exchanges are only comparable in price to employer offered health insurance if they are government subsidized. Individuals only get this subsidization if their employer does *not* offer insurance.\n\nThis gives us a breakdown of employers are heavily encouraged to offer health insurance, individuals are heavily encourage to take this employer offered insurance, and the exchanges are there to catch those who fall through the cracks. None of the provisions of the ACA that propel this cycle have an expiration data. As I see it the ACA is further entrenching employer sponsored health insurance. \n\nIt sounds to me like you are arguing that future legislation will be passed to build upon and things the ACA set up (like the exchanges).

It works in phases. First, the focus is providing universal coverage, through a combination of expanding Medicaid, setting up a subsidized individual insurance marketplace, and mandating employers either cover their employees or pay a small fine (this is a very small percentage of the overall plan). This is important, because a big reason why employer-provided insurance is so popular right now is because the individual insurance market is totally dysfunctional.~~\n\n~~During the next phase, the \"cadillac plan tax\" starts taking effect. Starting in 2018, this tax charges employers a fine of 40% on the value of their health insurance plans over a certain threshold. At first, this tax only applies to certain expensive healthcare plans offered through employers. For example, currently [only 19% of employer-provided health plans fall over the threshold](http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/stories/2010/march/18/cadillac-tax-explainer-update.aspx). But after it goes into effect, that threshold will grow only at the rate of inflation, even though premiums have tended to grow at roughly 3-5% higher than that each year.

The exchanges are only comparable in price to employer offered health insurance if they are government subsidized.

None of the provisions of the ACA that propel this cycle have an expiration data. As I see it the ACA is further entrenching employer sponsored health insurance. \n\nIt sounds to me like you are arguing that future legislation will be passed to build upon and things the ACA set up (like the exchanges).

I especially like the part where he dismisses [all the popular red herrings](http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/what-makes-the-us-health-care-system-so-expensive-red-herrings/): it isn't because we're more unhealthy, or because we're older, or because of malpractice insurance.\n\nAnd **[our quality of treatment is not one of the best in the world](http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/how-do-we-rate-the-quality-of-the-us-health-care-system-introduction/)**. For practically any metric (wait times, access to doctors, patient satisfaction, doctor satisfaction, death rates from diseases), the United States ranks near the middle or even below average.\n\nThe problem is actually very complicated, but the best explanation I've heard so far is that the United States doesn't have a single large intermediary in the healthcare system that is both empowered and given the right incentive to control system-wide costs. In most developed nations, the government plays that role with simple price restrictions or government-provided care. In the United States, you'd hope that insurance companies would play that role, but their business strategy largely focuses on minimizing exposure to costs (i.e. externalizing those costs) rather than preventing those costs from being incurred.\n\nPart of Obamacare's objective is to reorient the insurance industry so that their business model focuses more on controlling costs, by making it more difficult to externalize costs onto the government or patients. Before Obamacare, if a patient got really sick they'd eventually hit their annual or lifetime maximum, or be kicked off coverage due to a pre-existing condition, subsequently ending up on Medicaid or a state high-risk pool (or simply with no coverage). Now, if a patient has insurance and gets really sick, the insurance company has to keep them on their books. That gives them a big incentive to keep their customers healthy and to reduce costs in the event that they do get really sick.\n\nBut there are other factors that don't fit neatly into that explanation. The financing structure of medical education is extremely skewed, leading to higher doctors salaries and fewer doctors. The \"scope of practice\" laws that we have limit what physician assistants and nurse practitioners can do, making that shortage of doctors all the more costly. There are cultural issues surrounding how we handle childbirth and death that result in poor planning and overspending. Doctors are often compensated on a per-procedure basis rather than based on the health of their patient. So there are a lot of things that need to be fixed, but it would all be easier if there were a single powerful intermediary (like the government) whose job it was to fix these things.", "id": "t1_cbfgnsu", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "johnpseudo", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1jjm8t", "score": 10, "retrieved_on": 1429971188, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1375463109, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1jjm8t", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cbfgnsu", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1375447467", "ups": 10, "distinguished": null}

I know it's an absurd question but I'm posing an extreme example to you only to emphasize the point about the shortcomings of approaching voting as realpolitik.\n\nProbably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted]. Pol Pot killed about 25% of his population in 4 years whereas Stalin killed only 10-20% of his population over 30 years. That's a big difference! But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\n&gt;we don't live in a society that separates their moral judgments from their voting judgements.\n\nI disagree. People are highly strategic in their voting judgments, and a very high percentage of voters do so despite feeling that they're choosing between the \"lesser of two evils\".\n\n&gt;Of course not (this is a straw man argument, I don't reject the process of voting, on the contrary I want to improve it!)\n\nI mean the voting process *in its current state*.

Their political clout comes primarily through a well-funded lobbying effort and their loyalty tests in the Republican primary.\n\n&gt;They've only pushed this issue when they knew their bill was a non-starter, how is that not a greenwash?\n\nBut it's almost *always* been a non-starter, and that's almost exclusively due to the inflexible positions taken by Republicans. The scarce few moments it's actually had a chance have had to be shared with several other vitally important issues that were just seeing a glimmer of the light of day. Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\". You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nThe obstruction of Republicans is *far* more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.", "id": "t1_cb7syi2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "johnpseudo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt; Probably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted].

But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\nBy taking this position you've essentially admitted that your position is non-viable (go try to convince Joe America that you're justified in your willingness to vote for either Stalin or Pol Pot.) I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality? Is it not entirely self-evident (from your POV) that voters care about these issues?\n\n&gt;By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\nI've explicitly disclaimed this notion in the CMV post, and in previous responses to you. How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

Trust me, I actively avoid being marked as \"strong reject\". As for invalid ballots, I don't know who you listen to but I've heard democrats talk about election reform most when they make the observation that invalid votes are being cast (and that they know that most of those votes were intended for them.)  The newtime voter id laws are a great example of that. It clearly creates an incentive for them to pursue election reform when I present an invalid ballot.\n\n&gt;On a public basis...\n\nI don't see how any of this passage is pertinent.

Do you even have one?\n\nBut we don't have to compare our experiences in politics for me to be skeptical of your point. If candidates don't care about invalid votes, why would they ever move on the issue of election reform anyway?

Please engage with the example and substantiate your point further so that I can respond.\n\n&gt;Have you any reason for doubting their sincerity other than your complaint about the ~3 months in 2009 when you think they could have passed election reform?\n\nI would have to go back to a completely different caucus and then we're just going to argue about the pertinence of the example... the last time Democrats controlled all three houses before that congress would have been before the midterms in Clinton's second term.

I know it's an absurd question but I'm posing an extreme example to you only to emphasize the point about the shortcomings of approaching voting as realpolitik.\n\nProbably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted]. Pol Pot killed about 25% of his population in 4 years whereas Stalin killed only 10-20% of his population over 30 years. That's a big difference! But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\n&gt;we don't live in a society that separates their moral judgments from their voting judgements.\n\nI disagree. People are highly strategic in their voting judgments, and a very high percentage of voters do so despite feeling that they're choosing between the \"lesser of two evils\".\n\n&gt;Of course not (this is a straw man argument, I don't reject the process of voting, on the contrary I want to improve it!)\n\nI mean the voting process *in its current state*. By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\n&gt;My example was the NRA (an extremely effective organizing group that serves an influential bloc of single-issue voters.)\n\nNRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election. Their political clout comes primarily through a well-funded lobbying effort and their loyalty tests in the Republican primary.\n\n&gt;They've only pushed this issue when they knew their bill was a non-starter, how is that not a greenwash?\n\nBut it's almost *always* been a non-starter, and that's almost exclusively due to the inflexible positions taken by Republicans. The scarce few moments it's actually had a chance have had to be shared with several other vitally important issues that were just seeing a glimmer of the light of day. Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\". You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nThe obstruction of Republicans is *far* more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.", "id": "t1_cb7syi2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "johnpseudo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt; Probably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted].

But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\nBy taking this position you've essentially admitted that your position is non-viable (go try to convince Joe America that you're justified in your willingness to vote for either Stalin or Pol Pot.) I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality? Is it not entirely self-evident (from your POV) that voters care about these issues?\n\n&gt;By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\nI've explicitly disclaimed this notion in the CMV post, and in previous responses to you. How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

Trust me, I actively avoid being marked as \"strong reject\". As for invalid ballots, I don't know who you listen to but I've heard democrats talk about election reform most when they make the observation that invalid votes are being cast (and that they know that most of those votes were intended for them.)

Do you even have one?\n\nBut we don't have to compare our experiences in politics for me to be skeptical of your point. If candidates don't care about invalid votes, why would they ever move on the issue of election reform anyway? Thats why I cited movetoamend.org: they have a realistic goal that doesn't involve passing a bill through the three houses, and has the potential to enact real election reform.\n\nEdit: sorry about the long delay and poor formating/spelling.

You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nThe obstruction of Republicans is *far* more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.", "id": "t1_cb7syi2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "johnpseudo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt; Probably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted]. Pol Pot killed about 25% of his population in 4 years whereas Stalin killed only 10-20% of his population over 30 years. That's a big difference! But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\nBy taking this position you've essentially admitted that your position is non-viable (go try to convince Joe America that you're justified in your willingness to vote for either Stalin or Pol Pot.) I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality? Is it not entirely self-evident (from your POV) that voters care about these issues?\n\n&gt;By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\nI've explicitly disclaimed this notion in the CMV post, and in previous responses to you. How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

Maybe if the votes didn't have equal *weighting* or something.

From a purely practical perspective, they care much more about votes registered to one of the two major political parties. Protest votes just aren't a very reliable metric when trying to guess how much success any particular candidate or campaign platform is going to have. A well-funded candidate is going to start with the two-party results breakdown of past races, then if they have enough money they'll pay for some research about what the three most important issues are for voters in their district.

People are highly strategic in their voting judgments, and a very high percentage of voters do so despite feeling that they're choosing between the \"lesser of two evils\".\n\n&gt;Of course not (this is a straw man argument, I don't reject the process of voting, on the contrary I want to improve it!)\n\nI mean the voting process *in its current state*. By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\n&gt;My example was the NRA (an extremely effective organizing group that serves an influential bloc of single-issue voters.)\n\nNRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election. Their political clout comes primarily through a well-funded lobbying effort and their loyalty tests in the Republican primary.\n\n&gt;They've only pushed this issue when they knew their bill was a non-starter, how is that not a greenwash?\n\nBut it's almost *always* been a non-starter, and that's almost exclusively due to the inflexible positions taken by Republicans. The scarce few moments it's actually had a chance have had to be shared with several other vitally important issues that were just seeing a glimmer of the light of day. Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\". You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nThe obstruction of Republicans is *far* more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.", "id": "t1_cb7syi2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "johnpseudo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt; Probably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted].

But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\nBy taking this position you've essentially admitted that your position is non-viable (go try to convince Joe America that you're justified in your willingness to vote for either Stalin or Pol Pot.) I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality? Is it not entirely self-evident (from your POV) that voters care about these issues?\n\n&gt;By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\nI've explicitly disclaimed this notion in the CMV post, and in previous responses to you. How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

Please respond.\n\nEdit: \n\n&gt;That seems like something a politician would say if they're already fans of election reform.\n\nWhy is that worth commenting on? A great deal of what you've said thus far could easily have been said by a partisan congressional democrat but I don't see the pertinence of either comment. If your point is that something like Bush v Gore wasn't a wake up call to politicians who weren't cognizant of the major problems our election system has institutionalized then I don't really see where you're getting that from.", "id": "t1_cb7rc4v", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt; You're right, what would really help is if they were sincere about wanting it.\n\nHave you any reason for doubting their sincerity other than your complaint about the ~3 months in 2009 when you think they could have passed election reform?\n\n&gt;how is single-issue voting on election reform less legitimate than on other issues?\n\nI never said it was. They're all ineffective uses of the vote.\n\n&gt;what is the line that a candidate must cross before you will refuse to vote for them under any circumstance?\n\nI already answered that:\n\n&gt;That depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that. If polls were to say that only 10-20% of the population supports [crossing that line], and that the issue is very important, I could see how abstaining from voting and focusing on getting a new constitutional convention would make sense. But if polls were to say that 70-80% of the population supports [crossing that line], then abstaining from the vote isn't going to accomplish anything.\n\nSo no, there's no line that, if crossed, would lead me to think that abstaining from the vote would be a good decision. It depends on the degree to which that objectionable policy is accepted by the rest of the country. I already am shocked/outraged/disgusted by much of what the government does, but unless a lot of other people feel the same way, that doesn't make rejecting the entire voting process any more of a viable a way of changing the system.

Please engage with the example and substantiate your point further so that I can respond.\n\n&gt;Have you any reason for doubting their sincerity other than your complaint about the ~3 months in 2009 when you think they could have passed election reform?\n\nI would have to go back to a completely different caucus and then we're just going to argue about the pertinence of the example... the last time Democrats controlled all three houses before that congress would have been before the midterms in Clinton's second term.

I know it's an absurd question but I'm posing an extreme example to you only to emphasize the point about the shortcomings of approaching voting as realpolitik.\n\nProbably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted]. Pol Pot killed about 25% of his population in 4 years whereas Stalin killed only 10-20% of his population over 30 years. That's a big difference! But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\n&gt;we don't live in a society that separates their moral judgments from their voting judgements.\n\nI disagree. People are highly strategic in their voting judgments, and a very high percentage of voters do so despite feeling that they're choosing between the \"lesser of two evils\".\n\n&gt;Of course not (this is a straw man argument, I don't reject the process of voting, on the contrary I want to improve it!)\n\nI mean the voting process *in its current state*.

The scarce few moments it's actually had a chance have had to be shared with several other vitally important issues that were just seeing a glimmer of the light of day. Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\". You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nThe obstruction of Republicans is *far* more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.", "id": "t1_cb7syi2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "johnpseudo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt; Probably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted].

But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\nBy taking this position you've essentially admitted that your position is non-viable (go try to convince Joe America that you're justified in your willingness to vote for either Stalin or Pol Pot.) I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality? Is it not entirely self-evident (from your POV) that voters care about these issues?\n\n&gt;By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\nI've explicitly disclaimed this notion in the CMV post, and in previous responses to you. How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

Trust me, I actively avoid being marked as \"strong reject\". As for invalid ballots, I don't know who you listen to but I've heard democrats talk about election reform most when they make the observation that invalid votes are being cast (and that they know that most of those votes were intended for them.)  The newtime voter id laws are a great example of that. It clearly creates an incentive for them to pursue election reform when I present an invalid ballot.\n\n&gt;On a public basis...\n\nI don't see how any of this passage is pertinent.

I would rather you answer my fundamental question to you: what is the line that a candidate must cross before you will refuse to vote for them under any circumstance? Do you even have one?\n\nBut we don't have to compare our experiences in politics for me to be skeptical of your point. If candidates don't care about invalid votes, why would they ever move on the issue of election reform anyway? Thats why I cited movetoamend.org: they have a realistic goal that doesn't involve passing a bill through the three houses, and has the potential to enact real election reform.\n\nEdit: sorry about the long delay and poor formating/spelling.

Please respond.\n\nEdit: \n\n&gt;That seems like something a politician would say if they're already fans of election reform.\n\nWhy is that worth commenting on? A great deal of what you've said thus far could easily have been said by a partisan congressional democrat but I don't see the pertinence of either comment.

I know it's an absurd question but I'm posing an extreme example to you only to emphasize the point about the shortcomings of approaching voting as realpolitik.\n\nProbably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted]. Pol Pot killed about 25% of his population in 4 years whereas Stalin killed only 10-20% of his population over 30 years. That's a big difference! But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\n&gt;we don't live in a society that separates their moral judgments from their voting judgements.\n\nI disagree. People are highly strategic in their voting judgments, and a very high percentage of voters do so despite feeling that they're choosing between the \"lesser of two evils\".\n\n&gt;Of course not (this is a straw man argument, I don't reject the process of voting, on the contrary I want to improve it!)\n\nI mean the voting process *in its current state*.

The scarce few moments it's actually had a chance have had to be shared with several other vitally important issues that were just seeing a glimmer of the light of day. Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\". You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nThe obstruction of Republicans is *far* more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.", "id": "t1_cb7syi2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "johnpseudo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt; Probably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted].

I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality? Is it not entirely self-evident (from your POV) that voters care about these issues?\n\n&gt;By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\nI've explicitly disclaimed this notion in the CMV post, and in previous responses to you. How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

People use that term to refer to how people respond to polls, which is irrelevant to how your 'invalid' is perceived after the election results roll in.\n\nIf you respond to polls as undecided, that's good and you'll get more attention. If you respond as \"I view the candidate to be unacceptable\", which is what I thought your stance was, you'll get recorded as a \"strong reject\", which will lead to your getting ignored.\n\n&gt; Isn't the whole point of debate to win people over to your side? If we've given up on discourse then how can one expect to have a functional and representative government? Why do we have elections in the first place, in your view?

Trust me, I actively avoid being marked as \"strong reject\". As for invalid ballots, I don't know who you listen to but I've heard democrats talk about election reform most when they make the observation that invalid votes are being cast (and that they know that most of those votes were intended for them.)  The newtime voter id laws are a great example of that. It clearly creates an incentive for them to pursue election reform when I present an invalid ballot.\n\n&gt;On a public basis...\n\nI don't see how any of this passage is pertinent. I'm not walking away from these candidates because they aren't sending me a car to take me to the polling place or spending a dime on me. I'm walking away from their policies. I use all available information to the best of my ability.\n\n&gt;which is what I thought your stance was\n\nIt is my stance but as far as I'm concerned people are crazy for not doing everything they can (including tell blatant lies) in order to get marked down by pollsters as undecided. Anything else is just asking to be ignored and there is absolutely no duty or rational reason to be honest to pollsters (they already consider your statements biased by self-selection.)\n\n&gt;You're confusing...\n\nI'm not confusing anything or talking about how candidates do anything except when you challenge me on that basis (refer to my above point about how invalid ballots are viewed by democrats as 'votes left on the table.') I would rather you answer my fundamental question to you: what is the line that a candidate must cross before you will refuse to vote for them under any circumstance? Do you even have one?\n\nBut we don't have to compare our experiences in politics for me to be skeptical of your point. If candidates don't care about invalid votes, why would they ever move on the issue of election reform anyway? Thats why I cited movetoamend.org: they have a realistic goal that doesn't involve passing a bill through the three houses, and has the potential to enact real election reform.\n\nEdit: sorry about the long delay and poor formating/spelling.

You've got the Democratic party, which actively pushes election reform any time there's a chance it would work. You started out by trying to use the DISCLOSE Act as an example of good legislation that Democrats refused to pass. The actual vote shows that it was actually all Democrats vs. all Republicans. It just seems to me that what we need is more Democrats in power, so that they can either pass it unilaterally or an extended period of political irrelevance will force Republicans to reform their party.

To say that what I'm doing isn't a viable or effective ignores the enormous influence already garnered by organizers who espouse the usage of this tactic (e.g. the NRA.)\n\nPoint of process: I have made an effort to respond to each of your points in every case, and offered to address any point you feel unsatisfied with in greater depth.

Please respond.\n\nEdit: \n\n&gt;That seems like something a politician would say if they're already fans of election reform.\n\nWhy is that worth commenting on? A great deal of what you've said thus far could easily have been said by a partisan congressional democrat but I don't see the pertinence of either comment.

If polls were to say that only 10-20% of the population supports [crossing that line], and that the issue is very important, I could see how abstaining from voting and focusing on getting a new constitutional convention would make sense.

I know it's an absurd question but I'm posing an extreme example to you only to emphasize the point about the shortcomings of approaching voting as realpolitik.\n\nProbably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted]. Pol Pot killed about 25% of his population in 4 years whereas Stalin killed only 10-20% of his population over 30 years. That's a big difference! But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\n&gt;we don't live in a society that separates their moral judgments from their voting judgements.\n\nI disagree. People are highly strategic in their voting judgments, and a very high percentage of voters do so despite feeling that they're choosing between the \"lesser of two evils\".\n\n&gt;Of course not (this is a straw man argument, I don't reject the process of voting, on the contrary I want to improve it!)\n\nI mean the voting process *in its current state*.

The scarce few moments it's actually had a chance have had to be shared with several other vitally important issues that were just seeing a glimmer of the light of day. Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\". You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nThe obstruction of Republicans is *far* more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.", "id": "t1_cb7syi2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "johnpseudo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt; Probably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted].

I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality? Is it not entirely self-evident (from your POV) that voters care about these issues?\n\n&gt;By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\nI've explicitly disclaimed this notion in the CMV post, and in previous responses to you. How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

I know it's an absurd question but I'm posing an extreme example to you only to emphasize the point about the shortcomings of approaching voting as realpolitik.\n\nProbably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted]. Pol Pot killed about 25% of his population in 4 years whereas Stalin killed only 10-20% of his population over 30 years. That's a big difference! But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\n&gt;we don't live in a society that separates their moral judgments from their voting judgements.\n\nI disagree. People are highly strategic in their voting judgments, and a very high percentage of voters do so despite feeling that they're choosing between the \"lesser of two evils\".\n\n&gt;Of course not (this is a straw man argument, I don't reject the process of voting, on the contrary I want to improve it!)\n\nI mean the voting process *in its current state*. By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\n&gt;My example was the NRA (an extremely effective organizing group that serves an influential bloc of single-issue voters.)\n\nNRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election. Their political clout comes primarily through a well-funded lobbying effort and their loyalty tests in the Republican primary.\n\n&gt;They've only pushed this issue when they knew their bill was a non-starter, how is that not a greenwash?\n\nBut it's almost *always* been a non-starter, and that's almost exclusively due to the inflexible positions taken by Republicans. The scarce few moments it's actually had a chance have had to be shared with several other vitally important issues that were just seeing a glimmer of the light of day. Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\". You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nThe obstruction of Republicans is *far* more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.", "id": "t1_cb7syi2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "johnpseudo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt; Probably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted].

But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\nBy taking this position you've essentially admitted that your position is non-viable (go try to convince Joe America that you're justified in your willingness to vote for either Stalin or Pol Pot.) I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality? Is it not entirely self-evident (from your POV) that voters care about these issues?\n\n&gt;By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\nI've explicitly disclaimed this notion in the CMV post, and in previous responses to you. How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?'

They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen.

Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

As in 'this one gets my vote, I want her!'\n\nSee, you're implying the \"I want her\" part. A vote is just an effort to improve the chances that the person you're voting for is elected. That doesn't preclude the possibility that you'd prefer someone else to be elected who either isn't on the ballot or doesn't have a realistic chance of winning. It's just a strategic decision to support one candidate over the other, regardless of how inadequate the choices are.\n\n&gt;Secret ballots, nobody finds out until afterward.\n\nThe outcome of elections is highly correlated with the outcome of public opinion polls.

Can't speak for the future.\n\nYou can vote in whatever district you want?\n\n&gt;when I abstain from a given election I would hardly call that meaningless much less useless.\n\nYes, that's the heart of our disagreement.

The votes of politicians in Congress are enormously important. What is the consequence of your not voting? Maybe you feel better about yourself. Maybe a few of your like-minded friends understand and appreciate what you did. But nobody else is going to get your \"message\".

So you aren't going to be able to \"enforce your will\" over the objections of everyone else.\n\nWe're back to what I would call a nihilistic view of voting here.

That I am only useful inasmuch as my faction is powerful.\n\n&gt;But we have a moral obligation to enact that small, marginal impact to the best of our abilities.\n\nYeah that's my point exactly. You have a moral duty to express your point of view through voting. I, for one, am not for condoning the actions of government when they commit crimes against humanity or when they subvert the processes of government or countermand their basis for legitimacy (the constitution.)\n\nEdit:\n\n&gt;No. That moral complicity is yours whether or not you vote, merely by virtue of the fact that you are a U.S. citizen.\n\nYou're telling me that if we elect Adolf Hitler that the people who vote for him are equally blameworthy (morally) as the people who vote against him?

More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?'

They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know.

Your vote counts for one person and can *only be cast once, and only for one person, and only from one person per person per election*.

Their political clout comes primarily through a well-funded lobbying effort and their loyalty tests in the Republican primary.\n\n&gt;They've only pushed this issue when they knew their bill was a non-starter, how is that not a greenwash?\n\nBut it's almost *always* been a non-starter, and that's almost exclusively due to the inflexible positions taken by Republicans. The scarce few moments it's actually had a chance have had to be shared with several other vitally important issues that were just seeing a glimmer of the light of day. Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\". You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nThe obstruction of Republicans is *far* more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.", "id": "t1_cb7syi2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "johnpseudo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt; Probably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted]. Pol Pot killed about 25% of his population in 4 years whereas Stalin killed only 10-20% of his population over 30 years. That's a big difference! But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\nBy taking this position you've essentially admitted that your position is non-viable (go try to convince Joe America that you're justified in your willingness to vote for either Stalin or Pol Pot.) I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality? Is it not entirely self-evident (from your POV) that voters care about these issues?\n\n&gt;By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\nI've explicitly disclaimed this notion in the CMV post, and in previous responses to you. How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

Just as they were nearing the finish line, Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nYes I was paying attention in '09. Did you notice that Harry Reid had an opportunity to change the Senate rules on filibuster? The Democrats are only locked down in the Senate because they got their priorities mixed up. Harry Reid is *just now* looking at the 'nuclear' option in **2013** (and even then only for judicial appointments, the republicans WILL NOT stop at appointments and Reid knows that he's opening the door for a full blown nuclear option when/if they retake the Senate.) And now they're rolling back implementation even on what they DID get done. These people in the party establishment aren't serious about governing with liberal policies. \n\n&gt;Because that's the way the fucking useless Senate is designed- to allow a determined minority to delay everything practically forever.\n\nNot really. The Senate wasn't designed to require a 60 vote supermajority and you're well aware of that. They had time to pass landmark healthcare, they could have spent that time on filibuster reform and the past 5 years would have gone quite a bit differently (and they would have been able to pass healthcare anyway.) But as an institution they have no spine.\n\n&gt;And of course President Obama didn't have complete freedom to do whatever he wanted. \n\nI'm not saying that he did.\n\n&gt;I could easily imagine someone like Max Baucus or Joe Lieberman throwing up an objection which would have brought the whole thing to an end.\n\nThey spent more time on Bernie Sanders than on 'moderates' like Lieberman from the reportage I was seeing. That makes sense because Sanders is a socialist and as a party the democrats had long supported single-payer (because it actually makes sense in the context of the Democratic party's ideology and philosophical underpinnings) and he was horrified to see a deal that essentially created a new (and captive) market for private insurers. I think they hammered out a particular provision with Baucus but memory escapes me what it was.\n\n&gt;If even a single Democratic Senator was opposed, it wouldn't get through the Senate.\n\nWell who am I to hold accountable for that other than Harry Reid? If Democrats had championed filibuster reform *first* they could still have been *governing* today, but that isn't what they're interested in doing. They can't even police their own party: after gun control flopped at the beginning of this term the major donors pushed for culling the bluedogs from party funding and even THAT was no go. This is the gang who can't shoot straight.\n\n&gt;For all the horrible flaws Lieberman had, it was still useful to have him in office rather than a Republican (he did vote for Obamacare, the stimulus, and many other useful pieces of legislation after all).\n\nIrrelevant. He's an independent, and we're talking about Democrats. Besides, useful legislation? A lot of these guys pretend to be moderates but he himself (and quite a few Democrats) [was drinking the neoconservative kool aid.](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00236)\n\nI agree that voters should look at the affirmative arguments for a given candidate but shouldn't they also look at the negative? I don't think somebody like Reid is worth voting for if he's going to get up and pretend to represent the 'liberal' party and then use that position to reauthorize the neoconservative policies of the Bush administration, all the while crying crocodile tears about the republican obstructionism he chose to subject his party to.\n\n&gt;Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nWere *you* paying attention in 2009? Scott Brown '09 is a showpiece for my point about the role of money in politics. Anybody who was watching the money had a good sense that Brown was going to win that one.\n\nJust so the question is clear: how much is too much for you? If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for? I'm not comfortable saying 'my vote is for double-taps and soft money in government and an institution that can't enforce its will or even keep it's leadership on-message.' So no, the D's can earn my vote as individuals but I'm very skeptical about the institution of their party (likewise Republicans, the Tea Party, The Green Party). Aren't liberals such as yourself better served by supporting individual candidates and not the party?

What makes you think of the vote as an endorsement?\n\n&gt;If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for?\n\nThat depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that. If polls were to say that only 10-20% of the population supports shooting first responders, and that the issue is very important, I could see how abstaining from voting and focusing on getting a new constitutional convention would make sense.

Your vote counts for one person and can *only be cast once, and only for one person, and only from one person per person per election*. You can only vote *affirmatively* and therefore may not express preference, whereas in instant runoff voting none of the above is true and one MAY express preference by listing their preferences in order. When write-in ballots are permitted I always participate on the basis of the above rationale and that scenario presenting an exception to the same. Isn't voting clearly a selection? As in 'this one gets my vote, I want her!' In order to express the political will consistent with the expression 'I want this one but if I can't have it that way I'll take Nixon instead and then if they both lose I'll take Pol Pot' in the form of a ballot one would necessarily require a runoff style ballot would they not?\n\n&gt;That depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that.\n\nWhat the hell does that mean? We're voting, it's decision time. Secret ballots, nobody finds out until afterward. As to the point about polling you're missing the point. If voting is a meaningful expression of your political will at all then does it not affix some moral complicity to the voter when the government they put into office acts? If you're telling me that when you vote you do not make a moral affirmation of the candidate that has earned your vote then how do you enforce your will that your government should be a force for good? (I don't vote for candidates that I believe will engage in crimes against humanity such as double-taps. This is an extremely low bar.) We don't make moral judgments as a group we make them as individuals.\n\n&gt;I would never donate money to or actively promote a conservative Democrat in another state.\n\nLike I said, D triple C money is still flowing freely to these people.

Trust me, I actively avoid being marked as \"strong reject\". As for invalid ballots, I don't know who you listen to but I've heard democrats talk about election reform most when they make the observation that invalid votes are being cast (and that they know that most of those votes were intended for them.)  The newtime voter id laws are a great example of that. It clearly creates an incentive for them to pursue election reform when I present an invalid ballot.\n\n&gt;On a public basis...\n\nI don't see how any of this passage is pertinent. I'm not walking away from these candidates because they aren't sending me a car to take me to the polling place or spending a dime on me. I'm walking away from their policies. I use all available information to the best of my ability.\n\n&gt;which is what I thought your stance was\n\nIt is my stance but as far as I'm concerned people are crazy for not doing everything they can (including tell blatant lies) in order to get marked down by pollsters as undecided. Anything else is just asking to be ignored and there is absolutely no duty or rational reason to be honest to pollsters (they already consider your statements biased by self-selection.)\n\n&gt;You're confusing...\n\nI'm not confusing anything or talking about how candidates do anything except when you challenge me on that basis (refer to my above point about how invalid ballots are viewed by democrats as 'votes left on the table.') I would rather you answer my fundamental question to you: what is the line that a candidate must cross before you will refuse to vote for them under any circumstance? Do you even have one?\n\nBut we don't have to compare our experiences in politics for me to be skeptical of your point. If candidates don't care about invalid votes, why would they ever move on the issue of election reform anyway? Thats why I cited movetoamend.org: they have a realistic goal that doesn't involve passing a bill through the three houses, and has the potential to enact real election reform.\n\nEdit: sorry about the long delay and poor formating/spelling.

You started out by trying to use the DISCLOSE Act as an example of good legislation that Democrats refused to pass. The actual vote shows that it was actually all Democrats vs. all Republicans. It just seems to me that what we need is more Democrats in power, so that they can either pass it unilaterally or an extended period of political irrelevance will force Republicans to reform their party.

To say that what I'm doing isn't a viable or effective ignores the enormous influence already garnered by organizers who espouse the usage of this tactic (e.g. the NRA.)\n\nPoint of process: I have made an effort to respond to each of your points in every case, and offered to address any point you feel unsatisfied with in greater depth.

A great deal of what you've said thus far could easily have been said by a partisan congressional democrat but I don't see the pertinence of either comment.

If polls were to say that only 10-20% of the population supports [crossing that line], and that the issue is very important, I could see how abstaining from voting and focusing on getting a new constitutional convention would make sense.

I know it's an absurd question but I'm posing an extreme example to you only to emphasize the point about the shortcomings of approaching voting as realpolitik.\n\nProbably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted]. Pol Pot killed about 25% of his population in 4 years whereas Stalin killed only 10-20% of his population over 30 years. That's a big difference! But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\n&gt;we don't live in a society that separates their moral judgments from their voting judgements.\n\nI disagree. People are highly strategic in their voting judgments, and a very high percentage of voters do so despite feeling that they're choosing between the \"lesser of two evils\".\n\n&gt;Of course not (this is a straw man argument, I don't reject the process of voting, on the contrary I want to improve it!)\n\nI mean the voting process *in its current state*.

The scarce few moments it's actually had a chance have had to be shared with several other vitally important issues that were just seeing a glimmer of the light of day. Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\". You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nThe obstruction of Republicans is *far* more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.", "id": "t1_cb7syi2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "johnpseudo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt; Probably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted].

I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality? Is it not entirely self-evident (from your POV) that voters care about these issues?\n\n&gt;By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\nI've explicitly disclaimed this notion in the CMV post, and in previous responses to you. How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

Did you notice that Harry Reid had an opportunity to change the Senate rules on filibuster? The Democrats are only locked down in the Senate because they got their priorities mixed up. Harry Reid is *just now* looking at the 'nuclear' option in **2013** (and even then only for judicial appointments, the republicans WILL NOT stop at appointments and Reid knows that he's opening the door for a full blown nuclear option when/if they retake the Senate.) And now they're rolling back implementation even on what they DID get done. These people in the party establishment aren't serious about governing with liberal policies. \n\n&gt;Because that's the way the fucking useless Senate is designed- to allow a determined minority to delay everything practically forever.\n\nNot really. The Senate wasn't designed to require a 60 vote supermajority and you're well aware of that. They had time to pass landmark healthcare, they could have spent that time on filibuster reform and the past 5 years would have gone quite a bit differently (and they would have been able to pass healthcare anyway.) But as an institution they have no spine.\n\n&gt;And of course President Obama didn't have complete freedom to do whatever he wanted. \n\nI'm not saying that he did.\n\n&gt;I could easily imagine someone like Max Baucus or Joe Lieberman throwing up an objection which would have brought the whole thing to an end.\n\nThey spent more time on Bernie Sanders than on 'moderates' like Lieberman from the reportage I was seeing. That makes sense because Sanders is a socialist and as a party the democrats had long supported single-payer (because it actually makes sense in the context of the Democratic party's ideology and philosophical underpinnings) and he was horrified to see a deal that essentially created a new (and captive) market for private insurers. I think they hammered out a particular provision with Baucus but memory escapes me what it was.\n\n&gt;If even a single Democratic Senator was opposed, it wouldn't get through the Senate.\n\nWell who am I to hold accountable for that other than Harry Reid? If Democrats had championed filibuster reform *first* they could still have been *governing* today, but that isn't what they're interested in doing. They can't even police their own party: after gun control flopped at the beginning of this term the major donors pushed for culling the bluedogs from party funding and even THAT was no go. This is the gang who can't shoot straight.\n\n&gt;For all the horrible flaws Lieberman had, it was still useful to have him in office rather than a Republican (he did vote for Obamacare, the stimulus, and many other useful pieces of legislation after all).\n\nIrrelevant. He's an independent, and we're talking about Democrats. Besides, useful legislation? A lot of these guys pretend to be moderates but he himself (and quite a few Democrats) [was drinking the neoconservative kool aid.](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00236)\n\nI agree that voters should look at the affirmative arguments for a given candidate but shouldn't they also look at the negative? I don't think somebody like Reid is worth voting for if he's going to get up and pretend to represent the 'liberal' party and then use that position to reauthorize the neoconservative policies of the Bush administration, all the while crying crocodile tears about the republican obstructionism he chose to subject his party to.\n\n&gt;Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nWere *you* paying attention in 2009? Scott Brown '09 is a showpiece for my point about the role of money in politics. Anybody who was watching the money had a good sense that Brown was going to win that one.\n\nJust so the question is clear: how much is too much for you? If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for? I'm not comfortable saying 'my vote is for double-taps and soft money in government and an institution that can't enforce its will or even keep it's leadership on-message.' So no, the D's can earn my vote as individuals but I'm very skeptical about the institution of their party (likewise Republicans, the Tea Party, The Green Party).

I know it's an absurd question but I'm posing an extreme example to you only to emphasize the point about the shortcomings of approaching voting as realpolitik.\n\nProbably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted]. Pol Pot killed about 25% of his population in 4 years whereas Stalin killed only 10-20% of his population over 30 years. That's a big difference! But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\n&gt;we don't live in a society that separates their moral judgments from their voting judgements.\n\nI disagree.

The scarce few moments it's actually had a chance have had to be shared with several other vitally important issues that were just seeing a glimmer of the light of day. Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\". You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nThe obstruction of Republicans is *far* more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.", "id": "t1_cb7syi2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "johnpseudo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt; Probably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted].

But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\nBy taking this position you've essentially admitted that your position is non-viable (go try to convince Joe America that you're justified in your willingness to vote for either Stalin or Pol Pot.) I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality? Is it not entirely self-evident (from your POV) that voters care about these issues?\n\n&gt;By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\nI've explicitly disclaimed this notion in the CMV post, and in previous responses to you. How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

Just as they were nearing the finish line, Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nYes I was paying attention in '09. Did you notice that Harry Reid had an opportunity to change the Senate rules on filibuster? The Democrats are only locked down in the Senate because they got their priorities mixed up. Harry Reid is *just now* looking at the 'nuclear' option in **2013** (and even then only for judicial appointments, the republicans WILL NOT stop at appointments and Reid knows that he's opening the door for a full blown nuclear option when/if they retake the Senate.) And now they're rolling back implementation even on what they DID get done. These people in the party establishment aren't serious about governing with liberal policies. \n\n&gt;Because that's the way the fucking useless Senate is designed- to allow a determined minority to delay everything practically forever.\n\nNot really. The Senate wasn't designed to require a 60 vote supermajority and you're well aware of that. They had time to pass landmark healthcare, they could have spent that time on filibuster reform and the past 5 years would have gone quite a bit differently (and they would have been able to pass healthcare anyway.) But as an institution they have no spine.\n\n&gt;And of course President Obama didn't have complete freedom to do whatever he wanted. \n\nI'm not saying that he did.\n\n&gt;I could easily imagine someone like Max Baucus or Joe Lieberman throwing up an objection which would have brought the whole thing to an end.\n\nThey spent more time on Bernie Sanders than on 'moderates' like Lieberman from the reportage I was seeing. That makes sense because Sanders is a socialist and as a party the democrats had long supported single-payer (because it actually makes sense in the context of the Democratic party's ideology and philosophical underpinnings) and he was horrified to see a deal that essentially created a new (and captive) market for private insurers. I think they hammered out a particular provision with Baucus but memory escapes me what it was.\n\n&gt;If even a single Democratic Senator was opposed, it wouldn't get through the Senate.\n\nWell who am I to hold accountable for that other than Harry Reid? If Democrats had championed filibuster reform *first* they could still have been *governing* today, but that isn't what they're interested in doing. They can't even police their own party: after gun control flopped at the beginning of this term the major donors pushed for culling the bluedogs from party funding and even THAT was no go. This is the gang who can't shoot straight.\n\n&gt;For all the horrible flaws Lieberman had, it was still useful to have him in office rather than a Republican (he did vote for Obamacare, the stimulus, and many other useful pieces of legislation after all).\n\nIrrelevant. He's an independent, and we're talking about Democrats. Besides, useful legislation? A lot of these guys pretend to be moderates but he himself (and quite a few Democrats) [was drinking the neoconservative kool aid.](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00236)\n\nI agree that voters should look at the affirmative arguments for a given candidate but shouldn't they also look at the negative? I don't think somebody like Reid is worth voting for if he's going to get up and pretend to represent the 'liberal' party and then use that position to reauthorize the neoconservative policies of the Bush administration, all the while crying crocodile tears about the republican obstructionism he chose to subject his party to.\n\n&gt;Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nWere *you* paying attention in 2009? Scott Brown '09 is a showpiece for my point about the role of money in politics. Anybody who was watching the money had a good sense that Brown was going to win that one.\n\nJust so the question is clear: how much is too much for you? If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for? I'm not comfortable saying 'my vote is for double-taps and soft money in government and an institution that can't enforce its will or even keep it's leadership on-message.' So no, the D's can earn my vote as individuals but I'm very skeptical about the institution of their party (likewise Republicans, the Tea Party, The Green Party).

What makes you think of the vote as an endorsement?\n\n&gt;If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for?\n\nThat depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that.

But if polls were to say that 70-80% of the population supports shooting first responders, then abstaining from the vote isn't going to accomplish anything.\n\n&gt;Aren't liberals such as yourself better served by supporting individual candidates and not the party? Especially when the party as an organization isn't liberal at all?\n\nOf course I do focus on individual candidates. I would never donate money to or actively promote a conservative Democrat in another state. Because I have plenty of progressive Democrats around the country to choose from. But I can't choose which district I'm voting in, and I can't afford to fly great distances to volunteer for the best candidate every election.

Your vote counts for one person and can *only be cast once, and only for one person, and only from one person per person per election*. You can only vote *affirmatively* and therefore may not express preference, whereas in instant runoff voting none of the above is true and one MAY express preference by listing their preferences in order. When write-in ballots are permitted I always participate on the basis of the above rationale and that scenario presenting an exception to the same. Isn't voting clearly a selection?

We're voting, it's decision time. Secret ballots, nobody finds out until afterward. As to the point about polling you're missing the point.

More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

I have some experience with this having worked on campaigns at the strategic planning level.\n\nSay you're a potential Democratic candidate for an House of Representatives race. The very first thing you would do is look at the past election results to see how things are trending over time. If 2 years ago there were two competitive candidates, and the Democratic candidate won less than 30% of the vote, there's basically no chance of your winning this race. You might still want to run if you're in a position to sacrifice yourself for the greater good of the party, but the best candidates aren't going to do that.\n\nIf the last Democrat won 35-40% of the vote, now you're talking about something in the realm of possibility. If the Republican candidate is especially weak, and you are especially strong, you might win. If the last Democrat won 40-45%, and you feel well-positioned, you might take a shot at it even if the district has an incumbent. If the last challenger won 45-49% of the vote, it's a prime pick-up opportunity and you might even run into significant opposition in your own primary.\n\nEverything other than the results of past elections in that district is a second-tier indicator. Candidates might focus more on demographics and presidential election results in the district if there aren't any good comparable past elections (for example if there hasn't been a strong challenger in a long time).

Realpolitik doesn't deliver on issues it delivers on demands, so if the demand is election reform or whatever else then one can be secure in the decision to only vote for a candidate that espouses that view. At best, you're describing an incentive structure where our leaders have an interest in meeting the needs of about roughly half of the people in their district (hardly what one could call 'representative').

The DISCLOSE Act received [almost exclusively Democratic votes](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00240). Citizens United was ruled exclusively with judges nominated by Republican presidents. With more Democratic congressmen, it seems blatantly obvious that you'd be more likely to see campaign finance reform and voters rights reform.\n\n&gt;An obvious place to start when they were governing in three houses would have been to reform the CPD\n\nCPD?

I keep asking: if they were serious about election reform why didn't they have any significant motion on it when they controlled all three houses? I've already stipulated that republicans may be worse on this issue, but that doesn't justify voting democrat down the ballot.\n\nSet everything aside for a moment: there's already significant support for circumventing the need for a federal legislative solution and going to a constitutional convention (e.g. movetoamend.org).

Just as they were nearing the finish line, Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nYes I was paying attention in '09. Did you notice that Harry Reid had an opportunity to change the Senate rules on filibuster? The Democrats are only locked down in the Senate because they got their priorities mixed up. Harry Reid is *just now* looking at the 'nuclear' option in **2013** (and even then only for judicial appointments, the republicans WILL NOT stop at appointments and Reid knows that he's opening the door for a full blown nuclear option when/if they retake the Senate.) And now they're rolling back implementation even on what they DID get done. These people in the party establishment aren't serious about governing with liberal policies. \n\n&gt;Because that's the way the fucking useless Senate is designed- to allow a determined minority to delay everything practically forever.\n\nNot really. The Senate wasn't designed to require a 60 vote supermajority and you're well aware of that. They had time to pass landmark healthcare, they could have spent that time on filibuster reform and the past 5 years would have gone quite a bit differently (and they would have been able to pass healthcare anyway.) But as an institution they have no spine.\n\n&gt;And of course President Obama didn't have complete freedom to do whatever he wanted. \n\nI'm not saying that he did.\n\n&gt;I could easily imagine someone like Max Baucus or Joe Lieberman throwing up an objection which would have brought the whole thing to an end.\n\nThey spent more time on Bernie Sanders than on 'moderates' like Lieberman from the reportage I was seeing. That makes sense because Sanders is a socialist and as a party the democrats had long supported single-payer (because it actually makes sense in the context of the Democratic party's ideology and philosophical underpinnings) and he was horrified to see a deal that essentially created a new (and captive) market for private insurers. I think they hammered out a particular provision with Baucus but memory escapes me what it was.\n\n&gt;If even a single Democratic Senator was opposed, it wouldn't get through the Senate.\n\nWell who am I to hold accountable for that other than Harry Reid? If Democrats had championed filibuster reform *first* they could still have been *governing* today, but that isn't what they're interested in doing. They can't even police their own party: after gun control flopped at the beginning of this term the major donors pushed for culling the bluedogs from party funding and even THAT was no go. This is the gang who can't shoot straight.\n\n&gt;For all the horrible flaws Lieberman had, it was still useful to have him in office rather than a Republican (he did vote for Obamacare, the stimulus, and many other useful pieces of legislation after all).\n\nIrrelevant. He's an independent, and we're talking about Democrats. Besides, useful legislation? A lot of these guys pretend to be moderates but he himself (and quite a few Democrats) [was drinking the neoconservative kool aid.](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00236)\n\nI agree that voters should look at the affirmative arguments for a given candidate but shouldn't they also look at the negative? I don't think somebody like Reid is worth voting for if he's going to get up and pretend to represent the 'liberal' party and then use that position to reauthorize the neoconservative policies of the Bush administration, all the while crying crocodile tears about the republican obstructionism he chose to subject his party to.\n\n&gt;Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nWere *you* paying attention in 2009? Scott Brown '09 is a showpiece for my point about the role of money in politics. Anybody who was watching the money had a good sense that Brown was going to win that one.\n\nJust so the question is clear: how much is too much for you? If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for? I'm not comfortable saying 'my vote is for double-taps and soft money in government and an institution that can't enforce its will or even keep it's leadership on-message.' So no, the D's can earn my vote as individuals but I'm very skeptical about the institution of their party (likewise Republicans, the Tea Party, The Green Party).

What makes you think of the vote as an endorsement?\n\n&gt;If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for?\n\nThat depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that. If polls were to say that only 10-20% of the population supports shooting first responders, and that the issue is very important, I could see how abstaining from voting and focusing on getting a new constitutional convention would make sense. But if polls were to say that 70-80% of the population supports shooting first responders, then abstaining from the vote isn't going to accomplish anything.\n\n&gt;Aren't liberals such as yourself better served by supporting individual candidates and not the party? Especially when the party as an organization isn't liberal at all?\n\nOf course I do focus on individual candidates. I would never donate money to or actively promote a conservative Democrat in another state. Because I have plenty of progressive Democrats around the country to choose from. But I can't choose which district I'm voting in, and I can't afford to fly great distances to volunteer for the best candidate every election.

Your vote counts for one person and can *only be cast once, and only for one person, and only from one person per person per election*. You can only vote *affirmatively* and therefore may not express preference, whereas in instant runoff voting none of the above is true and one MAY express preference by listing their preferences in order. When write-in ballots are permitted I always participate on the basis of the above rationale and that scenario presenting an exception to the same. Isn't voting clearly a selection?

We're voting, it's decision time. Secret ballots, nobody finds out until afterward. As to the point about polling you're missing the point. If voting is a meaningful expression of your political will at all then does it not affix some moral complicity to the voter when the government they put into office acts? If you're telling me that when you vote you do not make a moral affirmation of the candidate that has earned your vote then how do you enforce your will that your government should be a force for good?

More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?'

They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen.

Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

Realpolitik doesn't deliver on issues it delivers on demands, so if the demand is election reform or whatever else then one can be secure in the decision to only vote for a candidate that espouses that view. At best, you're describing an incentive structure where our leaders have an interest in meeting the needs of about roughly half of the people in their district (hardly what one could call 'representative').

Just as they were nearing the finish line, Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nYes I was paying attention in '09. Did you notice that Harry Reid had an opportunity to change the Senate rules on filibuster? The Democrats are only locked down in the Senate because they got their priorities mixed up. Harry Reid is *just now* looking at the 'nuclear' option in **2013** (and even then only for judicial appointments, the republicans WILL NOT stop at appointments and Reid knows that he's opening the door for a full blown nuclear option when/if they retake the Senate.) And now they're rolling back implementation even on what they DID get done. These people in the party establishment aren't serious about governing with liberal policies. \n\n&gt;Because that's the way the fucking useless Senate is designed- to allow a determined minority to delay everything practically forever.\n\nNot really. The Senate wasn't designed to require a 60 vote supermajority and you're well aware of that. They had time to pass landmark healthcare, they could have spent that time on filibuster reform and the past 5 years would have gone quite a bit differently (and they would have been able to pass healthcare anyway.) But as an institution they have no spine.\n\n&gt;And of course President Obama didn't have complete freedom to do whatever he wanted. \n\nI'm not saying that he did.\n\n&gt;I could easily imagine someone like Max Baucus or Joe Lieberman throwing up an objection which would have brought the whole thing to an end.\n\nThey spent more time on Bernie Sanders than on 'moderates' like Lieberman from the reportage I was seeing. That makes sense because Sanders is a socialist and as a party the democrats had long supported single-payer (because it actually makes sense in the context of the Democratic party's ideology and philosophical underpinnings) and he was horrified to see a deal that essentially created a new (and captive) market for private insurers. I think they hammered out a particular provision with Baucus but memory escapes me what it was.\n\n&gt;If even a single Democratic Senator was opposed, it wouldn't get through the Senate.\n\nWell who am I to hold accountable for that other than Harry Reid? If Democrats had championed filibuster reform *first* they could still have been *governing* today, but that isn't what they're interested in doing. They can't even police their own party: after gun control flopped at the beginning of this term the major donors pushed for culling the bluedogs from party funding and even THAT was no go. This is the gang who can't shoot straight.\n\n&gt;For all the horrible flaws Lieberman had, it was still useful to have him in office rather than a Republican (he did vote for Obamacare, the stimulus, and many other useful pieces of legislation after all).\n\nIrrelevant. He's an independent, and we're talking about Democrats. Besides, useful legislation? A lot of these guys pretend to be moderates but he himself (and quite a few Democrats) [was drinking the neoconservative kool aid.](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00236)\n\nI agree that voters should look at the affirmative arguments for a given candidate but shouldn't they also look at the negative? I don't think somebody like Reid is worth voting for if he's going to get up and pretend to represent the 'liberal' party and then use that position to reauthorize the neoconservative policies of the Bush administration, all the while crying crocodile tears about the republican obstructionism he chose to subject his party to.\n\n&gt;Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nWere *you* paying attention in 2009? Scott Brown '09 is a showpiece for my point about the role of money in politics. Anybody who was watching the money had a good sense that Brown was going to win that one.\n\nJust so the question is clear: how much is too much for you? If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for? I'm not comfortable saying 'my vote is for double-taps and soft money in government and an institution that can't enforce its will or even keep it's leadership on-message.' So no, the D's can earn my vote as individuals but I'm very skeptical about the institution of their party (likewise Republicans, the Tea Party, The Green Party).

What makes you think of the vote as an endorsement?\n\n&gt;If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for?\n\nThat depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that. If polls were to say that only 10-20% of the population supports shooting first responders, and that the issue is very important, I could see how abstaining from voting and focusing on getting a new constitutional convention would make sense. But if polls were to say that 70-80% of the population supports shooting first responders, then abstaining from the vote isn't going to accomplish anything.\n\n&gt;Aren't liberals such as yourself better served by supporting individual candidates and not the party? Especially when the party as an organization isn't liberal at all?\n\nOf course I do focus on individual candidates. I would never donate money to or actively promote a conservative Democrat in another state. Because I have plenty of progressive Democrats around the country to choose from. But I can't choose which district I'm voting in, and I can't afford to fly great distances to volunteer for the best candidate every election.

Your vote counts for one person and can *only be cast once, and only for one person, and only from one person per person per election*. You can only vote *affirmatively* and therefore may not express preference, whereas in instant runoff voting none of the above is true and one MAY express preference by listing their preferences in order. When write-in ballots are permitted I always participate on the basis of the above rationale and that scenario presenting an exception to the same. Isn't voting clearly a selection?

We're voting, it's decision time. Secret ballots, nobody finds out until afterward. As to the point about polling you're missing the point.

Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

They consistently bring it up and consistently vote for it! How much more in favor of it could they be?

I have some experience with this having worked on campaigns at the strategic planning level.\n\nSay you're a potential Democratic candidate for an House of Representatives race. The very first thing you would do is look at the past election results to see how things are trending over time. If 2 years ago there were two competitive candidates, and the Democratic candidate won less than 30% of the vote, there's basically no chance of your winning this race. You might still want to run if you're in a position to sacrifice yourself for the greater good of the party, but the best candidates aren't going to do that.\n\nIf the last Democrat won 35-40% of the vote, now you're talking about something in the realm of possibility. If the Republican candidate is especially weak, and you are especially strong, you might win. If the last Democrat won 40-45%, and you feel well-positioned, you might take a shot at it even if the district has an incumbent. If the last challenger won 45-49% of the vote, it's a prime pick-up opportunity and you might even run into significant opposition in your own primary.\n\nEverything other than the results of past elections in that district is a second-tier indicator. Candidates might focus more on demographics and presidential election results in the district if there aren't any good comparable past elections (for example if there hasn't been a strong challenger in a long time).

Realpolitik doesn't deliver on issues it delivers on demands, so if the demand is election reform or whatever else then one can be secure in the decision to only vote for a candidate that espouses that view. At best, you're describing an incentive structure where our leaders have an interest in meeting the needs of about roughly half of the people in their district (hardly what one could call 'representative').

If one can't use their vote to express their demands to the government then isn't the vote irrelevant anyway? That system would be a 'tyranny of the majority'.

Whereas every single Republican Senator voted to filibuster it. So I'm failing to see how the distinctions between individual Democrats in Congress is relevant at all. Republicans are going to filibuster election reform and Democrats aren't.

I have no idea what you're talking about. The 2002 Campaign Finance Reform Act was passed [almost exclusively with Democratic votes](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=107&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00054). The DISCLOSE Act received [almost exclusively Democratic votes](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00240). Citizens United was ruled exclusively with judges nominated by Republican presidents. With more Democratic congressmen, it seems blatantly obvious that you'd be more likely to see campaign finance reform and voters rights reform.\n\n&gt;An obvious place to start when they were governing in three houses would have been to reform the CPD\n\nCPD? I'm unaware of the acronym. But please bear in mind that Democrats had a filibuster-proof majority for only ~3 months in 2009.

I keep asking: if they were serious about election reform why didn't they have any significant motion on it when they controlled all three houses? I've already stipulated that republicans may be worse on this issue, but that doesn't justify voting democrat down the ballot.\n\nSet everything aside for a moment: there's already significant support for circumventing the need for a federal legislative solution and going to a constitutional convention (e.g. movetoamend.org).

Yes, I'm aware that Democrats do bad things. I'm comfortable exercising my right to vote even in situations where I have no clear moral champion, because I understand that politics is never simple or clear.\n\n&gt;There was ample time in that session to pass a landmark healthcare bill so I don't see your point here.\n\nWere you actually paying attention in 2009? They **barely** got anything passed. Mitch McConnell used every single opportunity to delay progress, calling for procedural delays that ate up days and weeks every time something needed to be passed through a committee or brought up for a vote or debated.

And they were getting blasted for not focusing exclusively on the economy, which taking up election reform would have made worse.\n\nAnd of course President Obama didn't have complete freedom to do whatever he wanted. If even a single Democratic Senator was opposed, it wouldn't get through the Senate. I could easily imagine someone like Max Baucus or Joe Lieberman throwing up an objection which would have brought the whole thing to an end. Bear in mind I'm not saying that I would have abstained from an election where it was Joe Lieberman vs. a Republican.

Just as they were nearing the finish line, Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nYes I was paying attention in '09. Did you notice that Harry Reid had an opportunity to change the Senate rules on filibuster? The Democrats are only locked down in the Senate because they got their priorities mixed up. Harry Reid is *just now* looking at the 'nuclear' option in **2013** (and even then only for judicial appointments, the republicans WILL NOT stop at appointments and Reid knows that he's opening the door for a full blown nuclear option when/if they retake the Senate.) And now they're rolling back implementation even on what they DID get done. These people in the party establishment aren't serious about governing with liberal policies. \n\n&gt;Because that's the way the fucking useless Senate is designed- to allow a determined minority to delay everything practically forever.\n\nNot really. The Senate wasn't designed to require a 60 vote supermajority and you're well aware of that. They had time to pass landmark healthcare, they could have spent that time on filibuster reform and the past 5 years would have gone quite a bit differently (and they would have been able to pass healthcare anyway.) But as an institution they have no spine.\n\n&gt;And of course President Obama didn't have complete freedom to do whatever he wanted. \n\nI'm not saying that he did.\n\n&gt;I could easily imagine someone like Max Baucus or Joe Lieberman throwing up an objection which would have brought the whole thing to an end.\n\nThey spent more time on Bernie Sanders than on 'moderates' like Lieberman from the reportage I was seeing. That makes sense because Sanders is a socialist and as a party the democrats had long supported single-payer (because it actually makes sense in the context of the Democratic party's ideology and philosophical underpinnings) and he was horrified to see a deal that essentially created a new (and captive) market for private insurers. I think they hammered out a particular provision with Baucus but memory escapes me what it was.\n\n&gt;If even a single Democratic Senator was opposed, it wouldn't get through the Senate.\n\nWell who am I to hold accountable for that other than Harry Reid? If Democrats had championed filibuster reform *first* they could still have been *governing* today, but that isn't what they're interested in doing. They can't even police their own party: after gun control flopped at the beginning of this term the major donors pushed for culling the bluedogs from party funding and even THAT was no go. This is the gang who can't shoot straight.\n\n&gt;For all the horrible flaws Lieberman had, it was still useful to have him in office rather than a Republican (he did vote for Obamacare, the stimulus, and many other useful pieces of legislation after all).\n\nIrrelevant. He's an independent, and we're talking about Democrats. Besides, useful legislation? A lot of these guys pretend to be moderates but he himself (and quite a few Democrats) [was drinking the neoconservative kool aid.](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00236)\n\nI agree that voters should look at the affirmative arguments for a given candidate but shouldn't they also look at the negative? I don't think somebody like Reid is worth voting for if he's going to get up and pretend to represent the 'liberal' party and then use that position to reauthorize the neoconservative policies of the Bush administration, all the while crying crocodile tears about the republican obstructionism he chose to subject his party to.\n\n&gt;Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nWere *you* paying attention in 2009? Scott Brown '09 is a showpiece for my point about the role of money in politics. Anybody who was watching the money had a good sense that Brown was going to win that one.\n\nJust so the question is clear: how much is too much for you? If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for? I'm not comfortable saying 'my vote is for double-taps and soft money in government and an institution that can't enforce its will or even keep it's leadership on-message.' So no, the D's can earn my vote as individuals but I'm very skeptical about the institution of their party (likewise Republicans, the Tea Party, The Green Party). Aren't liberals such as yourself better served by supporting individual candidates and not the party? Especially when the party as an organization isn't liberal at all?\n\nEdit: Spelling, formatting, grammar", "id": "t1_cb5xmin", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; It is an endorsement, that's the system of voting that we have.

You think a vote is an endorsement, and I see it as simply a way to affect the outcome. Why can't you vote for someone while still acknowledging their problems? What makes you think of the vote as an endorsement?\n\n&gt;If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for?\n\nThat depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that. If polls were to say that only 10-20% of the population supports shooting first responders, and that the issue is very important, I could see how abstaining from voting and focusing on getting a new constitutional convention would make sense. But if polls were to say that 70-80% of the population supports shooting first responders, then abstaining from the vote isn't going to accomplish anything.\n\n&gt;Aren't liberals such as yourself better served by supporting individual candidates and not the party? Especially when the party as an organization isn't liberal at all?\n\nOf course I do focus on individual candidates. I would never donate money to or actively promote a conservative Democrat in another state. Because I have plenty of progressive Democrats around the country to choose from. But I can't choose which district I'm voting in, and I can't afford to fly great distances to volunteer for the best candidate every election.

Your vote counts for one person and can *only be cast once, and only for one person, and only from one person per person per election*. You can only vote *affirmatively* and therefore may not express preference, whereas in instant runoff voting none of the above is true and one MAY express preference by listing their preferences in order. When write-in ballots are permitted I always participate on the basis of the above rationale and that scenario presenting an exception to the same. Isn't voting clearly a selection? As in 'this one gets my vote, I want her!' In order to express the political will consistent with the expression 'I want this one but if I can't have it that way I'll take Nixon instead and then if they both lose I'll take Pol Pot' in the form of a ballot one would necessarily require a runoff style ballot would they not?\n\n&gt;That depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that.\n\nWhat the hell does that mean? We're voting, it's decision time. Secret ballots, nobody finds out until afterward. As to the point about polling you're missing the point. If voting is a meaningful expression of your political will at all then does it not affix some moral complicity to the voter when the government they put into office acts? If you're telling me that when you vote you do not make a moral affirmation of the candidate that has earned your vote then how do you enforce your will that your government should be a force for good? (I don't vote for candidates that I believe will engage in crimes against humanity such as double-taps. This is an extremely low bar.) We don't make moral judgments as a group we make them as individuals.\n\n&gt;I would never donate money to or actively promote a conservative Democrat in another state.\n\nLike I said, D triple C money is still flowing freely to these people.

I know it's an absurd question but I'm posing an extreme example to you only to emphasize the point about the shortcomings of approaching voting as realpolitik.\n\nProbably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted]. Pol Pot killed about 25% of his population in 4 years whereas Stalin killed only 10-20% of his population over 30 years. That's a big difference! But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\n&gt;we don't live in a society that separates their moral judgments from their voting judgements.\n\nI disagree.

The scarce few moments it's actually had a chance have had to be shared with several other vitally important issues that were just seeing a glimmer of the light of day. Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\". You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nThe obstruction of Republicans is *far* more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.", "id": "t1_cb7syi2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "johnpseudo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt; Probably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted].

But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\nBy taking this position you've essentially admitted that your position is non-viable (go try to convince Joe America that you're justified in your willingness to vote for either Stalin or Pol Pot.) I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality? Is it not entirely self-evident (from your POV) that voters care about these issues?\n\n&gt;By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\nI've explicitly disclaimed this notion in the CMV post, and in previous responses to you. How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

Just as they were nearing the finish line, Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nYes I was paying attention in '09. Did you notice that Harry Reid had an opportunity to change the Senate rules on filibuster? The Democrats are only locked down in the Senate because they got their priorities mixed up. Harry Reid is *just now* looking at the 'nuclear' option in **2013** (and even then only for judicial appointments, the republicans WILL NOT stop at appointments and Reid knows that he's opening the door for a full blown nuclear option when/if they retake the Senate.) And now they're rolling back implementation even on what they DID get done. These people in the party establishment aren't serious about governing with liberal policies. \n\n&gt;Because that's the way the fucking useless Senate is designed- to allow a determined minority to delay everything practically forever.\n\nNot really. The Senate wasn't designed to require a 60 vote supermajority and you're well aware of that. They had time to pass landmark healthcare, they could have spent that time on filibuster reform and the past 5 years would have gone quite a bit differently (and they would have been able to pass healthcare anyway.) But as an institution they have no spine.\n\n&gt;And of course President Obama didn't have complete freedom to do whatever he wanted. \n\nI'm not saying that he did.\n\n&gt;I could easily imagine someone like Max Baucus or Joe Lieberman throwing up an objection which would have brought the whole thing to an end.\n\nThey spent more time on Bernie Sanders than on 'moderates' like Lieberman from the reportage I was seeing. That makes sense because Sanders is a socialist and as a party the democrats had long supported single-payer (because it actually makes sense in the context of the Democratic party's ideology and philosophical underpinnings) and he was horrified to see a deal that essentially created a new (and captive) market for private insurers. I think they hammered out a particular provision with Baucus but memory escapes me what it was.\n\n&gt;If even a single Democratic Senator was opposed, it wouldn't get through the Senate.\n\nWell who am I to hold accountable for that other than Harry Reid? If Democrats had championed filibuster reform *first* they could still have been *governing* today, but that isn't what they're interested in doing. They can't even police their own party: after gun control flopped at the beginning of this term the major donors pushed for culling the bluedogs from party funding and even THAT was no go. This is the gang who can't shoot straight.\n\n&gt;For all the horrible flaws Lieberman had, it was still useful to have him in office rather than a Republican (he did vote for Obamacare, the stimulus, and many other useful pieces of legislation after all).\n\nIrrelevant. He's an independent, and we're talking about Democrats. Besides, useful legislation? A lot of these guys pretend to be moderates but he himself (and quite a few Democrats) [was drinking the neoconservative kool aid.](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00236)\n\nI agree that voters should look at the affirmative arguments for a given candidate but shouldn't they also look at the negative? I don't think somebody like Reid is worth voting for if he's going to get up and pretend to represent the 'liberal' party and then use that position to reauthorize the neoconservative policies of the Bush administration, all the while crying crocodile tears about the republican obstructionism he chose to subject his party to.\n\n&gt;Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nWere *you* paying attention in 2009? Scott Brown '09 is a showpiece for my point about the role of money in politics. Anybody who was watching the money had a good sense that Brown was going to win that one.\n\nJust so the question is clear: how much is too much for you? If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for? I'm not comfortable saying 'my vote is for double-taps and soft money in government and an institution that can't enforce its will or even keep it's leadership on-message.'

Your vote counts for one person and can *only be cast once, and only for one person, and only from one person per person per election*. You can only vote *affirmatively* and therefore may not express preference, whereas in instant runoff voting none of the above is true and one MAY express preference by listing their preferences in order. When write-in ballots are permitted I always participate on the basis of the above rationale and that scenario presenting an exception to the same. Isn't voting clearly a selection? As in 'this one gets my vote, I want her!' In order to express the political will consistent with the expression 'I want this one but if I can't have it that way I'll take Nixon instead and then if they both lose I'll take Pol Pot' in the form of a ballot one would necessarily require a runoff style ballot would they not?\n\n&gt;That depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that.\n\nWhat the hell does that mean? We're voting, it's decision time. Secret ballots, nobody finds out until afterward. As to the point about polling you're missing the point. If voting is a meaningful expression of your political will at all then does it not affix some moral complicity to the voter when the government they put into office acts? If you're telling me that when you vote you do not make a moral affirmation of the candidate that has earned your vote then how do you enforce your will that your government should be a force for good?

Trust me, I actively avoid being marked as \"strong reject\". As for invalid ballots, I don't know who you listen to but I've heard democrats talk about election reform most when they make the observation that invalid votes are being cast (and that they know that most of those votes were intended for them.)  The newtime voter id laws are a great example of that. It clearly creates an incentive for them to pursue election reform when I present an invalid ballot.\n\n&gt;On a public basis...\n\nI don't see how any of this passage is pertinent. I'm not walking away from these candidates because they aren't sending me a car to take me to the polling place or spending a dime on me. I'm walking away from their policies. I use all available information to the best of my ability.\n\n&gt;which is what I thought your stance was\n\nIt is my stance but as far as I'm concerned people are crazy for not doing everything they can (including tell blatant lies) in order to get marked down by pollsters as undecided. Anything else is just asking to be ignored and there is absolutely no duty or rational reason to be honest to pollsters (they already consider your statements biased by self-selection.)\n\n&gt;You're confusing...\n\nI'm not confusing anything or talking about how candidates do anything except when you challenge me on that basis (refer to my above point about how invalid ballots are viewed by democrats as 'votes left on the table.') I would rather you answer my fundamental question to you: what is the line that a candidate must cross before you will refuse to vote for them under any circumstance? Do you even have one?\n\nBut we don't have to compare our experiences in politics for me to be skeptical of your point. If candidates don't care about invalid votes, why would they ever move on the issue of election reform anyway? Thats why I cited movetoamend.org: they have a realistic goal that doesn't involve passing a bill through the three houses, and has the potential to enact real election reform.\n\nEdit: sorry about the long delay and poor formating/spelling.

You've got the Democratic party, which actively pushes election reform any time there's a chance it would work. You started out by trying to use the DISCLOSE Act as an example of good legislation that Democrats refused to pass. The actual vote shows that it was actually all Democrats vs. all Republicans. It just seems to me that what we need is more Democrats in power, so that they can either pass it unilaterally or an extended period of political irrelevance will force Republicans to reform their party.

What makes you think it's hard to 'get' that anyway? It's no harder than for a position on some other issue (e.g. pro-choice/life). To say that what I'm doing isn't a viable or effective ignores the enormous influence already garnered by organizers who espouse the usage of this tactic (e.g. the NRA.)\n\nPoint of process: I have made an effort to respond to each of your points in every case, and offered to address any point you feel unsatisfied with in greater depth.

Please respond.\n\nEdit: \n\n&gt;That seems like something a politician would say if they're already fans of election reform.\n\nWhy is that worth commenting on? A great deal of what you've said thus far could easily have been said by a partisan congressional democrat but I don't see the pertinence of either comment.

They're all ineffective uses of the vote.\n\n&gt;what is the line that a candidate must cross before you will refuse to vote for them under any circumstance?\n\nI already answered that:\n\n&gt;That depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that. If polls were to say that only 10-20% of the population supports [crossing that line], and that the issue is very important, I could see how abstaining from voting and focusing on getting a new constitutional convention would make sense. But if polls were to say that 70-80% of the population supports [crossing that line], then abstaining from the vote isn't going to accomplish anything.\n\nSo no, there's no line that, if crossed, would lead me to think that abstaining from the vote would be a good decision. It depends on the degree to which that objectionable policy is accepted by the rest of the country.

I know it's an absurd question but I'm posing an extreme example to you only to emphasize the point about the shortcomings of approaching voting as realpolitik.\n\nProbably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted]. Pol Pot killed about 25% of his population in 4 years whereas Stalin killed only 10-20% of his population over 30 years. That's a big difference! But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\n&gt;we don't live in a society that separates their moral judgments from their voting judgements.\n\nI disagree. People are highly strategic in their voting judgments, and a very high percentage of voters do so despite feeling that they're choosing between the \"lesser of two evils\".\n\n&gt;Of course not (this is a straw man argument, I don't reject the process of voting, on the contrary I want to improve it!)\n\nI mean the voting process *in its current state*.

The scarce few moments it's actually had a chance have had to be shared with several other vitally important issues that were just seeing a glimmer of the light of day. Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\". You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nThe obstruction of Republicans is *far* more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.", "id": "t1_cb7syi2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "johnpseudo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt; Probably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted].

I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality? Is it not entirely self-evident (from your POV) that voters care about these issues?\n\n&gt;By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\nI've explicitly disclaimed this notion in the CMV post, and in previous responses to you. How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

Did you notice that Harry Reid had an opportunity to change the Senate rules on filibuster? The Democrats are only locked down in the Senate because they got their priorities mixed up. Harry Reid is *just now* looking at the 'nuclear' option in **2013** (and even then only for judicial appointments, the republicans WILL NOT stop at appointments and Reid knows that he's opening the door for a full blown nuclear option when/if they retake the Senate.) And now they're rolling back implementation even on what they DID get done. These people in the party establishment aren't serious about governing with liberal policies. \n\n&gt;Because that's the way the fucking useless Senate is designed- to allow a determined minority to delay everything practically forever.\n\nNot really. The Senate wasn't designed to require a 60 vote supermajority and you're well aware of that. They had time to pass landmark healthcare, they could have spent that time on filibuster reform and the past 5 years would have gone quite a bit differently (and they would have been able to pass healthcare anyway.) But as an institution they have no spine.\n\n&gt;And of course President Obama didn't have complete freedom to do whatever he wanted. \n\nI'm not saying that he did.\n\n&gt;I could easily imagine someone like Max Baucus or Joe Lieberman throwing up an objection which would have brought the whole thing to an end.\n\nThey spent more time on Bernie Sanders than on 'moderates' like Lieberman from the reportage I was seeing. That makes sense because Sanders is a socialist and as a party the democrats had long supported single-payer (because it actually makes sense in the context of the Democratic party's ideology and philosophical underpinnings) and he was horrified to see a deal that essentially created a new (and captive) market for private insurers. I think they hammered out a particular provision with Baucus but memory escapes me what it was.\n\n&gt;If even a single Democratic Senator was opposed, it wouldn't get through the Senate.\n\nWell who am I to hold accountable for that other than Harry Reid? If Democrats had championed filibuster reform *first* they could still have been *governing* today, but that isn't what they're interested in doing. They can't even police their own party: after gun control flopped at the beginning of this term the major donors pushed for culling the bluedogs from party funding and even THAT was no go. This is the gang who can't shoot straight.\n\n&gt;For all the horrible flaws Lieberman had, it was still useful to have him in office rather than a Republican (he did vote for Obamacare, the stimulus, and many other useful pieces of legislation after all).\n\nIrrelevant. He's an independent, and we're talking about Democrats. Besides, useful legislation? A lot of these guys pretend to be moderates but he himself (and quite a few Democrats) [was drinking the neoconservative kool aid.](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00236)\n\nI agree that voters should look at the affirmative arguments for a given candidate but shouldn't they also look at the negative? I don't think somebody like Reid is worth voting for if he's going to get up and pretend to represent the 'liberal' party and then use that position to reauthorize the neoconservative policies of the Bush administration, all the while crying crocodile tears about the republican obstructionism he chose to subject his party to.\n\n&gt;Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nWere *you* paying attention in 2009? Scott Brown '09 is a showpiece for my point about the role of money in politics. Anybody who was watching the money had a good sense that Brown was going to win that one.\n\nJust so the question is clear: how much is too much for you? If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for? I'm not comfortable saying 'my vote is for double-taps and soft money in government and an institution that can't enforce its will or even keep it's leadership on-message.' So no, the D's can earn my vote as individuals but I'm very skeptical about the institution of their party (likewise Republicans, the Tea Party, The Green Party).

But if polls were to say that 70-80% of the population supports shooting first responders, then abstaining from the vote isn't going to accomplish anything.\n\n&gt;Aren't liberals such as yourself better served by supporting individual candidates and not the party? Especially when the party as an organization isn't liberal at all?\n\nOf course I do focus on individual candidates. I would never donate money to or actively promote a conservative Democrat in another state. Because I have plenty of progressive Democrats around the country to choose from. But I can't choose which district I'm voting in, and I can't afford to fly great distances to volunteer for the best candidate every election.

Your vote counts for one person and can *only be cast once, and only for one person, and only from one person per person per election*. You can only vote *affirmatively* and therefore may not express preference, whereas in instant runoff voting none of the above is true and one MAY express preference by listing their preferences in order. When write-in ballots are permitted I always participate on the basis of the above rationale and that scenario presenting an exception to the same. Isn't voting clearly a selection?

We're voting, it's decision time. Secret ballots, nobody finds out until afterward. As to the point about polling you're missing the point.

I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

Did you notice that Harry Reid had an opportunity to change the Senate rules on filibuster? The Democrats are only locked down in the Senate because they got their priorities mixed up. Harry Reid is *just now* looking at the 'nuclear' option in **2013** (and even then only for judicial appointments, the republicans WILL NOT stop at appointments and Reid knows that he's opening the door for a full blown nuclear option when/if they retake the Senate.)

These people in the party establishment aren't serious about governing with liberal policies. \n\n&gt;Because that's the way the fucking useless Senate is designed- to allow a determined minority to delay everything practically forever.\n\nNot really. The Senate wasn't designed to require a 60 vote supermajority and you're well aware of that.

That makes sense because Sanders is a socialist and as a party the democrats had long supported single-payer (because it actually makes sense in the context of the Democratic party's ideology and philosophical underpinnings) and he was horrified to see a deal that essentially created a new (and captive) market for private insurers. I think they hammered out a particular provision with Baucus but memory escapes me what it was.\n\n&gt;If even a single Democratic Senator was opposed, it wouldn't get through the Senate.\n\nWell who am I to hold accountable for that other than Harry Reid? If Democrats had championed filibuster reform *first* they could still have been *governing* today, but that isn't what they're interested in doing. They can't even police their own party: after gun control flopped at the beginning of this term the major donors pushed for culling the bluedogs from party funding and even THAT was no go. This is the gang who can't shoot straight.\n\n&gt;For all the horrible flaws Lieberman had, it was still useful to have him in office rather than a Republican (he did vote for Obamacare, the stimulus, and many other useful pieces of legislation after all).\n\nIrrelevant.

I don't think somebody like Reid is worth voting for if he's going to get up and pretend to represent the 'liberal' party and then use that position to reauthorize the neoconservative policies of the Bush administration, all the while crying crocodile tears about the republican obstructionism he chose to subject his party to.\n\n&gt;Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nWere *you* paying attention in 2009? Scott Brown '09 is a showpiece for my point about the role of money in politics. Anybody who was watching the money had a good sense that Brown was going to win that one.\n\nJust so the question is clear: how much is too much for you? If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for? I'm not comfortable saying 'my vote is for double-taps and soft money in government and an institution that can't enforce its will or even keep it's leadership on-message.' So no, the D's can earn my vote as individuals but I'm very skeptical about the institution of their party (likewise Republicans, the Tea Party, The Green Party). Aren't liberals such as yourself better served by supporting individual candidates and not the party?

What makes you think of the vote as an endorsement?\n\n&gt;If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for?\n\nThat depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that. If polls were to say that only 10-20% of the population supports shooting first responders, and that the issue is very important, I could see how abstaining from voting and focusing on getting a new constitutional convention would make sense. But if polls were to say that 70-80% of the population supports shooting first responders, then abstaining from the vote isn't going to accomplish anything.\n\n&gt;Aren't liberals such as yourself better served by supporting individual candidates and not the party?

I would never donate money to or actively promote a conservative Democrat in another state. Because I have plenty of progressive Democrats around the country to choose from.

Your vote counts for one person and can *only be cast once, and only for one person, and only from one person per person per election*. You can only vote *affirmatively* and therefore may not express preference, whereas in instant runoff voting none of the above is true and one MAY express preference by listing their preferences in order. When write-in ballots are permitted I always participate on the basis of the above rationale and that scenario presenting an exception to the same. Isn't voting clearly a selection? As in 'this one gets my vote, I want her!' In order to express the political will consistent with the expression 'I want this one but if I can't have it that way I'll take Nixon instead and then if they both lose I'll take Pol Pot' in the form of a ballot one would necessarily require a runoff style ballot would they not?\n\n&gt;That depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that.\n\nWhat the hell does that mean? We're voting, it's decision time. Secret ballots, nobody finds out until afterward. As to the point about polling you're missing the point. If voting is a meaningful expression of your political will at all then does it not affix some moral complicity to the voter when the government they put into office acts? If you're telling me that when you vote you do not make a moral affirmation of the candidate that has earned your vote then how do you enforce your will that your government should be a force for good? (I don't vote for candidates that I believe will engage in crimes against humanity such as double-taps. This is an extremely low bar.) We don't make moral judgments as a group we make them as individuals.\n\n&gt;I would never donate money to or actively promote a conservative Democrat in another state.\n\nLike I said, D triple C money is still flowing freely to these people.

Trust me, I actively avoid being marked as \"strong reject\". As for invalid ballots, I don't know who you listen to but I've heard democrats talk about election reform most when they make the observation that invalid votes are being cast (and that they know that most of those votes were intended for them.)  The newtime voter id laws are a great example of that. It clearly creates an incentive for them to pursue election reform when I present an invalid ballot.\n\n&gt;On a public basis...\n\nI don't see how any of this passage is pertinent.

I would rather you answer my fundamental question to you: what is the line that a candidate must cross before you will refuse to vote for them under any circumstance? Do you even have one?\n\nBut we don't have to compare our experiences in politics for me to be skeptical of your point. If candidates don't care about invalid votes, why would they ever move on the issue of election reform anyway? Thats why I cited movetoamend.org: they have a realistic goal that doesn't involve passing a bill through the three houses, and has the potential to enact real election reform.\n\nEdit: sorry about the long delay and poor formating/spelling.

I know it's an absurd question but I'm posing an extreme example to you only to emphasize the point about the shortcomings of approaching voting as realpolitik.\n\nProbably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted]. Pol Pot killed about 25% of his population in 4 years whereas Stalin killed only 10-20% of his population over 30 years. That's a big difference! But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\n&gt;we don't live in a society that separates their moral judgments from their voting judgements.\n\nI disagree. People are highly strategic in their voting judgments, and a very high percentage of voters do so despite feeling that they're choosing between the \"lesser of two evils\".\n\n&gt;Of course not (this is a straw man argument, I don't reject the process of voting, on the contrary I want to improve it!)\n\nI mean the voting process *in its current state*.

The scarce few moments it's actually had a chance have had to be shared with several other vitally important issues that were just seeing a glimmer of the light of day. Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".

I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality? Is it not entirely self-evident (from your POV) that voters care about these issues?\n\n&gt;By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\nI've explicitly disclaimed this notion in the CMV post, and in previous responses to you. How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

The auto industry only really started collapsing around 2000, at which point Detroit had already shrunk to half of its peak population. The real root of Detroit's decline was desegregation beginning in the 1950s. As white people moved out of the Detroit city limits and into the suburbs, the jobs went with them. And even though that was primarily just shuffling people around, it was a disaster for the city of Detroit because those people were their tax base.\n\nAnd as that tax base evaporated, the city of Detroit continued to make a lot of bad decisions and risky gambles that never paid off. Because they were short on cash, they relied more and more on long-term commitments (e.g. pensions, retiree healthcare) to attract good city employees. But those commitments continued to become more and more difficult to finance. The situation was already looking desperate before the auto industry began to collapse around 2001 due to the recession and foreign competition.\n\nThen in a series of acts of desperation, the city of Detroit invested hundreds of millions of dollars in \"urban renewal\"- [with the theory that better infrastructure would attract a larger tax base](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-20/big-project-binge-fueled-motor-city-s-meltdown.html).

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I think *how* the tax code is designed is much more important than the absolute level of taxation. The economy-distorting effects of various types of taxes vary wildly.\n\nBut if we're just talking about the income tax, there's actually [very little evidence (PDF)](http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~saez/piketty-saez-stantcheva13thirdelasticity_nber_v3.pdf) of the \"incentive\" effect (or supply-side effect) of lower taxes on high incomes. In fact, there's much stronger evidence of \"rent-seeking\" behavior, where the marginal economic product of top income-earners is much lower than their marginal income. So we should definitely seek the revenue-maximizing tax rate for high incomes.\n\nI think the tax code should also be used to improve the welfare of the very poor. Effectively handing cash to poor people is a much more economically-efficient public policy than doling out specific benefits (e.g. housing/healthcare/job training).\n\nSo I see three goals- helping the poor, maximizing revenue from the rich, and minimizing tax rates on everyone in between. The exact levels will depend on:\n\n* What minimum standard of living we deem appropriate for the poor\n\n* Our measurements of supply-side, tax avoidance, and rent-seeking effects\n\n* What other governmental services we desire\n\nSo if I were to given a chance to change our tax rates (but not the overall design of the system), I would radically increase the top rates and reduce rates on the poor and middle class.", "id": "t1_caznn1y", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "johnpseudo", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1hzajf", "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1430519543, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1hzajf", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_caznn1y", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1373460665", "ups": 4, "distinguished": null}
