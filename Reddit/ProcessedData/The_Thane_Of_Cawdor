We walked into the city hall, filled out a few forms, signed a contract, and went on our way.

Loving v. Virginia has already established the precedence that marriage is a fundamental right. The key for gay marriage is whether LGBT partnerships are considered \"similarly circumstanced\" to heterosexual partnerships. \n\nIf so, then courts would be required to apply strict scrutiny to the law, meaning that it must meet these three tests: (1) the law must be justified by a compelling government interest, (2) the law must be narrowly tailored to fit that interest, (3) the law must be the least restrictive means to achieve that interest.\n\nI don't think that you can find a compelling government interest to ban gay marriage. In fact, most studies are finding that banning gay marriages has a negative social and economic impact. It's not the government's job to enforce morality.

Because we're in Florida, we had to jump through some extra hoops for not going through a Catholic marriage course (don't specifically recall the details) - but I understand that is not common.\n\nMost people that oppose equal marriage rights are coming from a religious viewpoint.

Look at the law around divorce and marital breakdown - everything has to do with property (for the most part). Much like Christmas, the religious undertones in marriage have begun to dissolve to a point where we recognize marriage at *common law*. The point is for the tax benefits and also to give spouses equal rights to relationship property should the marriage dissolve without the need for a formal ceremony or consent on the part of those spouses (basically, if you've co-habitted for two years in a conjugal relationship, you are spouses with respect to family property/custody).\n\nIn my view, when someone says that they oppose gay marriage, they are effectively saying that homosexuals ought to be disallowed from entering into a legal contract with another person on account of their sexual orientation. This is a basic concept of natural law and I disagree with those that would oppose same-sex marriage for this reason.\n\nI've rambled a tad, so to answer your question, I suppose it can be considered a \"valid view\" from a particular standpoint. It's a narrow one, but can get support: namely, we should not be able to force religious institutions to marry same-sex couples. I have no problem if the Catholic church takes this stance - it's their choice. I disagree with it, but it's not my business to tell them how to run their institution.\n\nThat said, Civil Marriage Commissioners hired by the state/government should not be allowed this same discretion. As an agent of the state they are bound not discriminate the same as any other state agent (i.e. the police).

Every argument that the state (federal or local) should make it illegal that I've seen has been terribly flawed an basically leans on a carefully cherry picked, historically inaccurate definition of the word. \n\nOutside of the civil ceremony provided by the state however, do whatever floats your boat. If you're a church, you shouldn't have to marry gay couples if that isn't your belief. Plenty of churches do, plenty don't. And that's fine. Everybody has a right to their bigoted belief system if they have one, -bigotry should just not be encoded in to law.

Marriage has everywhere and always meant one thing - a compact between a man and a woman for the purposes of procreation. Even in cultures that were much, MUCH more tolerant of homosexual behavior than modern America, e.g., Ancient Greece, marriage was only ever thought to be something that could exist between men and women. The notion of marrying another man had all the logic of marrying yourself or your pet dog. There was nowhere a belief that marriage was an expression of love for your partner or anything of the sort. Most of these marriages were arranged, for goodness sake. Indeed in Ancient Rome it was thought fairly strange to be in love with your wife. It was actually something people snickered at. And again, this institution is and has always been about creating the appropriate environment for the rearing of children. Traditionally one of the few acceptable grounds for annulment was infertility.\n\nSo let's rid ourselves of the idea that there is some limitation that has been discriminatately imposed on gays. Gays have never been barred from entering into a marriage proper. What is now being demanded is that we CHANGE the meaning of the word marriage to mean something that it has never meant. Presumably it now means something that two (why only two?) people (why only people?) do to express their love for each other until such time as they no longer love each other at which point they can divorce. Why the state has any role to play in legally recognizing two people's feelings for each other is beyond me, and frankly beyond you.\n\nSo lets examine why it might be a bad idea to change the definition of marriage. (Here I am being generous, since the burden of proof should properly be on those who are seeking a change from the status quo.) Well, one reason might be that a two parent opposite sex household is intrinsically appropriate for rearing children. When you look at any statistics on outcomes for children of divorced parents or children of single mothers, you inevitably come to the conclusion that two parents are better than one. Now, is this good brought about by the fact that the number of parents has increased, or is there something about having both a mother and a father that is necessary for normative development? If the former, we should advocate polygamy, shouldn't we? After all, if two parents are good, three must be better! But if, as I suspect, the good come from having both a mother and a father present, then a \"gay marriage\" is quite possibly a bad arrangement for the rearing of children.\n\nLets examine that possibility. The very, very few studies that have been done on outcomes for children raised in homosexual households suggest that children do even better in these types of arrangements than most children. That's all well and good until you consider that their sample consists almost exclusively of highly stable, highly wealthy, highly educated households and is compared to the national average. These studies are meaningless.\n\nIt might also have a harmful effect on the institution of marriage as a whole. After all, if the meaning of the institution changes so readily under political pressure, does it have any meaning at all? What does it mean to be married, other than to have a document stamped by the government stating something to that effect?\n\nWhat is the justification for denying polygamous couples the right to marry? What about incestuous couples? If marriage is only about expressing love, surely it's appropriate to extend it to these classes of people too. Or are they incapable of love? And with respect to love, once it is gone, are they now divorced de facto, or does the legal recognition of the marriage endure? If it does endure, doesn't this imply that love is not required for marriage, and that it should be open to people of any relationship? Can I marry my best friend? I really like him! Can't children marry each other if they get along, then divorce if they have a fight?\n\nThe fact is that marriage is not about love, but about preparing for the consequences of procreative sex. It is something that men and women enter into because doing so receives social approbation (and not doing so is scorned,) and that social approbation exists because the institution of marriage as it has always been understood is a known social good.\n\nTotally invalid, or slightly more thought out than you were hoping?\n\nEDIT: Folks, no disagreement downvotes.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "well I would say marriages pre-modern era were not as much about love as they are today.

"retrieved_on": 1431562283, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;If we made it legal \n\nIt is legal. Just not recognized by the state. And, of course, as I am arguing, just because it is legal doesn't mean it is possible.\n\n&gt;You hold that marriage is an objective thing that exists in a specific state (heterosexual couple for procreation), I don't...\n\nSay some horrible event happened where all but a small group of people were wiped out. Those people retained their health and were able to hunt &amp; forage for food but had no memory of anything from before the event. No memory of marriage. Eventually they would grow in number and repopulate the planet. Wouldn't it be reasonable to hold that marriage would be the first or one of the first institutions created? By marriage, I mean in any of the variants that fit the definition I've provided, an agreement regulating acts fitting for procreation.\n\nIn most times in history, having a large family increased the strength &amp; wealth of the family and of the society they lived. In a hunter/gatherer society, there was a natural need for an institution to aid in the procreation and raising of children. In agricultural societies, there was a need for an institution to aid in the procreation and raising of children. In modern times, children now have negative economic value but what a child needs still exists. Children need an institution that aids in their being procreated and raised by their progenitors.\n\nMarriage, as I have defined it, is not only a good for the partners and for society, but has the key element of being good for the possible future children. Without future possible children, there would be no need for marriage. People would regulate their relationships without certain formality. Rights, benefits, and obligations would be regulated ad-hoc via spontaneous order.\n\nI recently listened to a podcast from the Aristotelian Society by a Clare Chambers who advocates for both feminists and homosexuals as it relates to marriage but concludes that the state should not recognize any marriage and that, instead, there should be an al-la-carte approach to legal agreements that regulate relationships. I disagree with her on many points but we agree in that there is no reason that the homosexual community cannot achieve regulation of obligations &amp; benefits using an al-la-carte approach.\n\nYou might appreciate opportunity to listen to her programme: http://www.aristoteliansociety.org.uk/the-proceedings/the-programme/clare-chambers/\n\nI'm just not convinced that homosexuals would see any benefit or good in the institution of marriage save for the fact that others have it. If we lived in a world where man and woman did not come together in marriage because we procreated in some other way and children did not require the resources necessary to raise them, there wouldn't be marriage.\n\nI get your point that people created marriage so people can change it. There are two problems I have with this approach:\n\n1. If you change the meaning of something, it is no longer the same thing that you are talking about. What marriage is still exists but what we are discussing is no longer that; it is something else. Therefore, if what exists now regulates acts fitting for procreation, we would simply cease to have a word for describing those relationships. Why not just form a new word to describe what you wish to describe? Wouldn't that be more fair than to hijack a word and leave it's definition now wordless?\n\n2. Marriage pre-existed all other social institutions and therefore no other institutions have the ability to change marriage. It wasn't that marriage achieved a popular vote so it was legislated into existence. And it wasn't that a big mean dictator issued some fiat to create the institution. It was a natural institution that flowed out of man's existence. The nature of man became the source of the institution and therefore only if man's nature changed could marriage change. We might foolishly choose to no longer have a word for it. We might decide to call something else marriage. But what marriage is cannot change so long as we are human beings and not something else.\n\nI just also wanted to add that I really have enjoyed this discussion with you. I don't do it because I feel it is going to change the world but I do think that having this discussion makes both of us better people because we are exploring the fundamentals of what it means to be human. If we don't understand what a human is, we deny ourselves the fullness of being human.

That being said, if there are only a few studies which state this, or there is reason to believe that the studies are biased/flawed, then I can see their personal viewpoint.\n\nI also think a lot of the discussion by either side could boil down to miscommunications. Either a) the right views that being GAY is a choice (as in, they choose to be attracted to the same sex), or b) BEING gay is a choice (instead of attempting to have an opposite sex partnership, they choose to have a same sex partnership. Basically, they act on the urges instead of attempting to 'mesh' with society).\n\nThat being said, it's possible it isn't about homosexuality at all, and it could be the right's view about liberalism in general. I'm just taking a guess here, but if the right viewed liberals as radical hippies who are attempting to get civil rights for whoever they can, and blowing legal issues out of proportion (the blowing out of proportion I can definitely see due to the media on both sides), then they may think the gay marriage argument is just another attempt by liberals to be 'radical' and 'cool' by attempting to gain civil rights for yet another group that they don't agree 'needs' them.\n\nIt could also be that the right is hiding behind religious arguments because they don't know how to phrase their true beliefs without sounding like bigots or homophobic. \n\n\nThat being said, my personal views on politics is that, while I am a liberal and I am for equality, quite a bit of the political bickering seems like it's coming from a country which has grown somewhat restless and bored due to not having anything else to worry about.
