It's really a one way street, with members of congress (who all seem to be rich for some reason) defending the interests of (wealthy) people  who fund their election campaigns. Large government investments for the benefit of big business is a real element of why government is \"big\", but there's also a democratic/political component for that. Since the economic system (capitalism) is a giant free-for-all, which isn't designed to take care of people, it falls on governments to create safety barriers (like environmental regulations, civil rights, workers rights, food stamps, unemployment compensation...) and organize redistribution (free basic education and possibly health insurance etc.) to compensate for the 'dysfunctional', amoral nature of the economic system. Without these latter aspects of big government I guarantee there'd be riots in the streets right now. And, again, unfettered capitalism isn't an answer since nobody seems to know how it could possibly be kept safe from those real world capitalists who aren't necessarily interested in operating in an environment that's brutally competitive.

You're just tripping over the way he phrases the idea. \n\nBasically the eternal problem of capitalism is what to do with the profits. The basic instinct is to use excess wealth to make yet more profits, but in order to do that you need good investment opportunities. What happens when good investment opportunities don't keep pace with excess wealth? Well, either there's a slowdown in the economy (which results in money becoming less valuable) or you start to invest in more risky (or less profitable) ventures. If the second approach is taken then it becomes in the best interest of the investor to dress up the lower quality investment as a more solid enterprise. Everybody starts to believe it because the disguise is somewhat convincing and in a growing market the risks are manageable. As long as the poor investments stay in circulation, the game keeps going and the pile of iffy investments by oblivious individuals and self-deluded (investment) banks keeps growing. Once people, for some reason, start selling their shares in the iffy investments in large numbers, the ones holding the risk realize that a large chunk of their empire is built on shit. The ones who brought the shitty investments/debts to market and got out of the game at the right time make a killing, while the rest of the universe of investors faces the double horror of losing lots of wealth and realizing that a huge market just collapsed which means that what wealth they have left cannot easily be invested anywhere in order to recuperate quickly.

Looking at an envelope is not a search; looking at a message is.\n\nFrom my understanding, the NSA is only collecting and analyzing phone call records, not the actual content. That's more like an envelope. When they think someone is a terrorist, they get a warrant to look at the actual content of the call or email. This is more like a message. Now, of course, the NSA has already recorded and saved the content, because they wouldn't be able to access it after the fact nearly as easily, so it's available for any analyst to see if he wants to (Snowden could access private emails, e.g.).

Also, plenty of coverage existed *long* before Edward Snowden that strongly hinted such programs were occurring. Along with his verification of these programs he's un-intentionally conjured an air of subterfuge, drama, and espionage that has obviously caught the fancy of reddit's primary demographic. The narrative is probably driving a dis-proportionate amount of the interest in this case.\n\nI digress. On the constitutional front, citizens do not determine what is and is not constitutional. That's the whole point of SCOTUS, to be a Socratic \"noble lie\" check on the populace. That being said, I think internet communications are a unique in regards to search and seizure. Basically, for your fourth amendment license to apply you need to have a demonstrable and reasonable expectation of privacy. For instance, you have an expectation of privacy on a public pay phone, as the assumption of both call participants is that the transmission is occurring between only two devices.\n\nBut the internet does not behave like that. Communications over the internet takes place on innumerable number of devices controlled by a plethora of different agents with varying degrees of access to your personal information. And computers by the very virtue of their design and purpose keep meticulous records. I'm not certain anyone not taking very specific steps *should* have even a modicum of an expectation of privacy on the internet. \n\nSCOTUS may hear a PRISM related case, it may not.

If there are more people with the same issues as this, I definitely want them to bring it to light and hopefully make it so that everyone can have a nicer school experience, free of having beliefs shoved down their throats.\n\nI'm hoping a ripple effect of this will be taking it out of elementary schools. One of the things I reflect on from younger years is how they had us do things like this every day. Being young, (below the age of 10) I never had the idea planted in me that it's okay to have your own ideas and that you don't have to listen to everything you hear.\n\nAs I'm coming to the age where I'm considering on having children, I've also had to think about how disgusted I'd be if my child came home filled with notions that may be completely incorrect or just downright ignorant. I shudder to think that my kid will be raised in a world where, if they love the same sex, they will shun and hate THEMSELF because extremist Christian ideals were forced upon them in the school system. As my brother is gay, this is the biggest topic for me. It's slightly unrelated, but it all stems from the same issue. \n\nSorry for venting. It just angers me so much that my brother was afraid to tell me for years that he is gay because it was rooted in him that it's not okay. If my kids have to suffer through that emotional and mental turmoil I will not be okay with it. Whether it's them being gay, not believing in everything our country does, or not wanting to seek comfort in what may be a false god(s), I want the children of today and the children of tomorrow to know that it's okay to have their own beliefs and that nobody should be able to tell them otherwise.\n\nThank you again for your input and reading my post.

In fact, the writ has only been truly suspended during the Civil War, and even there illegally, as Congress, not the President, has to suspend. (It's also been suspended in territories, the Philippines during unrest, and Hawaii during WW2.)\n\nThat said, there was some debate in the Bush years about whether the war on terror counts as an insurrection. The Supreme Court's answer was no. So, what was litigated during the War on Terror cases was whether the habeas guarantee applies in specific circumstances -- wartime detention abroad, off of American soil (Guantanamo), etc. \n\nI cannot recommend enough that, if you're curious about this, you read the *Boumediene* opinion, linked from their [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boumediene_v._Bush) page.

So there was no forced decision between austerity or default like the one Europe is facing. That was a false dilemma created by the GOP for political reasons. \n\nMy point about austerity is simply that the countries that try it find that it depresses their economy.

The family below the poverty line pays that same extra dollar as the billionaire. I don't doubt that would garner widespread GOP support, but it very obviously favors the rich. Each of those dollars means a lot less to them than the family living in poverty.\n\nMaybe I misunderstood you, and you meant a progressive tax increase that still at least touches every income group. So the increase is higher if your income bracket is higher, and lower if it's lower, like our current tax brackets are structured. That's more fair, but if that's what you are suggesting there's no chance it would have gotten any significant Republican support, certainly not enough to pass the House. \n\n&gt;My overarching point is that Obama is not a Keynesian and is just another politician.\n\nI can tell that's your overarching point, and you've very cleverly circled around to it.

Obama has tried to compromise again and again. He's actually offered plans that are nearly identical to ones that the *Republicans themselves proposed* just a year or two earlier, and been shut down. \n\nI'm no Obama worshipper, but he's not the problem here. He's done a halfway decent job of cleaning up a mess he didn't create, despite the GOP trying their best to blame him for it rather than let him fix it.

Obama's $1.295 trillion - 332% of Bush's.  Total deficit would be $221 billion for Bush; $1.226 trillion for Obama.  555% of Bush's.\n\nHeck, lets give Bush 2009 *and* 2009.  It gets a bit closer: On budget of $546 billion to $1.29 trillion.

So this is either unknown or wrong.\n\n&gt; Obama adding the wars back into the budgets when Bush kept them off the books to hide the actual size of his deficit\n\nIn my edit I dealt with this by using the total deficit, on-budget and off-budget.  There are legitimate reasons for keeping something that will not be perpetual off the budget - baseline budgeting.  Obama can claim he \"cut the deficit\" by ending the wars.  But do we expect to be fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan for the next 10 years (as of Jan 2009)?\n\n&gt; When we look at them, we can plainly see the results of his philosophy of deficit spending to stimulate the economy during a recession.\n\n2.5% growth.  Was that due to stimulus or was it just the economy finally starting to grow on its own?  There's really no way to know - you can claim on things, but then others can compare to coming out of other recessions.  It seems this one is an L-shaped recession, given we're not getting \"catch-up\" growth.\n\n&gt;BTW, the reasoning Obama defenders give is that temporary deficit spending during a recession is a good thing to jump start a flailing economy, and the temporary spending is over a roughly 10 year period (I could be mistaken).

Like Rebublicans, he embraced this strategy, and directly after coming into office signed the stimulus like Bush and the Republicans had done a few months previous with theirs. Obama owns that. It is no less an outlier than Bush's policy driven destruction of the surplus.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1crgk9", "selftext": "You're from the UK?  Let me put this in terms you'll understand:\n\nOn the Right hand here we have the congressional Republicans.  They're a group of misogynistic, fear and war-mongering people who are pretty much out to destroy any kind of social program the federal government has.  They stand for less intervention *except* in the cases of marriage equality, and what women can do with their bodies.  This group of assholes (and I mean that... they're such assholes they [filibuster their own bills](http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/12/mcconnell-filibusters-his-own-bill-to-lift-debt-limit.php) ) is a far cry from the average American Republican, who really just likes guns and doesn't like taxes.  Average Republicans are generally down-to-earth people with no larger of a wacko contingent than the left.  Their ideological belief (and I think it's correct) is that governments eventually consolidate power and that that's generally a bad thing if the leadership ever metasticizes into an authoritarian regime.  This was what many believe the civil war was fought over in the 1860's, why our right to carry guns is so important to us, and why they continue to be relevant today.\n\nOn the Left hand we have the congressional Democrates.  Never a less spineless, disorganized group of people have you ever met.  They are liberal, which means they adopt new ideas far faster than the conservatives, who generally adopt new ideas because they are too stupid to realize they've been had (hence why they believe after 40 years that conservative christianity controlling the party is a good thing, or the fact that they're *suddenly* concerned about the massive deficit their president left the country with- a deficit which they now blame on the \"black muslim\" president).  This liberalism puts the democrats in a uniquely vulnerable position to adopt fascist ideals out of being hoodwinked (much like the liberal Germans support of Hitler), another reason to keep the Republicans around.  For all that, Democrats are the ideological antithesis of the Republican idea.  They believe that the government is made up of the people, and being made up of the people, should not shy away from their ability to relieve any suffering the people are encountering.  Hence why our country can't get it's shit together:  each side knows the arguments of the other, and now that the Congressional Republicans have become firmly entrenched and believe they're doing God's will, any compromise is seen as weakness by the Republican Party.\n\nAverage Democrat is basically the same as the average Republican, with the exception that if the two were to encounter a homeless guy begging for change, the Democrat would be more likely to gladly give them some cash and chat for a bit, while the Republican would be more likely to offer them a job and a chance to earn money for themselves (or if they had no means to do so, they would just tell them to \"pick themselves up by their bootstraps\"... because some of them are stupid and don't know where that phrase comes from).\n\nAs for why the congressional Republicans are introducing terrible bills into Congress... it's because they're generally terrible people and nobody's willing to stop them.  The congressional  Democrats are complicit in their actions and are generally just as awful.  The American people are responsible for electing and re-electing these cunts, so we are at fault as well.  We've built a terrible, terrifying government, with sociopaths and [felons](http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/c/congressionalcriminals.htm#.UXMh5bUe2FI) who don't believe that people have a right to trial, as long as we apply the label \"terrorist\" to them.  The world is also at fault for not stepping in and condemning our government's actions, both domestically and abroad.  I don't expect much from the UK, since your government is very similar in where it lies on the political spectrum as ours, but many, many more can and should condemn our government's actions.", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "zfolwick", "id": "t1_c9jbmct", "parent_id": "t3_1crgk9", "score": -5, "retrieved_on": 1431486109, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9jbmct", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366500055", "distinguished": null, "ups": -5}

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1actxz", "selftext": "What a great question.\n\nI don't know where you're from, or how much about american politics you know about, but I'm going to write and hopefully you soak some of it up.  I'm speaking as an American citizen, and not a member of either party, and someone who's read some about American history.\n\nFirst, there are two main political parties: Republicans and Democrats.  They're both pretty self-unaware, but at least Democrats in congress *try* to question their beliefs.  The result of this questioning of their own beliefs is that they tend to embrace new ideas and be more *Progressive*.  This can be great, but it can also be disasterous... like when you first discover internet porn, it's awesome, but then you come across /r/spacedicks and the whole world is terrible- so it is with Progressivism.  You're more likely to adopt whatever comes along promising to solve your problems, and conservatives point to that behavior and see the potential for another Hitler.\n\nCongressional Republicans, on the other hand, refuse to question their beliefs, and are widely regarded as monumentally stupid.  Whereas Democrats in Congress are only regarded as woefully, painfully inept.\n\nNow, that pretty much sums up the political landscape in America.  If you want to understand our fear of government, you have to understand what registered Republicans are thinking when they see our government:\n\nStill reading?  I really hope so.  Because you asked a fucking great question.\n\nFirst, what's in everybody's mind is WW2.  That's a huge tipping point for us.  We learned that *we*- Americans- have the power to *destroy the fucking planet*.  I don't know where you're from, but that's a fucking terrifying and empowering realization.  The fact that a single nation could destroy the planet is scary and should terrify the world.  Also, we reflect a lot on why WW2 happened in the first place- a democratic nation in shitty economic circumstances elected a man who promised to fix everything and restore pride to the electorate.  It just so happened that they elected Adolf Fucking Hitler.  Republicans have been *very careful* to point out the parallels between our economy, and Obama's 2008 election and all the promises he'd made, and the cult status around him.  They are afraid of government because they still remember what happens when people don't have the power to resist.\n\nThe second point to understand the American fear of government, is that it is part of the cultural makeup of our government.  Our founders were a fairly diverse group of Freemasons (who practice democratic principles of governance within their own circles), athiests, christians, philosophers, aristocrats, and inventors.  The many different ideas at the start meant that the only suitable way for the founding colonies to establish a form of government is that no one person should have supreme power.  Our founders created the spirit that inspired phrases like:\n\n\"I love my country, but I fear my government\" -- response against nationalism and government ability to overrun entire populations\n\n\"Any government big enough to give me everything is big enough to take it away\" -- an argument against social services being the purview of the government.\n\n\"He who would sacrifice liberty to acquire a little safety deserves neither\" -- Ben Franklin, Founding Father and general badass.  The Original American Nerd.\n\n\"Give me liberty or give me death\" -- Emphasizing the supreme importance of the sovereignty of the individual over the state.\n\n\"Power corrupt's and absolute power corrupts absolutely\" - An apparently british quote that every child here knows.  (and shame on them if they don't!)\n\n\"The government that governs the least, governs best\" -- Thomas Paine (an excellent person to read)\n\nWe have it drilled into our minds since we were children, instances of institutional corruption from slavery, and Jim Crow laws, to the race riots of the 1960's, the pretty-much-accepted-as-fact that some people in the government had something to do with the Kennedy and Martin Luther King assassinations, the Nixon presidency disaster.  Conservatives have woodrow wilson and FDR (for some reason... I guess because he took everybody's gold or something).\n\nWe are paranoid about our government because it outspends on military matter more than the entire EU and a few other major countries *combined*, and can track every electronic communication *on the planet*.  We're terrified of it because we can see power consolidating over the course of the last 20 years and because we've seen the political and economic landscape deteriorate over the last 40-50 years.  Some of us (like me) are scared because we know that there's no way to reverse it unless our politicians reverse several decisions and turn down a lot of money from donors, which likely won't happen.\n\nI hope that I explained some of the reasons.  There's so much more, and it's such a deep and complex issue.  If you're interested, you should pick up \"A people's history of the United States\" by Howard Zinn.  It's terribly liberally biased (which was the author's stated intent), but an amazing read nonetheless.  Seriously... amazing read.\n\n**TL;DR - Americans don't like the idea of centralized power, because our military is *really fucking powerful* and have been known to do some stupid shit.  Too much power in anybody's hands is a bad thing, and we've been taught that since the beginning of our schooling.  Liberals are just less afraid of it because they see the government as made up of people, the result of liberal governance is greater consolidation of power, while the result of conservative governance is the willingness to use that power to engage in general buffoonery.**", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "zfolwick", "id": "t1_c8wl4jw", "parent_id": "t3_1actxz", "score": 5, "retrieved_on": 1431601895, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1363411252, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8wl4jw", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1363410227", "distinguished": null, "ups": 5}

No one knew what caused the spread of AIDS until the late-1980s, toward the end of his second term. Even in the last years of his presidency, it was not scientifically established that the disease was spread through sexual transmission. Reagan, it should be remembered, was a creature of Hollywood: he knew that it wasn't smart to discuss the issue supportingly, but he came from a culture where it was part of the landscape. He was close friends with Rock Hudson, and was one of the few people who knew of Hudson's homosexuality; it was Hudson's death from AIDS that caused Reagan to finally address the issue publicly. [Reagan's interior decorator in the White House was gay, and Reagan had him and his male partner/lover sleep over at the White House for Nancy's 60th.](http://igfculturewatch.com/2004/06/10/reagan-and-gays-a-reassessment/) Most importantly, as the 1978 California Briggs Initiative sought to ban gay teachers from the classroom, Reagan publicly opposed the initiative, stating that homosexuality is determined at early childhood if not before (even while he sought the White House, knowing it was a nationally unpopular position). \n\nDid Reagan pledge to end *Roe v. Wade*? Yes. But as Governor of California, he signed at least one bill allowing more permissive abortion laws. He never pushed legislation about abortion as President. Most tellingly, when choosing a Justice who he knew would be the determinative vote on overturning *Roe*, he selected O'Connor -- even knowing that she had backed pro-choice legislation as an Arizona legislator, and writing in his diary that she might not vote to end *Roe*. \n\nAs for the GOP \"doing what is has always done since Nixon's time\", I think you should look at Nixon's accomplishments as President. He opened trade with China, not exactly a conservative goal.

Granted, if they were ignored, then any data pertaining to detaining and arresting illegal aliens would be wrong, right?\n\neither of our anecdotal experiences are meaningless in this conversation. if you have other data sets for me to look at, i will be happy to do so, but all available data shows the overwhelming majority of illegal infiltrators into this country are coming from central and south america and are primarily mestizo/amerindian ethnicity. the exact entry method is meaningful only inasmuch as discussing ways to stop it, which we are not.\n\n&gt;why would black people be arrested more than other groups [for drug violations]? \n\nthey tend to do drugs in more public places and be around other activity/people that attract police attention, such as areas with high rates of violent crime. there also exist cultural differences where a white is more likely to immediately comply with police while black culture contains a heavy dose of anti-authoritariansm which leads to behavior when interacting with police that attract even further attention.\n\nthese are **GROSS** generalizations, but they explain much of the gap on victimless drug arrests.\n\nwhat's more useful is to correlate victimization data (for things like assault, robbery, violent rape) with arrest and conviction rates, which show less proportional arrests and convictions for blacks than their proportion of victims would suggest. i would attribute this more towards the 'don't snitch' culture and overwhelmed urban police forces, but i don't have any way to back that up with hard data.\n\n&gt;such margins could not be racism, right?\n\nthey could be if they didn't match victimization data. if say, asians were getting arrested and convicted at higher rates than whites, despite having lower rates of criminality by all measures, then racism would be an acceptable hypothesis to dig into. **there is no logical, fact based argument that higher rates of black incarceration are primarily due to racism specifically against them as opposed to higher rates of criminality.** simply pointing out differences in per capita imprisonment do not constitute an argument for this as i outlined above.\n\n&gt;if a racist legal system targets black people, then they were right because they detain more black people.\n\na logical, fair, and just system will target people who are committing crimes more heavily than those who are not. any argument that there is racism inherent with our justice system or republicans' stance on illegal colonization/immigration needs to first establish that these groups do not commit more crimes or illegally enter first.\n\nsimple disparities are not evidence of any kind of racism or discrimination. is there racism keeping asians from competing in the NFL in proportion to their share of the population? what about racism keeping jews out of the NBA in proportion to their share of the population? \n\nquick aside: there does seem to be a disparity based on the facts i have seen between sentence length when comparing whites and asians to blacks when controlling for crime committed, prior record, etc. my best guess is that this is due to the other groups being more likely to be able to afford decent lawyers than having to rely more on public defendants.

If the GOP were to come up with better Immigration Law that had a more broad stroke, they could totally bank off the largely Christian immigrants.\n\nOkay, maybe I was a bit unfair with my second point, but I'm really giving my opinion as to why I think that more attention is given to Republican gaffs over Democrat ones. I should define Valid vs. Invalid. A Valid argument is one that has some grounding in fact or science. Saying that the Republicans left a mess and seem unwilling to allow Democrats like Joe Biden clean up the mess is actually a valid sentiment, and would require proof to dismiss. Tipping the island of Guam is not founded in any sort of reality, there is already proof that Islands are physically incapable of tipping over, so we do not require proof to dismiss it.\n\nNow, Republicans have been getting have been catching flak recently because of birth control and abortion legislature that, from the start puts women on edge. Naval position doesn't get that much respect or awareness, sadly. The unfortunate thing about drawing attention to yourself in a controversial issue is that there are people out there looking for the slightest mess-up to tear you down.\n\nSo, when you say stuff like, \"Rape babies are god's gift,\" and \"If it's a illegitimate rape the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down\" You will be called out as incompetent.\n\nOh, both sides play the game. It's politics. I love watching it in action, but it's better on reality TV shows rather than on who controls what we we do. I understand that the mentality is currently to \"win\" at politics, I also understand that it is probably impossible to get rid of that mentality. I just feel that it's extremely unhealthy for everyone involved.\n\nAnd, I agree with you on that last point, the Two party system will lead to an overall moderate stance on issues. C. G. P. Grey has excellent video about how that works, and there have been many debates about whether or not this is a good thing. I'm just saying that a unified America is better than 50 different countries, and that there are more solutions that Two Party and completely dissolving the union.\n\nThe biggest question is do we want a Government that caters to everyone's wants or needs? A Representative government will not give everyone everything they want, but, since some people want to kill and steal from me, I'm actually pretty okay with that.

People feel that there is bigotry in the Republican Party because, when the GOP is not wondering why Latinos aren't voting for them, they are pressing bills that do look like attacks aimed at the Latino community, like boarder control. Boarder control being brought up all the time makes even the legal aliens feel like they are unwelcome.\n\nWith the ignorance, again, there are a great many quotes from Republican politicians that just show how out of touch they are. When looking for dumb Republican quotes versus dumb democrat quotes, democrats seem to be using improper phrasing to convey a valid point, where the dumb Republican quotes are just plain wrong. I mean, there's a big difference between Joe Biden comparing the deficit to rape, and Todd Akin's, \u201cIf it\u2019s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways of shutting that whole thing down.\u201d\n\nAnd Obstructionism isn't the real problem with legislature, but the binary ideology that goes into law making. Rather than having a political, or even an adult mentality brought onto the floor, looking for what is best for everyone involved, they treat lawmaking like a game, that you must win. Also, dissolving the union is not the only option to fix this problem, destroying the two-party system for one that more accurately reflects people's beliefs is a much better option, in my opinion.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8fhgwy", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1360897602", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t3_18jgsg", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1431298255, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18jgsg", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8fgl2h", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1360894658", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c8fi52n", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "periphery72271", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_18jgsg", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431298993, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Start local.\n\nGet the right candidates through the primaries, then support them through their elections. Offer challengers even to your own incumbents and force them via primary to validate their actions and policies with your party members by campaigning again for their vote.\n\nCreate caucuses that can go to conventions and network with other Republicans and start a movement within the party. The Tea Party did, albeit with millions of dollars of ideological support from certain parties,  but they showed how it's done. Now do it authentically, for real.\n\nStop letting the conversation in your party be about beating Democrats and make it about being good Republicans again. Remember when you were respected for your own deeds and not for beating Democrats? No? Maybe because it's been that long since a national Republican has actually commanded respect based on what he or she *specifically* was going to do for the country, rather than how they weren't going to be how the last Democrat was.\n\nLet Reagan rest in his grave and start supporting quality candidates that can lead *today*. Show people candidates that look like them, lived some of their lives, at least *seem* to be interested in their honest predicaments without blaming them for their life situations.\n\nDo not depend on theocrats and single-issue voters as much. Realize you have a big, disparate country to govern now, and unlike the past it is all connected by the internet. The 'Southern Strategy' did you fine 40 years ago when the target demographic, older well-off white Christian males and their followers, were the primary source of votes and public opinion. It's not like that anymore, and you can't make it to the finish line on their backs any longer. You have to give people outside that core group a reason to vote for you.\n\nYou also can't win elections by slicing off voters on one issue. No more swinging whole counties based on who wants abortion illegal or not. You can win battles in that arena, but as you might have noticed, in the current political system, you can't win the war. They days of divide and conquer ended when people could actually break out of your manufactured bubbles of propaganda and go out on their own and read differing opinions and an alternate set of facts.\n\nYou have a whole network devoted to espousing your point of view. Use it to tell us, the populace how you're going to lead us, How you're going to take us to a better place than we already are, not spend hour after hour day after day telling us how the other guy is messed up. The Rovian days of slinging enough mud until it sticks is over, there's too many ways to see through the mud, to wipe it away and get a better view. People can see the lies for what they are now, so stop lying so much.\n\nThe current crop of Democrats are winning what they're winning because they can literally step back, shut their mouths and listen to you say things that boggle the mind of the average American. All they have to do to win is get out of your way as you screw up. They don't have to do much other than wait, as your current 'stars' get on national television and say things that can be dismantled with 30 seconds time on Google.\n\nPut better people up there who are better than that. Like I said, if you have to start from scratch and bring them up locally, do it. Frankly, I personally would like to see some smart, moderate, eloquent Republicans, with a set of ideas that actually seem to work for Americans, in the spotlight. \n\nSomeone who wants to govern and lead, not just beat their enemies and win, win, win, while we all lose. Someone who will offer an feasible, rational alternative to Democratic ideas, not just cross their arms and say 'no', or offer such lopsided options that no sane Democrat could support them and sleep at night. \n\nPolitics is ultimately about governing, *not* winning. If your party figures this out and actually puts forward statesmen and women, people who actually want to govern and not battle, you'll find yourself racking up victory after victory, and if the white house and congress is your goal, with a pool of people who actually want to do their jobs and not just win their seats, you'll get that for a good long time.\n\n \n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18jgsg", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8fi52n", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1360899845", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_18jgsg", "selftext": "Not only is it possible, it might be happening already. Since the 1990s, Republican leaders in Congress have refused to bring a bill to the floor unless it can pass with a majority of Republican votes (this is known as the \"Hastert Rule\"). This was never violated from its inception until this year; so far, the Fiscal Cliff and Hurricane Sandy relief have been allowed to come to a vote despite the lack of a majority GOP support. These bills passed due to a coalition of Democratic and moderate Republican support. \n\nIf you look at the breakdown of the Fiscal Cliff vote, it gets very interesting: [Republicans from the more liberal Northeast and West backed it by a wide margin; midwestern Republicans were split; and Southern Republicans voted against it 81-12.](http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2013/01/21/130121taco_talk_packer) It's possible that this could be the dawn of a House controlled by the center-right, rather than the far-right, as the more conservative southern congressmen get increasingly sidelined. \n\nIn addition to the Southern/non-southern split in the GOP, [two other potential crack-ups are happening that could break apart a united Republican front.](http://politicalwire.com/archives/2013/02/14/two_splits_within_the_republican_party.html):\n\nThe first is establishment/anti-establishment. The Tea Party movement certainly helped the GOP take back the House, but it prevented it from retaking the Senate. If the establishment-backed candidates had won their primaries in Delaware and Nevada (2010), or Indiana/Missouri (2012), Republicans would have four more seats in the Senate (and maybe five, since Olympia Snowe probably retired due to increasing radicalism in the party, giving away the seat). The establishment is pushing back against these fringe candidates, and that might change the 2016 landscape enough to increase moderate GOP power.\n\nThe second is Washington/not-Washington. Republicans have more high-profile moderate governors (Christie comes to mind) than they do Senators or Representatives, and many of them represent the potential diversity of the GOP (Bobby Jindal in Louisiana, Brian Sandoval in Nevada, and Susana Martinez in New Mexico). These governors probably represent the best hope of a moderate GOP in the future (as well as having the best electoral chances). If Christie is elected President, don't be surprised if you see social issues (which make the GOP increasingly unpopular with young voters) take a backseat. The problem is that the Republican presidential primaries make it very difficult to be the GOP nominee without taking unpopular stances (think of Romney's immigration positions in the primaries versus the general election).
