My argument is that the CIA has a history of involvement with military coups and political machinations. There is no reason to believe that they have changed. Therefore, I am justified in believing that they are most likely involved in military coups today. The Honduran and Venezuelan coups are two examples. While I can't give proof that the CIA was involved, the indications are sufficient, in my opinion, that the CIA was definitely involved. The CIA would not be a good investment if one could prove they were involved.\n\nIn Honduras, the democratically elected president was basically kidnapped by the military and expelled from the country.  The plane that was used to expel Zelaya was even refueled at a Honduran Military base that also served as a base of operations for US forces and housed 600 American soldiers. The US refused to call it a military coup, meaning the US could continue supporting the new government. So they publicly stated that the former president should return, but did nothing to enforce the actual rule of law. Their negotiations after the fact with the Organization of American States shows that they most likely prolonged the matter to keep Zelaya from returning. In essence, the inaction and blocking the intervention by OAS and the rule of law led to a new regime. Two of the principle leaders of the coup were trained at WHINSEC, a school with a long tradition of graduates who are key players in military coups. So, on the one hand, you could say that the US serendipitously benefited from a windfall during this coup. If you just went on written documentation alone, that is the only thing you could prove. Knowing how the US government and CIA has acted in the past, my conclusion is that they were likely involved at several points in the process of ousting a democratically elected leader.\n\nThe Venezuelan coup is a little more straightforward. The US publicly endorsed the Venezuelan coup, immediately recognizing the new regime. Later it was discovered [that the CIA had knowledge of it](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/03/international/americas/03venezuela.html?_r=0) and [US government officials were involved](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/apr/21/usa.venezuela). So, even though the CIA papers indicate that they would not support the coup beforehand, the fact that the US endorsed it immediately after the fact shows their true intentions. Again, you won't find written proof that the CIA was actually involved in this coup, and written documents actually says otherwise. Every indication, though, is that the US wanted the coup to happen and gave it full support after the fact. \n\nThe CIA is good at hiding their tracks. You are not going to get proof of their involvement until long after the events, or unless their was some whistle blower that leaks the information. They wouldn't have their jobs if everyone could prove their involvement. I am justified for using inductive evidence to believe that the CIA was most likely involved in at least these two military coups even though I can technically prove it.\n", "edited": 1373529459, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cb09fkg", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1373521152", "ups": -1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cazrl7l", "score": 5, "retrieved_on": 1430509926, "controversiality": 0, "body": "You are implying that the rule in this case is that the CIA intervenes in **every** election that may affect US national interest, and therefore anytime a foreign political transition occurs, a person claiming that the CIA is not involved needs to prove that they weren't.\n\nYou're making a false equivalence.

Thus teachers ignore some and fuse others until there are just a few handy labels, and all of morphological patterns get crammed into these simplified categories.\n\nThis may well be pedagogically useful. (I certainly don't mention most grammatical categories to my students.) But that doesn't mean we're talking about different *senses* of a term. It means we're talking about a term and its pedagogical simplification. The simplification is wrong; the only reason anyone uses it is that students are not capable of understanding or using the actually correct concept.\n\nAnalogy: Beginning students of physics learn the Bohr model: atoms are like mini-solar systems, with discrete electrons orbiting a nucleus. This model is false, and has been known to be so for quite some time. Yet teaching the actual, quantum model would likely leave beginners with even less understanding. Thus, teachers teach the simplified truth, and with good reason. *But the Bohr model is nonetheless wrong; its pedagogical usefulness does nothing to mitigate this.*", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cb14ir8", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1373632160", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cb0dm10", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430495287, "controversiality": 0, "body": "To clarify, I meant English grammar vs. linguistic grammar. \n\nAnd yes, I mean the difference between English analysis and English pedagogy.\n\nMy point is that both of you are correct.

Also, much of what you have said is irrelevant to the conversation at hand, which is whether or not the US has good intentions when intervening. However, let's examine each of your claims.\n\nFirst, Africa. Far from being a \"tribal sewer,\" Africa was home to many great empires and civilizations before the interference of Western powers. \nFrom /u/danger0david who posted this answer in an /r/AskHistorians thread\n\n&gt;There were a few precolonial kingdoms in the Sahel that were pretty significant. The Kingdom of Ghana lasted from roughly 750-1076 AD, and although ethnically the kingdom was mostly the Soninke people, to some extent its culture was influenced by the Berbers. Next up is the Kingdom of Mali, which may be the most important of the precolonial kingdoms. It lasted from roughly 1230-1600, though the height of its power was in the 14th and 15th centuries. Comprised mostly of the Mandinka people, the Malian kingdom was larger than much of Europe. It was a commanding trade presence, and cities like Djenne and Timbuktu were hubs for Muslim scholarship.\nThe common factor for all these kingdoms is that they linked the gold trade of West Africa to the salt trade of Arab North Africa, and each was materially prosperous to differing degrees. There's a famous story (which may or may not be apocryphal) about Mansa Musa, ruler of Mali, who went on the Hajj and brought with him so much treasure that he single-handedly caused the value of gold to drop for a few years in Mediterranean Africa.\n\nHowever, European involvement served largely to rob Africa of many natural resources such as gold, diamonds, rubber, palm oil, HUMANS, etc. and Western powers *created* the racial tensions that plague Africa to this day, the most famous example being the Hutsi's and the Tutsi's in Rwanada who were a part of the same tribe before one was delegated as more important than the other in order to help the Western powers keep control, which was then the cause of the Rwandan genocide. The Western powers purposefully shaped a whole continent to be dependent on them and when they all pulled out acted surprised that everything fell to shit.\n\nAs far as the Middle East goes, what about Mesopotamia, the Persian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, the Egyptians and the list goes on. Guess who invented algebra? Guess who is largely responsible for the preservation of many Greek classics by translating them into Arabic? Guess where the cultural hub of the world was while Europe was going through the dark ages, where scientific advances were being made constantly? That's right, this pile of rock and sand and camels we call the Middle East, which was later ravaged by European powers during, before, and after the Cold War. Iran was a beautiful place. US intervention led to the revolution in 1979 which had led to an autocratic theocracy. Afghanistan was a beautiful place. Now, after British invasions, Russian invasions, and now US invasions, it is a war torn country in shambles. The Middle East was one of the most powerful regions in the world and only started declining in the 20th century, but apparently your history lessons did not go that far back.\n\nNow, what is the cause of Islamist violence? In Iraq, where most of this violence takes place, it was started by the removal of Sadaam Hussein, who although brutal was able to keep religious tensions in check. Except, it seems someone went and killed him and now the whole country is in turmoil. I wonder who is to blame. Another point of religious violence is Pakistan. I wonder who has been destabilizing this country for the past ten years by using drone strikes which have been undermining the Pakistani government's sovereignty and creating tensions amng all of the various tribes. Oh right, its the US. Of all the wars in the Middle East of the past 100 years, there is only 1 I can think of where the US was not directly involved, and even then they supplied **chemical weapons** to one side which were then used in the genocide of the Kurds.\n\nThe view point that the \"US didn't set the tables for any of this\" is largely ignorant to world history and shows a complete lack of understanding of the developments that have taken place in the world especially in the last two centuries. I strongly recommend you learn something about the history of these regions before designating them \"sewers\" or \"piles of sand\" because you are coming off as naive to the actual state of the world. The question is, where were the good intentions in any of this? I only see an imperialist nation seizing power where it can", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9hksxu", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366265055", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c9hk5ci", "parent_id": "t1_c9hjxmx", "score": -2, "retrieved_on": 1431516791, "controversiality": 0, "body": "if what you say is true, then why, pray tell, does pretty much every nation in trouble beg the US to intervene?  Why is it that Africa was a tribal sewer before Western involvement (the US wasn't really that big a factor there) and returned promptly to being an tribal sewer after the colonial powers left?  \n\nVietnam?  Vietnam was completely winnable and would have been far better off had the US won.  Why didn't we?  Because of the craven perfidy of LBJ and McNamary, among the two most evil leaders in US history.\n\nThe Middle East?  It was rocks, sand, and camels until the Western powers showed up.   Absent Western involvement it would still be so.   The entire Arab Penninsula produces almost nothing, creates almost nothing, and leaves almost nothing of value behind.  If you take oil out of the Arabic/Persian GDP, the entire region has a GDP the size of a small Scandinavian state like Denmark.  And the ONLY reason they have marketable oil is because of the West.  \n\nAnd then there is the murder and mayhem report.  Since 1948 well under 100,000 people have died in the various Israeli-Islamist conflicts.  That's all in, civilians and combatants.  In that same period of time, over 3 *million* Islamist around the world have killed ... each other.\n\nThe point is that the US didn't set the table for any of this.  It played the geopolitical cards it  was handed.  Sometimes not to well or too smartly but I mainain - mostly - with good intent.\n\nPersonally, I'd love to do the experiment of seeing the US entirely withdraw from the world stage, sell everyone ammo and watch the show.

My argument has been that US global positioning is a product of *pure* self interest, destabilizing countries, invading them, replacing governments, and painting some countries as evil to the international community whenever it serves them to.\n\nAs to whether or not the world owes freedom to the US, I think that is a bold claim. Is Iran better off after the US got involved to \"free\" them? How about Vietnam? Or Africa? Is the current situation in the Middle East not *caused* by the US, or at least a direct response to it?

Many would claim that our presence in the Middle East is merely an elaborate scheme to gain more oil or at least to benefit certain US based oil companies such as Haliburton, [which is lent credence by the fact that oil exports from Iraq sharply increased after the US invasion] (http://www.indexmundi.com/energy.aspx?country=iq&amp;product=oil&amp;graph=production).\n\nThe argument that the US's intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan created a demand for democracy in the Middle East is shaky at best. First because it is yet to be seen the final outcome of the movements, as all 3 countries you listed are still in turmoil and have not been able to elect a stable government which they like. Secondly, many would argue that the impetus for these movements was *not* seeing the US's efforts in neighboring countries (which essentially established puppet regimes which is not what the protest movements seek) but rather a vast improvement in modes of communication which allowed for widespread rebellion in one country, which then became the catalyst for the rest of the Arab Spring.\n\nI would also disagree with your \"Axis of Evil\" argument. The quest for nukes is not necessarily a bad thing, its only a bad thing when it is done by the people that the US doesn't like. The US did not complain about Israel, India, or Pakistan gaining nuclear capabilities, and we did not invade any of these countries when they violated the NPT in order to gain these nuclear weapons, yet the US is staunchly against Iran and North Korea gaining these same capabilities, only because these countries defy US regional interests. The invasion of Iraq was based on a lie, something which no one denies, the only point of contention is whether or not it was known it was a lie before the invasion took place, which from my understanding is unclear. \n\nThe US seems to cherry pick which dictatorships are and are not acceptable based on whether or not they go along with the US, going so far as to overthrow certain governments, often democratically elected, and replace them with dictators or puppet regimes which then represent US interests (for example, Iran, Argentina, Chile, Vietnam etc.) This seems to support the argument that the US does **not** intervene based on spreading democracy or helping the oppressed, but rather to serve its own interests which often ends up involving the need for natural resources, which was reddititis' point", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9hjh54", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366260273", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "There is no evidence that Iran has made the decision to develop nuclear weapons.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1cji9i", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1cji9i", "selftext": "\"Kroenig argues that there is an urgent need to attack Iran's nuclear infrastructure soon, since Tehran could \"produce its first nuclear weapon within six months of deciding to do so.\" Yet that last phrase is crucial.

According to 2010 Senate testimony by James Cartwright, then vice chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, and recent statements by the former heads of Israel's national intelligence and defense intelligence agencies, even if Iran could produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a bomb in six months, it would take it at least a year to produce a testable nuclear device and considerably longer to make a deliverable weapon. And David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security (and the source of Kroenig's six-month estimate), recently told Agence France-Presse that there is a \"low probability\" that the Iranians would actually develop a bomb over the next year even if they had the capability to do so. Because there is no evidence that Iran has built additional covert enrichment plants since the Natanz and Qom sites were outed in 2002 and 2009, respectively, any near-term move by Tehran to produce weapons-grade uranium would have to rely on its declared facilities. The IAEA would thus detect such activity with sufficient time for the international community to mount a forceful response. As a result, the Iranians are unlikely to commit to building nuclear weapons until they can do so much more quickly or out of sight, which could be years off.\" [Source](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137031/colin-h-kahl/not-time-to-attack-iran)", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9iv8a3", "parent_id": "t1_c9iq7sd", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431494177, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9iv8a3", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366425675", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c9iq7sd", "parent_id": "t1_c9ipydv", "score": -1, "retrieved_on": 1431496539, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Fingers in ears?", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9iq7sd", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366409957", "distinguished": null, "ups": -1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9ipydv", "parent_id": "t1_c9hiawu", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431496734, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1cji9i", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9ipydv", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366409201", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c9hiawu", "parent_id": "t1_c9hi4ow", "score": -1, "retrieved_on": 1431517661, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; he US's global presence is due to the need for rare earth minerals, oil, or other natural resources \n\nWell, then the government is doing a crap job, because these things are going up in price, not down.\n\n&gt; However, I'll leave it up to you to decide which explanation you find more convincing. \n\nI am a long time libertarian that was uncomfortable with Bush and cannot stand Obama.

Because all independent research would disagree but there is no profit in that.\n\n\n", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "reddititis", "id": "t1_c913j4b", "parent_id": "t1_c912lyq", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431680055, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1au4vh", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c913j4b", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364067077", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c912lyq", "parent_id": "t1_c912jum", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431679623, "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": 1364064184, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1au4vh", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c912lyq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364063802", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "reddititis", "id": "t1_c912jum", "parent_id": "t1_c911jdg", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431679595, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1364064499, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c912jum", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364063598", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c911jdg", "parent_id": "t1_c90yqud", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431679116, "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1au4vh", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c911jdg", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364059976", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "reddititis", "id": "t1_c90yqud", "parent_id": "t1_c90u5jb", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431677800, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1au4vh", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c90yqud", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364048598", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}
