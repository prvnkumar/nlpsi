My take away on the subjet is that all the places in the world where most people would like to be born and live have the narrowest gab between rich an poor.   That is places like Norway, Germany, Sweeden have narrow gaps, while places with large gaps all belong to developing countries , Sudan, Nigeria, Somalia.  With one exception, the USA Gini is more suitable to developing countries than industrialize countries.\n\nTo clarify my though experiment about where would somebody prefer to be born if given a choice.  Think of it as you're giving one choice; what country do you want be born? but have not control about the family or your soci-economical status in such country. would you prefer Sweden, where you are guarantee excellent education and health service to you and your parents just for being born there or Somalia, where you may be born in a upper class and have everything your heart desires or  brutal poverty, most people would choose the former.\nExcept that Americans had a tendency to think the may give it a go to the later an play the odds, the reason for that is because Americans are being told that the USA have great social mobility, you can be born dirt poor and die richer that Rockeffeler (Notice I didn't use B.

You don't get that sort of mobility without extreme luck, whether in genetics or opportunity.\n\nOh, and why not look at \"socio-economic mobility in the US\" rather than just the generic.  You'll find this:\n\n&gt; A 2007 study \"Economic Mobility Project: Across Generations,\" using Panel Study of Income Dynamics, found 67% of Americans who were children in 1968 had higher levels of real family income in 1995\u20132002 than their parents had in 1967\u20131971[23] (although most of this growth in total family income can be attributed to the increasing number of women who work since male earnings have stayed relatively stable throughout this time[23]) As to whether this figure is higher or lower than other countries is difficult to say as this type of measure has not been done for other countries.[23]\n\nSocial mobility depends on a lot, especially when comparing to other nations.  We're radically diverse compared to Nordic countries.  And I argue that government programs make it harder to move up thanks to various benefit program \"cliffs\" that should instead phase out.\n\nWhatever.  In the end, I'm the one arguing that people can do it, and you're arguing people can't.  And somehow that message wins.

The ability to re-phrase something into something else doesn't speak against the first thing, except in the special cases where it is equal to the other thing.  Specifically, political polarization is not always a concept conjured to justify one side or the other, or condemn one side or the other.  \n\nPolitical polarization is a serious issue; it completely undermines our democracy by asserting from a position of authority that all effective political activity happens in one of two places, either with the Blues or with the Reds.
