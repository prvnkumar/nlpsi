It says that the tax credits rise with the premiums.\n\n\"*The key to a \"death spiral\" is the \"spiral\" part. Once it reaches a certain point, it becomes self-reinforcing -- and almost impossible to stop. Could that really happen to Obamacare? Probably not. Obamacare is protected from an actual death spiral by interlocking fail-safes. Some kick in if not enough healthy people sign up. Others give healthy people reasons to sign up. Others make sure insurers don't raise premiums too fast. But together, they offer substantial protection against an actual death spiral.\"*\n\nObama decided to authorize tax credits that the ACA did not include. When he did this did he put a huge potential liability onto the taxpayers? Can a president authorize a $10 billion liability without Congressional review? May he incur ObamaCare losses that are greater than the reserves?\n\nHe might win in court, (the first ruling is in February in the DC Circuit). Let's say that Obama loses. Approximately 60% of Americans were supposed to get tax credits. If the court ruling goes against Obama then only 30% will (and the other 30% will have to pay back any that they claimed). The IRS says \"*In order to provide coverage options for purchasers in these reluctant states, the ACA requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to create federally facilitated exchanges for states that do not establish their own exchanges. However, the text of the ACA appears to authorize premium tax credits only for individuals purchasing insurance on an exchange established by a state.\"* http://www.harvardlawreview.org/media/pdf/vol126_patient_protection_and_affordable_care_act.pdf\n\nCongress is not likely to finance any more financial loss reserves than what is already there, so *at some point* there has to be a viable pool of people to insure. Let's say that due to federal negligence that the insurance companies lose $10 billion and the fund has $40 million. What then?\n\nYour link says \"*Others make sure insurers don't raise premiums too fast.\"* This seems like a *really bad* idea. If insurance companies cannot make a decent profit then instead of a death spiral they will all refuse to issue any policies **through the exchanges**. Everyone will then be out of the individual mandate and then no one can get any tax credits. Instead of a death spiral there will be total ACA termination. \n\nThe companies will then only sell insurance outside of the exchanges. What am I missing here?

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "It's nonsense. First off there is no standardized units of measurement we can use here (what is one unit of \"left\" or one unit of \"right\"), second who determines where people fall on the chart? Oh sure there are questions, but whoever asks the questions determines the result. \n\nNot to mention that they determine the scale of the chart, which means they can either heighten or lower the difference between political figures, by changing their arbitrary scale. \n\nThen there is the fact that their social scale (the up-down scale) is complete nonsense. It correlates social with structural politics. So basically it says that opposing the rights of minorities is the same thing as being a dictator. Reality is way more complicated, you can in fact be a racist who believes in democracy and the rights of the individual. Like say your right not to serve black people at a restaurant.\n\nOh yeah and for more fun times with scales, Margaret Thatcher was apparently almost as much a dictator as Stalin:\n\nhttp://www.politicalcompass.org/analysis2\n\nThis isn't getting into the fact that a lot of these questions are pretty loaded. For instance:\n\n\"If economic globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations.\"\n\nWhat if you subscribe to the conservative economic theory that a strong business climate leads to a strong economy and therefore is better for everyone? In that case the interests of humanity and corporations are not so dissimilar. They try to get around this in their FAQ by claiming it's about which is more important. Which basically makes this a hilariously leading question (\"No, you aren't allowed to believe their interests are the same. Are you on the side of the corporations or the people?\")\n\n\"No one chooses his or her country of birth, so it's foolish to be proud of it.\"\n\nThis is a leading question almost by definition. You begin by stating a fact that can't be disagreed with and then use it to attempt to get the correspondent to agree to something else.\n\n\"Our race has many superior qualities, compared with other races.\"\n\nRacism is soooo much more complicated than pure supremacist thought. By simplifying it down to this, you essentially ask a pointless question. \n\nThen there are the completely useless questions:\n\n\"The enemy of my enemy is my friend\"\n\nHoly shit does that tell us nothing about anything. Now it might be possible that they are some sort of super elite psychiatrists who can tell a person's politics, from their agreement with abstract statements. But more likely not.\n\nBefore we go any further, I want to acknowledge that the creators of this chart have a FAQ where they admit that their questions aren't balanced. Buuuut that still doesn't excuse them from writing dumb questions designed to get people to react in a specific way. \n\nThese questions also make certain assumptions about how a certain political belief will lead you to a certain political ideology. For example: I'm guessing believing all races are equal moves you down on the authoritarian scale, which doesn't correlate if you believe a strong central government is necessary to protect people from racists (like say invading a high school to desegregate it). Or being a militarist doesn't mean you don't believe in individual freedom, just ask Robert Heinlein.\n\nOn top of all this, politics is a hell of a lot more than ideology. You are allowed to have policy positions that are more than just what falls under your ideology. In fact those positions are probably a lot more useful in figuring out how you are going to vote. Let's return to Obama vs Romney. Oh sure on this ideological scale (which is arbitrary) they are close together, but there are real policy differences between the two. Obama wants to increase spending, Romney wants to cut it, Obama wanted to implement the ACA, Romney did not, Obama is pro-gay marriage, Romney is not. Ect. So saying they are exactly the same...is just not true. \n\nTl;DR: this is an arbitrary scale, run on leading questions, that mistakes politics for ideology. Please just do some research into what different politicians believe and use that to cast your vote.\n\n\nEdit: So I poked around a bit more on this website. Pretty clear that they have a strong political leaning, just read how they describe President Obama (several of their criticisms, notably those connected to campaign finance, are either speculative or just not true). I wouldn't go to them for an impartial judgement of where you fall on the political landscape.\n\nhttp://www.politicalcompass.org/uselection2012\n\n", "id": "t1_cdek9vl", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "anonymousssss", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1qn63i", "id": "t1_cdenqe2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1qn63i", "selftext": "1) No you are missing the point.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1pww0z", "selftext": "In the opinion of those drafting the law, these sort of plans were a danger to the system. That is because they tended to be what are called \"catastrophic\" plans. Plans designed only to kick in at certain cost levels for certain illnesses.\n\nThe problem there is twofold. First, since these plans didn't cover things like routine medical care and preventative medicine, they tended to fail at keeping overall costs down. This is because illnesses that could have been treated cheaply earlier, instead aren't discovered until they have become much worse. This increases financial stress on the whole system, and as a side-effect causes a fair amount of human misery from people who don't get treated in time. It also increases the use of the emergency room, which is very expensive.\n\nThe second problem is that these plans generate a sort of \"race to the bottom\" dynamic. Basically if we allow plans without a minimum amount of coverage to exist, it encourages all plans (particularly those in the lower tier) to drop off parts of their coverage in order to be cheaper. The result is that people will have a harder time finding low end plans that cover basic preventative care. \n\nThis sort of problem also afflicts other parts of the market, because all plans would be able to not cover certain expensive treatments, effectively creating a situation where people who needed those treatments would not be covered. \n\nThe way to solve all these problems, was to require minimum coverage amounts on health care plans.\n\n", "id": "t1_cd7mway", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "anonymousssss", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Plans designed only to kick in at certain cost levels for certain illnesses.\n\nObamaCare \"designed only to kick in at certain cost levels\".

This is designed to take the place of employer contributions, because Congress doesn't give those directly to Members or staff.\n\nI'm sorry, I'm going to be a dick, but this is 100% wrong. \n\nWhen the ACA was being passed, Senator Chuck Grassley put in a provision to require the President, VP, the Congress and all their staff to buy healthcare on the exchanges. It did away with the employer provided healthcare that had been the norm. (So congress and their staff previously got their healthcare just like a private businesses' employees)\n\nGrassley essentially made congress the only organization that was prohibited by law from offering employer provided healthcare to their workers. It was done as a political fuck you to the democrats passing the bill, and was never intended to become law.\n\nAnd then a strange thing happened. The democrats accepted the amendment. They said, if a GOP member wants to poison the bill just to fuck over their own staff, okay, be our guests!\n\nNow the initial interpretation was that this meant there would no longer be any healthcare benefits that congress could offer. The president didn't like that interpretation so he created a legal workaround that said that congress could provide a health subsidy equal to the cost of buying insurance on the exchanges. \n\nSo, 1) This workaround was not part of the bill. \nAnd \n2) the provision in the ACA wasn't designed to take the place of contributions congress doesn't offer. It was designed to do away with the healthcare congress explicitly did offer until the ACA was passed. \n\n\nWhat the Vitter Amendment does it take away the president's power to authorize the work around. It says to staff, not only do you have to buy healthcare on the exchanges, but we're not going to give you any money to do it. \n\nIt's a giant fuck you by republicans on top of a pre-existing giant fuck you. \n\nNow, why would they do this to their own staff? Because they needed to make it look like the shutdown was worth doing, and the conservative press made a field day out of Obama's \"special Obamacare exemption for government workers.\"\n\nYes, you read that right. The republicans who made congress the only employer in the country prohibited from offering private insurance to their employees, those same people were now blaming the president for trying to fix their mistake. \n\nSo that's why the republicans wanted it in the bill.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1omqqo", "selftext": "I'll take a stab at this. Basically when Congress passes a budget they pass it for a set amount of time (I'll skip the super complicated explanation of Congressional appropriations here), after which it expires. If Congress has not agreed to a new budget by the time the old one expires, they typically pass something called a Continuing Resolution or CR, this basically funds the government at existing levels.\n\nWe also have a completely different law called the debt ceiling. This law limits the amount of debt the US can legally have. This debt ceiling must be continually increased, because we spend more money than we take in in taxes (note: this is not necessarily a bad thing). If we don't increase the debt ceiling we can't take in more money and we are at risk of defaulting on the loans we owe and not being able to pay for required services. This could cause an economic catastrophe as US debt is considered the safest investment in the world, so people and governments buy a lot of it. If they no longer felt certain that this debt would be repaid, it would be bad. It would also cause a constitutional crisis, as the 14th amendment specifically states that we are not to default on any loans. \n\nAnyway back to our story. The old budget for the federal government was set to run out on Sept 30th. The GOP controlled House kept passing Continuing Resolutions that either delayed or defunded obamacare. The Democratic Senate kept sending back \"clean\" CRs, because they felt threatening a government shut down was a poor way to try to get policy passed.\n\nThe deadline passed and the federal government no longer had a budget. This meant it went into shut down, where all non-essential employees were furloughed and large parts of agencies stopped working. About 800,000 employees were furloughed in this.\n\nAt the same time the debt ceiling was set to be hit on October 16th. \n\nThe majority of the House Republicans refused to vote for any debt limit increase or budget that did not delay or defund obamacare and the Senate and the President refused to give into their demands, on the grounds that it wasn't reasonable to threaten economic collapse to hurt Obamacare. Finally on October 16th Speaker Boehner gave in and with about 80 republicans joined the House Democrats to pass a more-or-less clean CR and debt ceiling increase.

This is because he has both tremendous power to control what goes to the floor and because members will rarely defect on a procedural vote (although it does happen from time to time)\n\nNow if Moderate Republicans would actually defect to Democrats, they might be able to force a vote to the floor through something called a discharge petition.

They are actually two different things that are only barely related. \n\nBasically we are currently shut down, because Congress has not passed a bill appropriating discretionary spending for the government (assigning money to pay for programs). This is bad, but not catastrophic, because the government continues to operate programs that are either not paid for via yearly appropriation (medicare/medicaide/social security) or are considered \"essential\" such as the military or air traffic control. Provided the shutdown doesn't last much longer we will be ok.\n\nA default would happen if the Congress refuses to raise the amount that the US can barrow to pay its bills, the so-called debt ceiling. That has to happen...by Thursday (although theoretically you can move money around for a little while to avoid a direct default). If we default it means that the US government no longer has the money to pay back its debts and/or pay for required spending.

It was also coupled with a sharp drop in the amount people paid in federal income tax....because people had less income due to the collapse.\n\n These days the deficit (the yearly amount we borrow) is actually shrinking pretty rapidly (although it is expected to start increasing again slowly in 2016 due to rising health care costs from medicare/medicaid). So for the Fiscal year that just ended it will be about $642 Bil, a far cry from previous years $1 trillion + deficits.\n\nSource: http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324216004578483223631771366\n\nNext up Obamacare. Yes, it will cost money. But it will also save money. In fact it's projected help reduce the deficit by about $109 Billion over the next 10 years\n\nSource: http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43471\n\nNext none of those projections take into consideration that we might, y'know, put in place some policy over the next 10-30 years and they can only guess at how much the economy will grow (remember increased economy = increased tax revenue). It's also a little disingenuous to pretend that if we don't deal with a potential problem that is 10-30 years away right now, we will never deal with it. Particularly since we are still suffering from an economic down turn right now, so it isn't exactly time to be cutting things.\n\nNext, yes, Obama and other Democrats have previously made a big deal about the debt and deficit, it's a typical argument made by parties when they are out of power. Often it's forgotten when they are back in power. You didn't hear Republicans getting outraged about the debt when Bush was cutting taxes or launching wars without paying for them (remember Bush actually came into office with a surplus, which he quickly turned into a structural deficit). It's politics.\n\nClosing note: there is a lot strum-nu-drag about the deficit and the debt, and frankly we are nowhere near it being a real problem anytime soon.

The President has to fund those things he is ordered to fund by Congress. This is very important, because control of the budget is Congress's main power. If the President can just end projects on a whim (by not spending the money allotted), the balance of power would be gone. (Note: the sequester cuts were universal and unspecified, so they worked differently.) \n\nEdit: A little more detail. Basically the President has a limited power to not spend all his money, but he can not do so in a way that would frustrate the will of Congress. Furloughing large parts of the Federal Workforce would do just that. This was determined in the Supreme Court case Train vs City of New York.

This question is about the debt ceiling. \n\nTheoretically a default is much worse than a shutdown, because the President is ordered to spend money the country does not have, as opposed to a mere shutdown where he simply is given neither money nor instructions on how to spend it (and which would be backlogged when a budget is passed anyway).

Yet.  It probably won't happen in this government shutdown, but it will eventually if things don't improve, either by getting more revenue (whether from higher taxes or a faster growing economy) or we cut expenses.

The President has to fund those things he is ordered to fund by Congress. This is very important, because control of the budget is Congress's main power. If the President can just end projects on a whim (by not spending the money allotted), the balance of power would be gone. (Note: the sequester cuts were universal and unspecified, so they worked differently.) \n\nEdit: A little more detail. Basically the President has a limited power to not spend all his money, but he can not do so in a way that would frustrate the will of Congress. Furloughing large parts of the Federal Workforce would do just that. This was determined in the Supreme Court case Train vs City of New York. Source: http://law.jrank.org/pages/9356/Presidential-Powers-Power-Impoundment.html\n\nSecond, with respect, I think you are confusing a government shut down (which is what would happen if we don't pass a Continuing Resolution or a budget next week) with a default (which is what would happen if the government doesn't raise the debt ceiling in October) The two are different things, with different results. This question is about the debt ceiling. \n\nTheoretically a default is much worse than a shutdown, because the President is ordered to spend money the country does not have, as opposed to a mere shutdown where he simply is given neither money nor instructions on how to spend it (and which would be backlogged when a budget is passed anyway). No one quite knows how a default would actually work though, because it has never happened before.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I appreciate your enthusiasm, but there are a few issues. The first is that policy isn't as simple as a bill gets written and then voted on. A bill has to go through a complicated process where it spends at least months (usually years in Congress) getting fleshed out and massaged into a form where it can have minimum negative consequences. This includes both working out straight up kinks in the law (does this law consider this situation?) and feasibility issues (how does the law accomplish it's goal?). That is really something that would be practically impossible to address in a direct democracy.\n\nWhich brings me to the next point you raise, about whether or not Congressmen have enough time to properly consider all the bills before them. The answer to this, is that they don't, but it's more complicated than that. Congress makes laws through the Committee process. This is where before a bill goes before either chamber for a vote, it is first carefully examined and amended in committee. This allows Congress to split up bills to specialized groups of lawmakers to consider them. So for instance, the Healthcare Committee gets to review all the healthcare laws, so not everyone in Congress needs to be an expert in healthcare. Each of these committees has expert staff to carefully evaluate the laws before them, and members who sit on a committee, get to work on a law for a while before it passes. It is worth pointing out that the vast majority of bills die in committee, often because there isn't time in a legislative calendar for them to be considered. \n\nSo we end up with a situation, that while it is true, not every member of Congress is extremely knowledgeable on every bill, the Committee process ensures all bills are studied. \n\nAlso everyone in Congress has staff, who work together to study issues that the Congressperson or Senator will vote on. \n\nNow that doesn't mean that things don't sometimes slip through, particularly in a budget bill, but it does mean most things are carefully evaluated before they pass.\n\nBy contrast in a direct democracy, it would be virtually impossible to carefully consider or amend any piece of legislation. It's not like you can vote: \"I appreciate the idea here, but I have some concerns with implementation, why don't we sit down next week and talk about it.\" Instead you'd vote yes or no. \n\nFinally as to your own personal desires, I gotta be honest with you, in a straight up election I imagine NASA would be toast. Sure people say they want to fund it, but that is before they balance it against everything else they are going to want to fund, such as national security, medicare/medicaid, social security, ect. Even during the Moon Program days, NASA was not super popular:\n\nhttp://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2012/05/space_program_s_future_and_landing_on_the_moon_how_nostalgia_for_the_apollo_program_doesn_t_help_.html\n\nProbably what ensures NASA gets as much funding as it does these days, is Representatives from districts where NASA bases are. \n\n", "id": "t1_cbrxyym", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "anonymousssss", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1kr0d3", "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1429758044, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1kr0d3", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cbrxyym", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1377044668", "ups": 4, "distinguished": null}
