Medicare makes up a huge part of total healthcare spending and the CMS has a huge influence on how 98% of hospitals and a significant number of private practices do business. You can't have any discussion about healthcare spending and *not* address Medicare. I understand what you're saying about how it got put in the ACA but no one who works in health care was surprised. Medicare is the only way to start holding providers accountable for heathcare outcomes (which is the last thing they want). It may have looked like a last minute \"here, we'll just add this and make the numbers add up\" but had it been introduced early on, it would have been *destroyed* by the proAMA lobbyists.The part D and advantage stuff is largely smoke and mirrors, what's important is the move towards pay for performance. Medicare is leverage to force the medical community to admit that we need to look in the mirror.\n\nHealthcare is quick to pick up new treatments and diagnostic technology but we are painfully slow when it comes to cultural change. Defensive care has become the status quo and the only thing scarier to a hospital than a malpractice suit is the thought of losing Medicare eligibility so applied correctly, it could be a powerful motivation to initiate improvements. As I before, Medicare patients don't get treated in a vacuum, so improvements in their outcomes tend to lead to improvements in all patients. \n\nSpecifically addressing your point about EHR's... The capital outlay for a private practice to switch to an EHR is high, so even when the benefit to the system is high they may be reluctant to make the leap. The incentives are basically there to help out with the cost in order to speed up the inevitable. Again you make a valid point about past performance but the initial focus was on data collection (which has gone well), the next push is for interoperability. It's a complex process, but we've made great strides in secure transmission protocols of private information. Adaptation of one way transmission to systems  like statewide pharmacy records has been in place for awhile (which I know, raises it's own discussion), now we're working on the ability for outpatient clinics and hospitals to share information. Again, great at accepting new treatments, slow to change the cultural of day to day business. \n\nI get it, I really do. It's terrible legislation. The stink of the lobbyists is high. I'm not trying to say the ACA is the end all be all. But it's the law until it isn't, which could be 12 months from now or 12 years from now so I'm just going to keep trying to make lemons into lemonade. There are opportunities to make some much needed changes if the medical community is ready to step up and think outside the box. It's truly a fascinating time to be in the field of health care. Incredibly frustrating at times, but interesting none the less. \n\nThank you for the thoughtful\n conversation. \n\nEdit: I do agree with you that it changes the political landscape and creates new classes of stakeholders and I understand your frustration with that but \"real\" reform is a misnomer.

I mean if we take the situation in Syria right now and removed all the permanent SC members, those 4 countries alone would be able to probably replicate the type of military action the US is planning on taking.\n\nThe facts are:\n\n1) The permanent SC members were on the \"winning\" side of WW2 (and had large militaries at the time).\n\n2) Other countries with large militaries at the time but were on the 'losing' side of WW2 (Germany, Japan) WEREN'T made permanent SC members.\n\n3) While both the international political landscape and relative military strength of the permanent SC members has changed (e.g. Japan spending more then France on their military) this has had no effect on permanent membership of the SC.\n\n4) All other SC members who are not permanent are not selected based on the size of their military capability. For example some of the current members and their ranking in terms of military spend: Azerbaijan (59th), Argentina (48th), Guatemala (110th), Luxembourg (93rd), Rwanda (124th). So as you can see, military strength is not a pre-cursor to membership of the security council for any other state.\n\nSo the assertion that the permanent members are permanent due to any reason beyond historic reasons doesn't really have any basis. \n\nRelative military strength is not required to either be a permanent member of the security council, no-one has asked France to move aside for Japan nor is there a mechanism to do so. This is further reinforced by the fact that military strength isn't even a requirement to be a non-permanent member of the SC as evidenced by the current membership list. \n\nLikewise the absence of both Germany and Japan, who at the time the UN was formed had sizeable militaries, is a pretty obvious indicator that it was based on the winners of WW2. Especially as the French didn't even have a sizeable army to contribute to the fall of Hitler's Germany by the end of the war. \n\nIf we consider that military strength isn't a precursor to being a permanent SC member, a non-permanent SC member and the fact that both Japan and Germany are absent from the permanent SC member list despite having larger militaries then France at the end of WW2, it's pretty clear it's simply a historical reason.\n\nNow if you wish you can argue that you *need* them to be permanent members as without them any actions are doomed to fail. However, I wasn't taking issue with whether or not they are *needed* as permanent members, simply the explanation as to *why* they are permanent members in the first place as the answer seemed to imply relative military strength had anything to do with it beyond it helped them win WW2.

The main organ of the UN is the General Assembly, and there all nations get one vote and are equal. \n\nYour point is well taken though. The Security Council is the only part of the UN with teeth, and the part responsible for matters of peace and war. \n\nThe Security Council does not have equal representation for a few reasons. At its creation in the wake of WWII, the Security Council was made up of the five countries that were the principal victors: the US, the Soviet Union, China, Britain, and France. \n\nAside from historical reasons, the simple fact of the matter is that the UN has no military power of its own; it does not have its own army with which to enforce things. So when the UN intervenes, it is really the more powerful member states that are intervening. \n\nThere are only a few nations that have the military might to effectively engage in a conflict on the other side of the world; what you might call [great powers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_power), and the most powerful of those sit on the security council. Not coincidentally, the five countries on the council are also the five countries with [the largest military expenditures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures) (actually Japan recently overtook France, but you get the point).  \n\nSay the rules were changes, and these countries lose their veto rights. Votes on war and peace are put to vote in the General Assembly. What happens? \n\nA great power will simply ignore any vote that doesn't go their way, just like President Obama is planning to do in Syria right now. To bring even a defiant lesser power in line requires threats or action from a great power. So even though a resolution may pass, unless it attracts support of a great power, the UN has no way to enforce it. The security council still de facto exists, things just become a lot messier. \n\nTL;DR, Representation isn't equal because the military and economic power of the members is not equal.

It's also the reason you don't see say, Germany there despite it being one of the G8 and one of the most powerful countries in the world. \n\nEssentially, the pure reason for representation is because those 5 \"won\" WW2 and there's no mechanism to change it without them agreeing to change it (which they never will).

As Japan only recently surpassed France in military spending and they are currently separated by less than a billion dollars, I don't think that discrepancy invalidates the overall point. \n\nBut the correlation between military strength and presence on the security council goes more towards OP's other question:\n\n&gt;What would the UN be like if every member country had equal votes? \n\nGiven that the UN has no intrinsic power, it's not as though smaller countries would be able to override the decisions of more powerful ones even if they had equal representation. Power would still reside with the countries with the most military strength, and since those are same countries currently on the security council, not much would change.

I mean if we take the situation in Syria right now and removed all the permanent SC members, those 4 countries alone would be able to probably replicate the type of military action the US is planning on taking.\n\nThe facts are:\n\n1) The permanent SC members were on the \"winning\" side of WW2 (and had large militaries at the time).\n\n2) Other countries with large militaries at the time but were on the 'losing' side of WW2 (Germany, Japan) WEREN'T made permanent SC members.\n\n3) While both the international political landscape and relative military strength of the permanent SC members has changed (e.g. Japan spending more then France on their military) this has had no effect on permanent membership of the SC.\n\n4) All other SC members who are not permanent are not selected based on the size of their military capability. For example some of the current members and their ranking in terms of military spend: Azerbaijan (59th), Argentina (48th), Guatemala (110th), Luxembourg (93rd), Rwanda (124th). So as you can see, military strength is not a pre-cursor to membership of the security council for any other state.\n\nSo the assertion that the permanent members are permanent due to any reason beyond historic reasons doesn't really have any basis. \n\nRelative military strength is not required to either be a permanent member of the security council, no-one has asked France to move aside for Japan nor is there a mechanism to do so. This is further reinforced by the fact that military strength isn't even a requirement to be a non-permanent member of the SC as evidenced by the current membership list. \n\nLikewise the absence of both Germany and Japan, who at the time the UN was formed had sizeable militaries, is a pretty obvious indicator that it was based on the winners of WW2. Especially as the French didn't even have a sizeable army to contribute to the fall of Hitler's Germany by the end of the war. \n\nIf we consider that military strength isn't a precursor to being a permanent SC member, a non-permanent SC member and the fact that both Japan and Germany are absent from the permanent SC member list despite having larger militaries then France at the end of WW2, it's pretty clear it's simply a historical reason.\n\nNow if you wish you can argue that you *need* them to be permanent members as without them any actions are doomed to fail. However, I wasn't taking issue with whether or not they are *needed* as permanent members, simply the explanation as to *why* they are permanent members in the first place as the answer seemed to imply relative military strength had anything to do with it beyond it helped them win WW2.

The family below the poverty line pays that same extra dollar as the billionaire. I don't doubt that would garner widespread GOP support, but it very obviously favors the rich. Each of those dollars means a lot less to them than the family living in poverty.\n\nMaybe I misunderstood you, and you meant a progressive tax increase that still at least touches every income group. So the increase is higher if your income bracket is higher, and lower if it's lower, like our current tax brackets are structured.

Obama has tried to compromise again and again. He's actually offered plans that are nearly identical to ones that the *Republicans themselves proposed* just a year or two earlier, and been shut down. \n\nI'm no Obama worshipper, but he's not the problem here. He's done a halfway decent job of cleaning up a mess he didn't create, despite the GOP trying their best to blame him for it rather than let him fix it.

The primary damage that has been done is that the democrats have energized the GOP and independents to get out and vote in larger numbers in 2014.  Many republican and independent voters who wouldn't have even cared about the midterms otherwise are now going to be headed to the polls in 2014, because of this gun control push.\n\nIt's not just one single factor, it's a combination of factors.  For example, I usually don't vote in midterms, but now that I see an assault on my gun rights, I've been motivated not only to vote, but to vote for the opposite party than I would ordinarily vote for.  On top of that, i've been motivated to help convince others to defend their gun rights and vote in 2014 for the GOP as well, and I have convinced a lot of people to do so who also wouldn't have ordinarily voted in the midterms at all.

Like I said, I wasn't planning on voting in the midterm at all up until these gun control pushes.

Which is ridiculous.\n\nThat's not what I meant, although there is some of that, I agree that effect is small.  The primary damage that has been done is that the democrats have energized the GOP and independents to get out and vote in larger numbers in 2014.  Many republican and independent voters who wouldn't have even cared about the midterms otherwise are now going to be headed to the polls in 2014, because of this gun control push.\n\nIt's not just one single factor, it's a combination of factors.  For example, I usually don't vote in midterms, but now that I see an assault on my gun rights, I've been motivated not only to vote, but to vote for the opposite party than I would ordinarily vote for.  On top of that, i've been motivated to help convince others to defend their gun rights and vote in 2014 for the GOP as well, and I have convinced a lot of people to do so who also wouldn't have ordinarily voted in the midterms at all.  So I am impacting much more than just a single vote.\n\n&gt;These Democrats, who as you say realize this law will make no difference, will vote based on other issues, just as they did before Sandy when no one was talking about gun control. \n\nThey will indeed, but in their standard tiny numbers for a midterm.  Meanwhile, the gun control pushes have motivated the GOP voters, along with some new converts like myself, to vote in higher than normal numbers.\n\nI still maintain that gun control has made an impact, and will do significant damage to the democrats in 2014.\n\n&gt;But it won't be because the Democrats sabotaged themselves with gun control,\n\nThat will be part of the reason, we just seem to disagree on the magnitude of the difference it will make.  You acknowledge that some voters like myself will switch, but you've ignored the impact gun control will have on republican turnout.\n\n&gt;The gun control debate is not going to affect Democratic voter turnout one way or the other. \n\nIt may not seriously impact democratic turnout, the major impact will be on republican turnout.  Like I said, I wasn't planning on voting in the midterm at all up until these gun control pushes.  The people who ordinarily vote in midterms for democrats will probably still do so, but many democratic and republican voters, and independents, will be motivated to vote because of this issue when otherwise they would not have voted at all.\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9461qc", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364498103", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "kamahaoma", "id": "t1_c943ioh", "parent_id": "t1_c942r5l", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431732330, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c943ioh", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364489628", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "LogicalWhiteKnight", "id": "t1_c942r5l", "parent_id": "t1_c93rjrr", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431731954, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't think you understand how midterms work.
