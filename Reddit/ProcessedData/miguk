Of course, their opinions are unfounded, both in terms of research and logic, but it might be worth looking at why they even think of such things regularly. There are multiple motivations for this train of thought but, there are a few that are common:\n\n* Many conspiracists are poorly educated and thus have a poor understanding how international policy works. They see the UN and the EU and assume these are attempts to take over their countries rather than help them improve.\n* Conspiracists have a high tendency to believe more conspiracist beliefs than just the first one that draws them into this ideology, and they snowball from there (the more they believe, the more new ones they accept). This is because they are searching desperately for evidence for what they believe, and since they can't find legit evidence, they simply use other conspiracist beliefs in place of it (which satisfies their want for personal justification, but fails to justify their beliefs on an academically-sound level). Thus, because other conspiracists believe a one world government is a problem, they go along with that train of thought.\n* Many conspiracists are racists. The KKK, neo-nazis, and other hate groups use conspiracism (*Protocols of the Elders of Zion*, Holocaust denial, etc) as a justification for racism. Others are not openly racist, but use conspiracism as a cover for their beliefs. A one world government is likely to not be controlled by them (as they don't control the UN, EU, or any other body they think will bring it about), so they fear that other races will have just as much if not more power than them.\n\nNow this does not necessarily explain why one world government would be bad, but it does explain why it is considered bad by those who most often express a negative opinion of it.", "id": "t1_cd636wn", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "miguk", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Interesting.

This is not correct at all. Have I seen how the average person invests? UH.... YEAH. They take advantage of easy fucking money and credit - which is what caused the housing bubble, and the internet bubble, and the early 90's tech bubble... You're confusing people's rational economic sense with their knowledge of money and banking and credit. Like I've said a lot of times before - barter won't work because of regular supply and demand between products being wrong, and there being no normalization point in between the two goods. Yes, in really tough times someone who is dying of thirst but has eggs will trade with someone who has water but is starving, and it would be efficient, and everyone would be better off. But as things get better economically, things wouldn't be based so much on survival as before. Life would still be survival, but you would worry more about marginal costs to bartering when you're not starving or dying of thirst regularly anymore. Water isn't as valuable to you when you're not dying of thirst, so if everyone is relatively well of with one item, and that item is the currency, suddenly you have a problem. With gold, it is always rare, and has no use that would make people stockpile it more than their real needs for living. On top of that, gold's value stays up to date with the times and the popular products - if people needed water most, water would be worth more gold, but if water was slowly more available, gold would keep its value relative to other items, and just be worth less in terms of water . Gold is a good currency because you don't measure its value intrinsically - you value it by what it buys in other things. With something like water or food, once those things are normalize, money is worth much less, and you have a rough business cycle of surplus booms and busts, as money (food, water etc..) is more, and then less valuable because of the quantity supplied.

That's wrong. You're assuming I'm some 100% austrian libertarian - and if that were the case you could potentially have a point.

You said multiple times what I \"am\" or what I will \"do\" while I have yet to attack you in any such way... we should keep this civil, no? You assume I am a libertarian (which I am vehemently NOT) and then kind of base a lot of your arguments on that.. The fact that you bring up rand shows me that you have some radicalized view of whatever I say, or will say based on an idea of my ideologies you have pre formed in your head. I'm just talking what is reasonable and logical - not what is ideologically right to some camp of people who are comforted by groupthink. \n\n&gt;\"Sex is worthless junk up to a point.\"\n&gt;&gt;\"It provides psychological comfort. Gold doesn't.\"\n\nagain.. that is a super subjective opinion that you're trying to pass off as fact. A lot of people hate sex, or don't like it unless they are emotionally attached to the person. Similarly, a lot of people love material possessions like gold. Those possessions People like and trust gold for its look, feel, history, tradition. It can be used for a lot of things, but is mostly useful as a medium of exchange. \n\nLet me just say that sex is a terrible example of a currency - you are satiated easily, and the second round of sex is severely less valuable than the first. You'd pay 20 dollars, lets say, for a blowjob, but would not pay 20 dollars for another afterwards. The value of sex becomes less the more you are satiated. Throw in masturbation, and that problem gets more complicated. \n&gt;\" fail to find an argument against an opponent, use a strawman fallacy, get called out on it, use an ad hominem fallacy.\"\n\nYeah.. I didn't do this. I outlined multiple times why barter starts to break down the moment the division of labor starts happening - I gave examples. Didn't make up any straw-men. In fact - I'm continously arguing against a strawman you created as I make this whole apocalyptic defense of gold. \n\n\nWe won't be able to continue very well if you keep thinking of me as some preformed political ideology. Just because you have the idea people who buy, hold, or like gold are a certain way, that doesn't make it true.\n\nGold as money is pretty simple supply and demand - and the problems with barter are also pretty simple supply and demand. If you've taken econ courses like you claim, give me a real argument as to why barter would beat out a currency. \n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1guwq8", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_caoanyv", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1371946207", "ups": -1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cao9gzi", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1430717189, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1371943648, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1guwq8", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cao9skb", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1371943030", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}

This is not correct at all. Have I seen how the average person invests? UH.... YEAH. They take advantage of easy fucking money and credit - which is what caused the housing bubble, and the internet bubble, and the early 90's tech bubble... You're confusing people's rational economic sense with their knowledge of money and banking and credit. Like I've said a lot of times before - barter won't work because of regular supply and demand between products being wrong, and there being no normalization point in between the two goods. Yes, in really tough times someone who is dying of thirst but has eggs will trade with someone who has water but is starving, and it would be efficient, and everyone would be better off. But as things get better economically, things wouldn't be based so much on survival as before. Life would still be survival, but you would worry more about marginal costs to bartering when you're not starving or dying of thirst regularly anymore. Water isn't as valuable to you when you're not dying of thirst, so if everyone is relatively well of with one item, and that item is the currency, suddenly you have a problem. With gold, it is always rare, and has no use that would make people stockpile it more than their real needs for living. On top of that, gold's value stays up to date with the times and the popular products - if people needed water most, water would be worth more gold, but if water was slowly more available, gold would keep its value relative to other items, and just be worth less in terms of water . Gold is a good currency because you don't measure its value intrinsically - you value it by what it buys in other things. With something like water or food, once those things are normalize, money is worth much less, and you have a rough business cycle of surplus booms and busts, as money (food, water etc..) is more, and then less valuable because of the quantity supplied.

It is classic supply and demand - and I've laid out a few scenarios, if not in the comment above, then in a few above that.  \n\nAlso, you're saying all gold buyers are a certain type - and that type thinks and acts a certain way. These are the cash4gold types. The types that get tricked into buying gold stocks and bonds as opposed to physical gold. The people that buy from infomercials advertising \"1% over dealer cost\". That is the type of gold buyer you are basing your argument off of - and they are a tiny, insignificant fraction of those who hold gold in the long run. then you say that the \"legitimate gold market doesn't exist in this scenario\" Okay... then your argument is invalid...

I explained why barter doesn't work - everyone has constant changing needs, and in a market that is complex (it would STILL be complex even in the apocalypse) and that market needs a normalized medium of exchange. You seem to think that everyone would continuously stockpile clothes and food and weapons, and nothing else. That isn't economically effecient. And I can hear you now - \"people don't know what is economically efficient!!11!\" and that is true. they don't know right away. But pretty soon, when no one contracts with you or trades with you because all you are doing is stockpiling weapons, or because the only thing you have to trade is food, and the person you're trading with already has food, you figure what is or isn't efficient. I mean, why don't we use barter now? There is SO much deadweight loss. I've said this before already. When I can't trade, and you can't trade, we both lose.

I'm sure you'll follow through.\"\n\nI said what I said because you framed your comment as if I have selective economic knowledge. You siad something along the lines of \"what I think I know\" about economics, or rather, my actual lack of real economic knowledge. \n\nIt's pretty dissapointing that you're saying \"typical _____\" when I have not taken any position... doesn't that show you your preformed biases? You've created some frame about who you think I am that you are filtering all my words through. You even seem to think that you \"know\" libertarians (which, sorry, I'm not.

You're accusing me of being about to use some type of logical fallacy, without realizing the one you are committing by assuming my position and then attacking it. \n\nOverall you're kind of trying to say that I don't understand microeconomics - how things \"really\" work in the \"real\" world when you stop looking at models and price theories and tax incidences. That's wrong. You're assuming I'm some 100% austrian libertarian - and if that were the case you could potentially have a point.

You said multiple times what I \"am\" or what I will \"do\" while I have yet to attack you in any such way... we should keep this civil, no? You assume I am a libertarian (which I am vehemently NOT) and then kind of base a lot of your arguments on that.. The fact that you bring up rand shows me that you have some radicalized view of whatever I say, or will say based on an idea of my ideologies you have pre formed in your head. I'm just talking what is reasonable and logical - not what is ideologically right to some camp of people who are comforted by groupthink. \n\n&gt;\"Sex is worthless junk up to a point.\"\n&gt;&gt;\"It provides psychological comfort. Gold doesn't.\"\n\nagain.. that is a super subjective opinion that you're trying to pass off as fact. A lot of people hate sex, or don't like it unless they are emotionally attached to the person. Similarly, a lot of people love material possessions like gold. Those possessions People like and trust gold for its look, feel, history, tradition. It can be used for a lot of things, but is mostly useful as a medium of exchange. \n\nLet me just say that sex is a terrible example of a currency - you are satiated easily, and the second round of sex is severely less valuable than the first. You'd pay 20 dollars, lets say, for a blowjob, but would not pay 20 dollars for another afterwards. The value of sex becomes less the more you are satiated. Throw in masturbation, and that problem gets more complicated. \n&gt;\" fail to find an argument against an opponent, use a strawman fallacy, get called out on it, use an ad hominem fallacy.\"\n\nYeah.. I didn't do this. I outlined multiple times why barter starts to break down the moment the division of labor starts happening - I gave examples. Didn't make up any straw-men. In fact - I'm continously arguing against a strawman you created as I make this whole apocalyptic defense of gold. \n\n\nWe won't be able to continue very well if you keep thinking of me as some preformed political ideology. Just because you have the idea people who buy, hold, or like gold are a certain way, that doesn't make it true.\n\nGold as money is pretty simple supply and demand - and the problems with barter are also pretty simple supply and demand. If you've taken econ courses like you claim, give me a real argument as to why barter would beat out a currency. \n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1guwq8", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_caoanyv", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1371946207", "ups": -1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cao9gzi", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1430717189, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1371943648, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1guwq8", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cao9skb", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1371943030", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cao8nwc", "score": -2, "retrieved_on": 1430717341, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;\"Barter is going to be the agreed upon economic method whether your theories tell you it's a bad idea or not, as nothing else could be agreed upon by a large society without methods of communication or access to economic education.\"\n\nYou edited your comment after the fact to try and make it seem like my response is going to be invalid no matter what, try to say I don't know about, or read economic theory (don't make assumptions) and then say *that*?

This is not correct at all. Have I seen how the average person invests? UH.... YEAH. They take advantage of easy fucking money and credit - which is what caused the housing bubble, and the internet bubble, and the early 90's tech bubble... You're confusing people's rational economic sense with their knowledge of money and banking and credit. Like I've said a lot of times before - barter won't work because of regular supply and demand between products being wrong, and there being no normalization point in between the two goods. Yes, in really tough times someone who is dying of thirst but has eggs will trade with someone who has water but is starving, and it would be efficient, and everyone would be better off. But as things get better economically, things wouldn't be based so much on survival as before. Life would still be survival, but you would worry more about marginal costs to bartering when you're not starving or dying of thirst regularly anymore. Water isn't as valuable to you when you're not dying of thirst, so if everyone is relatively well of with one item, and that item is the currency, suddenly you have a problem. With gold, it is always rare, and has no use that would make people stockpile it more than their real needs for living. On top of that, gold's value stays up to date with the times and the popular products - if people needed water most, water would be worth more gold, but if water was slowly more available, gold would keep its value relative to other items, and just be worth less in terms of water . Gold is a good currency because you don't measure its value intrinsically - you value it by what it buys in other things. With something like water or food, once those things are normalize, money is worth much less, and you have a rough business cycle of surplus booms and busts, as money (food, water etc..) is more, and then less valuable because of the quantity supplied.

These are the cash4gold types. The types that get tricked into buying gold stocks and bonds as opposed to physical gold. The people that buy from infomercials advertising \"1% over dealer cost\". That is the type of gold buyer you are basing your argument off of - and they are a tiny, insignificant fraction of those who hold gold in the long run. then you say that the \"legitimate gold market doesn't exist in this scenario\" Okay... then your argument is invalid...

I explained why barter doesn't work - everyone has constant changing needs, and in a market that is complex (it would STILL be complex even in the apocalypse) and that market needs a normalized medium of exchange. You seem to think that everyone would continuously stockpile clothes and food and weapons, and nothing else. That isn't economically effecient. And I can hear you now - \"people don't know what is economically efficient!!11!\" and that is true. they don't know right away. But pretty soon, when no one contracts with you or trades with you because all you are doing is stockpiling weapons, or because the only thing you have to trade is food, and the person you're trading with already has food, you figure what is or isn't efficient. I mean, why don't we use barter now? There is SO much deadweight loss. I've said this before already. When I can't trade, and you can't trade, we both lose.

(Meanwhile, you assume I don't know that barter doesn't work in the long run.)\n\n&gt;Your argument is that 1) I don't know about economics \n\nNo. It's not all about you. Cut the Randian selfishness for a moment and focus on the topic.\n\n&gt;2) No matter what I do know about economics, or what simple supply and demand economics says, barter will now take over, it for some reason it will totally work on a large scale\n\nNo, you're knowledge doesn't matter because you are not the hive mind of the human race, bestowing economic info onto our hypothetical post-apocalyptic survivors. They will continue to be statistically under-educated about economics as they now are.\n\n&gt;3) Because people can't communicate with each other hugely, gold or other money won't be used \n\nAgreements will not be made without communication. One group may use pure barter; another, leftover cash; another, sex; another gold; another, something we haven't thought of. It's hard to get people who have the luxury of modern communication to agree on major political issues; it'd be even harder to get them to agree when they don't have modern communication to handle economics across large areas of land such as states, countries, continents, and the planet.\n\n&gt;You make it seem like you don't know about economics, or even economic history.\n\nTypical Libertarian argumentative strategy: fail to find an argument against an opponent, use a strawman fallacy, get called out on it, use an ad hominem fallacy. You're getting called out on that last one now; if I remember correctly, the next two moves in the Libertarian handbook are to throw a temper tantrum and rage-quit. (And make as many more fallacies as possible in between.) I'm sure you'll follow through.\n\n&gt;even in grade school they teach you\n\nIs that where you get your economics from?

Gold doesn't.\n\n&gt;Sex is worthless junk up to a point. \n\nIt provides psychological comfort. Gold doesn't.\n\n&gt;Gold is worth what its worth\n\nThat pretty much sums up everything you've said.

In other words, I was saying you'll pull another strawman fallacy because you aren't willing to address the argument. Doesn't matter what your education is; if you dodge the question and go for a strawman, you haven't even made a legit argument yet. And now you're using a strawman to cover up your strawman by making these accusations.\n\n&gt;you're saying \"typical _____\" when I have not taken any position\n\nYou're making the same fallacious argument your side makes over and over again.

They are the ones who say we need a gold standard. They are the ones who support that argument with nothing but fallacies and ideological faith. You don't have to tell me you're one of them; it's quite obvious by your opinions and rhetorical approach. And it's not an attack; I was pointing out what you guys do over and over again in the hopes that you'll feel the need to not do that. Seems like even reverse psychology and ideological shaming didn't work to get you to go back to the topic of discussion.

Shall we get back to the post-apoc barter world?\n\n&gt;that is a super subjective opinion\n\nReally? I didn't say everyone's into it, or any other details. I just said that it has that value, as most people would agree. Not everyone likes potatoes, but you didn't argue with that one. I'm sure you understand that \"sex sells\" isn't a marketing motto because it works with a small niche. A small segment of society rejecting it won't grind the economy to a halt.\n\n&gt;a lot of people love material possessions like gold. \n\nGold isn't more valuable than sex even in our current economy. Not that many people have a gold drive pushing them to get it. And if everything goes to pot, gold will be a minor concern at most.\n\n&gt;People like and trust gold for its look, feel, history, tradition.\n\nWow, that sounds like a copy &amp; paste from Goldline, fallacies and all. Starving post-apoc people aren't buying it, though.\n\n&gt;You'd pay 20 dollars, lets say, for a blowjob, but would not pay 20 dollars for another afterwards.\n\n40 dollars for 2 BJs!? The market value for one is twice that (at the lowest); why wouldn't someone go for that deal?\n\n&gt;Throw in masturbation\n\nYou're practically trying to argue prostitution doesn't exist on the grand scale it already does on. Not to mention you assume jerking off has the same value as sex, especially when the person in question is suffering from depression (safe to assume in a ruined world).\n\n&gt;I outlined multiple times why barter starts to break down the moment the division of labor starts happening\n\nThat's your strawman. The issue was never about the value of barter; it is about the value of gold during barter.\n\n&gt; a strawman you created\n\nNope, gold hoarders made it. I'm just giving a counter-argument to it. That's not a strawman.\n\n&gt;We won't be able to continue very well if you keep thinking of me as some preformed political ideology\n\nPlease get back on topic then.\n\n&gt;give me a real argument as to why barter would beat out a currency. \n\nIt won't.

The Federal Reserve conspiracist belief tagged along with them, whether these people were conscious of its anti-Semitic origins or not.

You ever heard of \"embrace, extend, extinguish\"? Microsoft isn't the only one who does that.\n\nChristianity was cooptated decades after the Republicans created the [Southern strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy). After vilifying the Democrats by associating them with black people, they later noticed that there was a sizable portion of those who fell for it that were fundamentalist Christians. By the 1980s, they started a new variant of the Southern strategy: associate the Democrats with anti-Christian views. This was easy to do with the fundamentalists, as they already often had racist leaders. (For instance, Jerry Falwell originally included opposition to Civil Rights in his sermons.) With the highly religious Ronald Reagan as president and de facto leader of the party, this became even easier to do.\n\nOf course, Christianity is not compatible with Republican ideology. They are a business ideology first and foremost, and thus they have to bend the beliefs of Christianity to fit in with it. \"Turn the other cheek\" becomes \"turn the other fist\" for the sake of war, the death penalty, jails, and violent police action. \"Give to the poor\" becomes \"don't let 'those people' take what's yours\". \"Heal the sick\" becomes \"they deserve to die\". Additional beliefs (homophobia, anti-women's rights, racism, etc) get tacked on just for the sake of getting everyone who isn't rich to fight with each other so they won't oppose the Party's interests. What you end up with is essentially anti-Christian.\n\nThey succeed because they try to trick less educated Christians into believing that the Bible says things that it doesn't. This actually works well, as many Republican supporters do not bother to double check and get most (if not all) their newsmedia from Republican-friendly sources (Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, etc.). Thus, the ignorant followers end up becoming [useful idiots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot) for the purpose of propaganda and help to further sell the party line to other people who haven't double checked to see if their ideology is compatible with their religion.\n\nTL;DR: It's a scam to get you to vote against your interests.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1afuqz", "selftext": "can't like this status enough.  thanks for writing it so eloquently.
