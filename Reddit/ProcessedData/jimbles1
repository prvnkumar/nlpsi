Frank J. Wilson investigated Capone's income tax violations, which the government decided was more likely material for a conviction. In 1931 Capone was indicted for income tax evasion and various violations of the Volstead Act (Prohibition) at the Chicago Federal Building in the courtroom of Judge James Herbert Wilkerson. His attorneys made a plea deal, but the presiding judge warned he might not follow the sentencing recommendation from the prosecution. Capone withdrew his plea of guilty.\n\n&gt;His attempt to bribe and intimidate the potential jurors was discovered by Ness's men, The Untouchables. The venire (jury pool) was switched with one from another case, and Capone was stymied. Following a long trial, on October 17 the jury returned a mixed verdict, finding Capone guilty of five counts of tax evasion and failing to file tax returns (the Volstead Act violations were dropped). The judge sentenced him to 11 years imprisonment, at the time the longest tax evasion sentence ever given, along with heavy fines, and liens were filed against his various properties. His appeals of both the conviction and the sentence were denied. One of the Capone properties seized by the federal government was an armored limousine. The limousine was later used to protect President Franklin D. Roosevelt after the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\n&gt;In ... \n`(Truncated at 1500 characters)`\n\n---\n\n[^(about AutoWikibot)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| *^\\/u/xrelaht ^can ^reply ^with ^'delete'. ^Will ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less.*  ^| ^[**Summon**](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1wc2n8", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cf17026", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1390941562", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "xrelaht", "id": "t1_cf16zzg", "parent_id": "t1_cf109mp", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1435514145, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ah, tax violation: [backup charge for over 80 years!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Capone#Conviction_and_imprisonment)", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1wc2n8", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cf16zzg", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1390941557", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Xing_the_Rubicon", "id": "t1_cf109mp", "parent_id": "t1_cf0x1q0", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1432144732, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cf109mp", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1390927948", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "jimbles1", "id": "t1_cf0x1q0", "parent_id": "t1_cf0kp4s", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1432143067, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1wc2n8", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cf0x1q0", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1390919881", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}

Joe has a pre-existing condition and cannot find health insurance.\n\nTo help Joe, the government says insurance companies cannot discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nJoe can now get health insurance and gets healthy.\n\nMeet Cindy.  Cindy is a relatively healthy individual with no foreseeable health needs and thus does not have health insurance.\n\nCindy suddenly gets requires medical treatment due to unforeseen conditions.  Because she is no longer barred from getting health insurance, she decides now is the time to purchase insurance and she will drop it when she gets better.  She gets the advantages of insurance without the price.\n\nThis arrangement isn't very fair to Anne.  Anne has had health insurance and now sees her premiums increase because Cindy (and others like her) more or less are skipping out on the bill.  Insurance is a shared risk endeavor yet Cindy never assumes other people's risk, only her own - and even then, only partly.  The other part is shared by Anne.  Anne shares part of Cindy's risk yet Cindy doesn't much share any of Anne's.\n\nSo we have a few viable options here:\n\n* Make health insurance universal such that Cindy cannot skip out on the shared risk.\n\n* Make health insurance bar pre-existing conditions such that Cindy cannot get insurance at all, at the cost of Joe not receiving any.\n\n* Maybe there are more, but the above two are what we have now and what we used to have.\n\nThis is why the mandate exists.  You can't get the pre-existing conditions thing without the mandate (or some other universal system [e.g. single payer]).\n\nETA: I agree insurance shouldn't be dictated by demographic like that.  However, that is how it is and the law operates in that framework.  Sure, insurance should maybe be individually assessed for risk, but that's not really how the system works currently.  My issue with the ACA isn't that it *acknowledges* this, but rather it exploits it.  In all honesty, a single payer system would've made the inequities of insurance disappear, yet Americans have decided they want to still have private care.

A speeding ticket is a consequence of performing a particular action in a particular way, whereas the necessity for health care is simply by living - there are not necessarily **always** particularly performed actions which cause the need for health care to arise (although they do exist) other than merely living (which is kind of an \"every-man\" condition).  Or, to put it more simply: driving means you've entered a veritable contract where breaking the terms of that contract are punishable; however, living is a default state without contract and thus monitors upon it are more matter of fact.  *If* you think we can reconcile driving with being the existential equivalent of living, then sure, I can concede a speeding ticket is not a punishment.  Yet the two aren't equal, thus the metaphor is bad.  However, as it stands now, it's money owed to the government *as a punishment* regardless, and I don't care if it's called a tax, an impost, an excise, a fine, or whatever.\n\nLastly: a lack of medical insurance classifies you as a financial risk to a generic healthcare provider.

Joe has a pre-existing condition and cannot find health insurance.\n\nTo help Joe, the government says insurance companies cannot discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nJoe can now get health insurance and gets healthy.\n\nMeet Cindy.  Cindy is a relatively healthy individual with no foreseeable health needs and thus does not have health insurance.\n\nCindy suddenly gets requires medical treatment due to unforeseen conditions.  Because she is no longer barred from getting health insurance, she decides now is the time to purchase insurance and she will drop it when she gets better.  She gets the advantages of insurance without the price.\n\nThis arrangement isn't very fair to Anne.  Anne has had health insurance and now sees her premiums increase because Cindy (and others like her) more or less are skipping out on the bill.  Insurance is a shared risk endeavor yet Cindy never assumes other people's risk, only her own - and even then, only partly.  The other part is shared by Anne.  Anne shares part of Cindy's risk yet Cindy doesn't much share any of Anne's.\n\nSo we have a few viable options here:\n\n* Make health insurance universal such that Cindy cannot skip out on the shared risk.\n\n* Make health insurance bar pre-existing conditions such that Cindy cannot get insurance at all, at the cost of Joe not receiving any.\n\n* Maybe there are more, but the above two are what we have now and what we used to have.\n\nThis is why the mandate exists.

It really is a semantic argument.  To imply it is not a semantic argument is to suppose the difference between a tax and a fine isn't negligible.  When things are said and done, it still is money owed to the government either way, which is why the fine/tax debate purely is semantics. \n\n&gt;[[Semantics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics)] is often used in ordinary language for denoting a problem of understanding that comes down to word selection or connotation.\n\nAs far as dismissing intentions goes, I needn't consider a historical context through which a law is passed in order to understand the law.  This is why legal language exists - to establish itself in its *own* contexts, clear of ambiguities.  Yes, the law fails to do this repeatedly, but that's either a failure of the lawmakers, and not the way in which law operates, or a matter for court systems to adjudicate.\n\nWe're supposing a wildly hypothetical situation which I don't believe translates one-to-one.  A speeding ticket is a consequence of performing a particular action in a particular way, whereas the necessity for health care is simply by living - there are not necessarily **always** particularly performed actions which cause the need for health care to arise (although they do exist) other than merely living (which is kind of an \"every-man\" condition).  Or, to put it more simply: driving means you've entered a veritable contract where breaking the terms of that contract are punishable; however, living is a default state without contract and thus monitors upon it are more matter of fact.  *If* you think we can reconcile driving with being the existential equivalent of living, then sure, I can concede a speeding ticket is not a punishment.  Yet the two aren't equal, thus the metaphor is bad.  However, as it stands now, it's money owed to the government *as a punishment* regardless, and I don't care if it's called a tax, an impost, an excise, a fine, or whatever.\n\nLastly: a lack of medical insurance classifies you as a financial risk to a generic healthcare provider.  Whether or not you really are such a risk or whether or not this is fair is another question, as the assumption being made when examining the law is with the system as it currently exists.  You in particular might not be a risk, but the aggregate is.  As such, the healthcare provider must assume more risk in your care and tamp it through you and other customers (risk cannot be tacked entirely to you as that doesn't make sense for a healthcare provider to assign financial burden to the financially risky alone).", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ccujbr1", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1382125936", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_ccuhjm8", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1429083418, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ccuierm", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1382123690", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_ccuhat6", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1429083821, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;It was created and presented as a fine, which absolutely is a form of punishment.\n\nI don't really want to rehash this, so I'll just directly quote from [my earlier post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1ooq6p/why_does_the_tea_partygop_hate_the_aca_so_much/ccuctbm) which maybe you didn't read (and what the heck, I'll even add emphasis):\n\n&gt;The Supreme Court made **the fine \"survive as a tax,\"** and thus it is a tax and not a fine (if those semantics matter to you).\n\n&gt;&gt;They did call it a fine, and they did intend for it to be a punishment for non-compliance.\n\n&gt;**Intention is not how laws work.**  If it were, loopholes would not exist.

Joe has a pre-existing condition and cannot find health insurance.\n\nTo help Joe, the government says insurance companies cannot discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nJoe can now get health insurance and gets healthy.\n\nMeet Cindy.  Cindy is a relatively healthy individual with no foreseeable health needs and thus does not have health insurance.\n\nCindy suddenly gets requires medical treatment due to unforeseen conditions.  Because she is no longer barred from getting health insurance, she decides now is the time to purchase insurance and she will drop it when she gets better.  She gets the advantages of insurance without the price.\n\nThis arrangement isn't very fair to Anne.  Anne has had health insurance and now sees her premiums increase because Cindy (and others like her) more or less are skipping out on the bill.  Insurance is a shared risk endeavor yet Cindy never assumes other people's risk, only her own - and even then, only partly.  The other part is shared by Anne.  Anne shares part of Cindy's risk yet Cindy doesn't much share any of Anne's.\n\nSo we have a few viable options here:\n\n* Make health insurance universal such that Cindy cannot skip out on the shared risk.\n\n* Make health insurance bar pre-existing conditions such that Cindy cannot get insurance at all, at the cost of Joe not receiving any.\n\n* Maybe there are more, but the above two are what we have now and what we used to have.\n\nThis is why the mandate exists.  You can't get the pre-existing conditions thing without the mandate (or some other universal system [e.g. single payer]).\n\nETA: I agree insurance shouldn't be dictated by demographic like that.  However, that is how it is and the law operates in that framework.  Sure, insurance should maybe be individually assessed for risk, but that's not really how the system works currently.  My issue with the ACA isn't that it *acknowledges* this, but rather it exploits it.  In all honesty, a single payer system would've made the inequities of insurance disappear, yet Americans have decided they want to still have private care.

It really is a semantic argument.  To imply it is not a semantic argument is to suppose the difference between a tax and a fine isn't negligible.  When things are said and done, it still is money owed to the government either way, which is why the fine/tax debate purely is semantics. \n\n&gt;[[Semantics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics)] is often used in ordinary language for denoting a problem of understanding that comes down to word selection or connotation.\n\nAs far as dismissing intentions goes, I needn't consider a historical context through which a law is passed in order to understand the law.  This is why legal language exists - to establish itself in its *own* contexts, clear of ambiguities.  Yes, the law fails to do this repeatedly, but that's either a failure of the lawmakers, and not the way in which law operates, or a matter for court systems to adjudicate.\n\nWe're supposing a wildly hypothetical situation which I don't believe translates one-to-one.  A speeding ticket is a consequence of performing a particular action in a particular way, whereas the necessity for health care is simply by living - there are not necessarily **always** particularly performed actions which cause the need for health care to arise (although they do exist) other than merely living (which is kind of an \"every-man\" condition).  Or, to put it more simply: driving means you've entered a veritable contract where breaking the terms of that contract are punishable; however, living is a default state without contract and thus monitors upon it are more matter of fact.  *If* you think we can reconcile driving with being the existential equivalent of living, then sure, I can concede a speeding ticket is not a punishment.  Yet the two aren't equal, thus the metaphor is bad.  However, as it stands now, it's money owed to the government *as a punishment* regardless, and I don't care if it's called a tax, an impost, an excise, a fine, or whatever.\n\nLastly: a lack of medical insurance classifies you as a financial risk to a generic healthcare provider.  Whether or not you really are such a risk or whether or not this is fair is another question, as the assumption being made when examining the law is with the system as it currently exists.  You in particular might not be a risk, but the aggregate is.  As such, the healthcare provider must assume more risk in your care and tamp it through you and other customers (risk cannot be tacked entirely to you as that doesn't make sense for a healthcare provider to assign financial burden to the financially risky alone).", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ccujbr1", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1382125936", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_ccuhjm8", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1429083418, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ccuierm", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1382123690", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_ccuhat6", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1429083821, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;It was created and presented as a fine, which absolutely is a form of punishment.\n\nI don't really want to rehash this, so I'll just directly quote from [my earlier post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1ooq6p/why_does_the_tea_partygop_hate_the_aca_so_much/ccuctbm) which maybe you didn't read (and what the heck, I'll even add emphasis):\n\n&gt;The Supreme Court made **the fine \"survive as a tax,\"** and thus it is a tax and not a fine (if those semantics matter to you).\n\n&gt;&gt;They did call it a fine, and they did intend for it to be a punishment for non-compliance.\n\n&gt;**Intention is not how laws work.**  If it were, loopholes would not exist.

Then go look at spending. Maybe you'll see what really happened...\n\n-\n\nThe data you refer to, in millions of dollars: \n\n    Receipts          2,567,985 \n    Outlays           2,728,686 \n    Surplus/Deficit    -160,701 \n\nI also checked the [Wikipedia article on the 2007 budget](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_United_States_federal_budget) for reference. \n\nNow, we were in a bubble in 2007, so numbers compared to the long term were skewed, but I suppose this is really no argument from most economic theorist standpoints, during the good times you should have a surplus to cover the debt from stimulus in the bad times. However, the reason I mention it is because being in a bubble would be increasing our tax revenue, and our revenues in 2007 were particularly high.  \n\nSomething the Wikipedia article has that the data you linked does not have (or at least not easily read if it is there) is the mention that in 2007 we had an estimated [$345 billion in uncollected taxes](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15111003). Tallying this up with the receipts and stacking it against expenditures has us basically reaching the budget without a deficit when comparing it to data from the source you linked, in fact, I had originally assumed this would still have us borrowing from the Social Security Trust Fund, but this would eat all of the roughly $343 billion dollar deficit that stems from \"on budget\" spending that is outside the Trust Funds, before figuring the cost of collection. \n\nI suppose from here the question is, without the Bush tax cuts would we have at least made budget, even if we had to borrow from some of our Trust Funds? Finding this information wasn't as easy, [but the CBO had an article on this](http://www.cbo.gov/publication/41463), that links to a PDF with the data. The \"Bush tax cuts\" are EGTRRA and JGTRRA as listed if [Wikipedia is to be believed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_tax_cuts). Ignoring the minor outlay increases, the receipts changes of both of these together is roughly $156 billion, still short of making the total deficit for that year. \n\nSo while the Bush tax cuts would only put a dent in the deficit for the year 2007, uncollected taxes being collected would have just about eliminated them, and together we would have had a decent surplus. While this isn't to say there wasn't room for more efficiency in our spending at the time (2007 or earlier would have been the perfect time to make spending more efficient since it was during either economic growth or a bubble), it is really enlightening about what \"really happened\".

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1lgbqh", "selftext": "I don't want to make a blanket statement that they are **all** bad, or **all** good. They were born out of unbearable working conditions, and employers who treated their employees pretty terribly *because there were no laws saying otherwise*. They were necessary then. Now you can't even milk a cow and sell it without having to jump through a phonebook's worth of regulations. But we want to think that the government is *under-regulated* with laws protecting workers? The function of unions in the early days were to provide a safe work environment. But now that the government ensures that, their function has changed. Today their role, (for the most part, I've been a part of many unions) is to provide luxuries and additional benefits. Now there are some industries that federal law hasn't caught up with, and unions are actually necessary in protecting the workers. I've been a part of those too. \n\nI've worked more non-union jobs than union. My working conditions have always been acceptable. My bosses have always been lawful. I've never been abused or mistreated. My job might have sucked, and I might have had asshole bosses, but nothing so bad that outside intervention was necessary. So I don't find them *necessary*. I do understand the value they serve though.\n\nBut I'm against them for how bad they made the reality of work. First, I had to pay union dues. That's fair, because you think of all the wonderful things they're supposed to be providing you. But my salary was always commiserate with other non-unionized companies.  I never made significantly more, and you could argue I even made less since the little more they did get me went to dues. My health insurance wasn't any better than the non-union companies who I also worked for in the same field. They made it nearly impossible to get rid of bad workers. It's great to think everyone has a wonderful work ethic, but a lot of people don't. They've got guaranteed hours, a guaranteed raise, and virtually can't be fired. It was a breeding ground for people with a terrible work ethic, actually. The unionized companies would make promotions based on seniority. Which means instead of management spots being run by the most qualified person for the job, they were run by people who just didn't screw up so bad that they hadn't been fired yet. Then comes election season. Holy shit. My girlfriend at the time who worked with me lived in a really bad area. They would come banging on her door late at night to make sure she knew to go vote the next day for whatever guy they told us to. Can you imagine being an unmarried woman living in a bad area, having people bang on your door at crazy hours of the night? *Constant* harassment anytime a meeting was scheduled, telling you to attend. My brother is a fireman who had to join their union. He is also a volunteer for the town we grew up in. The *first* thing they told him was to not tell anyone he was a volunteer since he was giving away the services they charge for. Here's a guy who risks his life for his neighbors for no pay, out of the kindness of his heart and willingness to help his community, and the first thing he's told is that makes *them* look bad, so don't talk about it. I know there are good ones out there. But the ones I've ever had interactions with were scummy, ineffectual or both.

[I'm sure you know this is a logical fallacy, and that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Absence_of_evidence) But in case you don't, I'll do my best to shred some light on the subject. There are two main reasons you won't find many cases of voter fraud. \n\nOne, and most importantly, the system we use to keep track of who is registered where is incredibly out of date. Just a cursory browsing of who is currently registered and allowed to vote in our town, I found 20 people I *personally* know who do not live in our town anymore, and are registered in another town. And even though I know this, I can't correct that error. There's a very lengthy process of notifying them and the state. By the time it gets corrected, 6 months can easily go by. And that's if I catch it, and if I even know the person. Do you know how many people I *don't* know? There could be a whole bus of people voting in two places and we would have no way of even knowing because of how obsolete our system is. And even if I *did* know someone who came in who is registered somewhere else, I have to let them vote. There's really nothing I can do about it. As far as the \"official\" paperwork I have is concerned, they're allowed to. If I suspect something is fishy, the best I can do is make them sign an affidavit, but then I'm getting close to \"discriminating\". Which leads me to the second reason: resources. Do you have any idea how expensive it is to bring litigation against someone? Even if we did have reasonable suspicion to believe someone committed voter fraud, we'd go bankrupt just trying to prove it. Court costs and attorney fees would just drain our budget on prosecuting one person. And we might not even win! But you're taking the realities of the situation and using them (wrongly) as evidence that a problem doesn't exist. \n&gt;But seriously, please please please give me an example of voter fraud? \n\nGiven the antiquated system and procedural roadblocks, I'd abandon this type of argument from now on. I live in a major Democrat state (CT), but not one Democrat Registrar I know is for loosening voter laws. This is a position that's more popular with people who don't actually have to work on the implementation side of voting.

I've repeatedly informed you that this same process is occurring today in many countries abroad. This is not just a historical example from America. In America however, the historical example does apply.

First, there would be less, simpler laws. We wouldn't need a thousand different laws that say \"don't fuck this guy over\". We'd have one law that said it. It also reduces and can eliminate many of the loop holes defense attorney's rely on now to win their case. Most of the time it's not that they proved their client didn't do something wrong, they just got away based on a technicality. That's an important factor that needs to be addressed. There's also a justified worry that a private citizen would never be able to afford to bring a law suit to a large company or corporation, and so the free market would just run wild. That's also addressed in a libertarian judicial system. Since one of the very few roles of government we believe in is protecting citizens from those who have caused them harm, the victim would be represented by the government. Like a public defender, but with the resources of the DoJ. This puts private citizens on par with big companies, putting one giant up against another. In the case of real, monetary damages, strong property rights will trump federal regulation every time.\n\nBut you mention a good point that not all pollution can be quantified by a monetary damage. The difference here is between compensation vs restitution. You sue the company that dumps garbage on your land for compensation for the actual monetary damage done. It covers your losses. But in the case of air pollution for example, where you might not have incurred a monetary injury, you would still sue for restitution. This is in place precisely to punish the offending polluter. They've committed an act of aggression against you by putting pollutants in the air you breathe against your will. Theft is still theft, whether its stealing a nickel or a $100. And aggression is still aggression whether they put bad shit in the air or break your leg. So pretend you're a company in the middle of a neighborhood pumping all sorts of nasty chemicals in the air. Every single person in that neighborhood has a claim against you, both for compensation and restitution, and their case is represented by the government. Every time you do this, they have a new claim against you. They continue to sue, they continue to win. Your prices skyrocket. Either you need to charge more, in which case you'll lose so many customers you go out of business, or you innovate your energy system so it doesn't cause the reason you're being sued. But you won't be able to maintain the model of polluting all you want and continuing to pay the victims without having to alter anything. It's completely unsustainable. \n\nLook, it's never going to happen. So debating this too much and too passionately is going to be a waste of time pretty soon.

The problem with pollution in the real world is precisely that the individual damage caused by a single polluter (eg. one car or one factory) seems neglible, but the aggregated collective impact of many polluters (eg. lots of cars, or lots of factories) causes very real and dangerous problems. To the extent that you're talking only about pollution \"in a very obscene, measurable way,\" you're essentially admitting that the libertarian solution doesn't have an adequate response to the actual problems most typically associated with pollution, only to some simplistic caricature of the problem that exists only in your head.\n\n&gt; Second, I think an issue is your taking the country exactly as it is now, but throwing it under a libertarian government in the blink of an eye and saying, \"See! You can't fix this!\". So let's assume there's some sort of transitional period, where the car manufacturers and factories know instead of having to pay a fine, they can be sued by every single person they directly affect with their pollution.

The problem now lies in determining who is the source of all this pollution? The courts will have information on all car's emission, and the same with factories. So instead of tracking down individual offenders, you go after the maker.\n\nThat doesn't address my point at all, which was that it is impractical to parse out *which polluters* caused the losses in question. You can have all the information you want about different cars' emission rates, but in any given lawsuit, how could the plaintiff possibly prove that he developed lung cancer (or whatever) because of the Mercury Sable as opposed to the Toyota Camry, the Dodge Ram, or the brother-in-law who smokes? Realistically, *all* of those pollutants, along with hundreds more, were present and probably each contributed some small effect. The harm also probably took place gradually, over a long period of time, which means lots of the polluters might no longer exist by the time the damage is noticed. How, then, could a plaintiff possibly prove the liability of any specific defendant? And, by extension, if the plaintiff cannot possibly prove definitively who caused the harm in question, what incentive do any of the polluters have to make changes? And remember, these are not artificial parameters I'm imagining or \"straw manning\" -- this is simply the nature of the problem you say you have a better solution to.\n\n&gt; Again, we're using the justice system as it stands today, rather than the one libertarians propose. Yeah, it wouldn't really work now because it's so incredibly expensive. No one would be able to afford a good lawyer, so companies would just go nuts over pollution. What's stopping them? The are two big differences in a libertarian society. 1, the laws are much simpler. To the point that you can and should be able to defend/prosecute for yourself. 2.

Lawyers will still exist, but mostly for the purposes of defense. And again, the law is really on your side. Libertarians are unflinching in their belief that you can't negatively affect someone else. Even a little.\n\nNothing about your solution meets those criteria, however. It's NOT much simpler for a layman to prove whether Toyota caused his cancer rather than Chevrolet or Marlboro than it is for the government to regulate how much of certain substances can be released into the air (or whatever). It's much, much more complex -- not only legalistically, but scientifically. We simply can't trace microscopic molecules back to their source with any degree of accuracy that would hold up in court. For the government to undertake such a task -- investigating the individual path histories of microscopic windborne and waterborne molecules, for hundreds of millions of people who are affected daily by pollution, multiplies by hundreds or more pollution sources that contribute to pollution in even just a small area, and then for each, standing up in court and spending countless hours trying to prove their conclusions beyond a reasonable doubt -- would be so complex, bloated, and expensive as to undermine the entire libertarian ideology if the task were even plausible in the first place (which I don't think it is).\n\n&gt; Finally, (you're straw-maning again) \n\nI am? Libertarians don't say we should de-regulate?\n\n&gt; passing a law that says don't pollute doesn't work. We have laws now that say don't pollute, does that mean we don't have a pollution problem anymore?\n\nThe US has extremely weak anti-pollution laws, many of which were written by the polluters themselves. Other countries have better anti-pollution laws and a smaller pollution problem. Your argument is equivalent to saying that since my old, sick, three-legged donkey does a mediocre job pulling his cart, donkeys *in general* can't pull carts. In reality, I may just need a better donkey.\n\nMoreover, we still have a murder problem even though we have laws against murder. We still have a rape problem even though we have laws against rape. It is a completely unreasonable standard to suggest that a policy doesn't work unless it entirely eliminates the problem. The pollution problem *has* gotten measurably *[better](http://www.aei-ideas.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/earthday1.jpg)* since we started regulating pollution better, which would lead most rational people to conclude that the laws do work -- though we can still recognize that our current laws are not necessarily the best possible ones.\n\n&gt; If Dodge still makes the Ram in our libertarian society, exactly the way it is now being the biggest polluting vehicle on the road- they are exposing themselves to lawsuits from the entire country. I'd say that's a hell of a lot worse than the nothing the face now for making a heavily polling vehicle.\n\nThat's only true if it's actually plausible to definitively connect a given defendant's loss specifically to the Dodge Ram itself. If that connection is prohibitively difficult to parse out, then Dodge has no incentive whatsoever to change its behavior in your libertarian society.

Do you realize the scale of that idea? For cars alone you are going to have to track the use, mileage, depreciation of mileage over time, upkeep on all cars, modifications of the cars that affect mileage, how I drive my car, etc. Not to mention they are going to have to track every step in the chain of production, shipping, distribution, and sale of every car that pollutes, you realize the massive scale of that right? That doesn't sound like small government in the least bit, rather I think that borders on NSA level invasion of privacy. That would cost millions if not billions of dollars and manhours to implement, carry out, and upkeep. Think about your proposition, sorry that borders on the absurd.\n\nRather than having regulatory agencies with power to litigate you think we should all be able to sue people that pollute, and only when that pollution affects us. What defines affects us? You are going to have to figure out how someone died and if in the course of their life they were exposed to pollution that decreased their life span/contributed to their death. IF that is on the burden of the family, good luck having most people carry that out most are going to be too poor, lazy, or stupid to take the time to do so. Like most every other step you propose that is going to require a team of scientists to figure out the cause of death and how that was effected by pollution. IF that is on the shoulders of the government to figure out, again I challenge the idea that this is a libertarian idea at all since it would result in a massive expansion of government to track, litigate, and process all of this information. On this same topic how do we figure out who polluted and what percentage of the \"pollution pie\" they are responsible for? The individual is going to have to hire an army of statisticians and scientists to track that information and to put it into a form they can understand (since you argue I, not my attorney, will be taking them to court... a problem I will address later). How is that manageable in any way? Not only are you expecting people to pay for their own legal team or take the case to court themselves ( a laughable idea) but you are expecting them to do all the required research to argue their case. You are creating institutional barriers to litigation every step of the way. Even if that information is available from the NPA (national pollution agency, you would be creating it) you are going to require people to process the information themselves and to sift through the mountain of information for data that relates to their case as well, and you expect people to do this in their free time after working 40 hours a week? Do you assume that no one has anything to do after working all day or do you assume that people are all legal and data crunching machines that would be able to create a well crafted legal argument in their sleep?\n\nYou claim that people are going to be able to defend themselves because the law will be so simple anyone can bring a lawsuit...your system just put millions of attorneys out of business and created a business environment where every company (big or small) has to fear and prepare for countless lawsuits from everyone (remember according to you, if pollution affected you then you can sue). You basically ran businesses out of business by creating a litigious system that makes our current epoch look tame. You also just created an environment where Big company A can sue little company B for pollution, or find a plaintiff to sue through, and basically run smaller companies out of business through litigation.\n\nYou said we are going to have our own justice department? What on the earth does that mean? You seem to be creating a massive legal bureaucracy rather than simplifying things in anyway. \n\nYour statement on the libertarian ethos that you can't negatively affect anyone. Where is the line? Like I said above you are going to require people to sue every step in the chain of production for restitution of damages.\n\nSorry but your idea borders on the crazy. Instead of simplifying things your system will make it so dangerous to do business, of any kind really, that you are going to destroy private business. Your system is even more litigious than our current system and creates a toxic and fearful business environment that would do more harm than good. I don't think you have considered the scale or scope of pollution in relation to your libertarian dream, if you did I believe you would reconsider.

You basically ran businesses out of business by creating a litigious system that makes our current epoch look tame. You also just created an environment where Big company A can sue little company B for pollution, or find a plaintiff to sue through, and basically run smaller companies out of business through litigation.\n\nYou said we are going to have our own justice department? What on the earth does that mean? You seem to be creating a massive legal bureaucracy rather than simplifying things in anyway. \n\nYour statement on the libertarian ethos that you can't negatively affect anyone. Where is the line?

Instead of simplifying things your system will make it so dangerous to do business, of any kind really, that you are going to destroy private business. Your system is even more litigious than our current system and creates a toxic and fearful business environment that would do more harm than good.

If you are taking on a multimillion(billion even) dollar company you want a damn good attorney. \n\nCompany X has great attorneys that are on call 24/7 for situations like this, that is their bread and butter they are experts in environmental and tort law. You on the other hand make (let's say the median income in the United States of $50,000). You now have to (A) find an environmental/tort lawyer that is able and willing to take on company X (B) have the time to work with your attorney to get the case ready (they do much of the work but with a 40 hour work week for you, that is going to chew up a good bit of your free time) (C) you have to have the funds to pay your attorney to research the case, argue the case, argue the appeal of the case (you win they are going to appeal, you lose I assume you would want to appeal as well).\n\nThe problem is that this gets very expensive very fast. Unless you have an attorney that wants to fight this case probono or a legal group that wants to represent you for free the \"libertarian court system\" solves nothing. It might even make more sense to the company, if we limited environmental laws and rather relied on the tort system instead as I believe you are implying, to pollute (safe and responsible removal and destruction of waste is expensive) and just settle lawsuits against them. If it costs them $2 million to dispose of chemical Y (causes cancer, AIDS, birth defects, and general unhappiness) but they can use settle a suit for $1.9 million with you for dumping it in your lake why the heck not? No the libertarian court system does not solve this problem rather it enables companies to pollute more when effective and still hampers the ability of average citizens to fight pollution.\n\nLoopholes are not the problem at all, the problem rather is that we have weak protections for the environment and hamper the ability of government agencies tasked with protecting us to do their job. Tort law in the US is actually pretty good at enabling us to go after polluters (in theory, but reality is much different), the problem is that companies can settle a case for millions and still make a profit, or just fight you into the ground until you give up or accept their settlement. Instead of foolishly relying on me to take on billiondollarcorp, they can and will beat me 99% of the time for reasons I said above, we need to enable governments, who (should) have the time, money, expertise, and ability to go after companies that are polluting.

Do you assume that no one has anything to do after working all day or do you assume that people are all legal and data crunching machines that would be able to create a well crafted legal argument in their sleep?\n\nYou claim that people are going to be able to defend themselves because the law will be so simple anyone can bring a lawsuit...your system just put millions of attorneys out of business and created a business environment where every company (big or small) has to fear and prepare for countless lawsuits from everyone (remember according to you, if pollution affected you then you can sue). You basically ran businesses out of business by creating a litigious system that makes our current epoch look tame. You also just created an environment where Big company A can sue little company B for pollution, or find a plaintiff to sue through, and basically run smaller companies out of business through litigation.\n\nYou said we are going to have our own justice department? What on the earth does that mean? You seem to be creating a massive legal bureaucracy rather than simplifying things in anyway. \n\nYour statement on the libertarian ethos that you can't negatively affect anyone. Where is the line? Like I said above you are going to require people to sue every step in the chain of production for restitution of damages.\n\nSorry but your idea borders on the crazy. Instead of simplifying things your system will make it so dangerous to do business, of any kind really, that you are going to destroy private business. Your system is even more litigious than our current system and creates a toxic and fearful business environment that would do more harm than good. I don't think you have considered the scale or scope of pollution in relation to your libertarian dream, if you did I believe you would reconsider.

You on the other hand make (let's say the median income in the United States of $50,000). You now have to (A) find an environmental/tort lawyer that is able and willing to take on company X (B) have the time to work with your attorney to get the case ready (they do much of the work but with a 40 hour work week for you, that is going to chew up a good bit of your free time) (C) you have to have the funds to pay your attorney to research the case, argue the case, argue the appeal of the case (you win they are going to appeal, you lose I assume you would want to appeal as well).\n\nThe problem is that this gets very expensive very fast. Unless you have an attorney that wants to fight this case probono or a legal group that wants to represent you for free the \"libertarian court system\" solves nothing. It might even make more sense to the company, if we limited environmental laws and rather relied on the tort system instead as I believe you are implying, to pollute (safe and responsible removal and destruction of waste is expensive) and just settle lawsuits against them.

No the libertarian court system does not solve this problem rather it enables companies to pollute more when effective and still hampers the ability of average citizens to fight pollution.\n\nLoopholes are not the problem at all, the problem rather is that we have weak protections for the environment and hamper the ability of government agencies tasked with protecting us to do their job. Tort law in the US is actually pretty good at enabling us to go after polluters (in theory, but reality is much different), the problem is that companies can settle a case for millions and still make a profit, or just fight you into the ground until you give up or accept their settlement.

I've repeatedly informed you that this same process is occurring today in many countries abroad. This is not just a historical example from America. In America however, the historical example does apply.

I've found that when people purposefully identify themselves as socialists, they are making a stark distinction between that and liberalism. \n\nAnyway, the libertarian judicial system is not the same as the system we currently have. First, there would be less, simpler laws. We wouldn't need a thousand different laws that say \"don't fuck this guy over\". We'd have one law that said it. It also reduces and can eliminate many of the loop holes defense attorney's rely on now to win their case. Most of the time it's not that they proved their client didn't do something wrong, they just got away based on a technicality. That's an important factor that needs to be addressed. There's also a justified worry that a private citizen would never be able to afford to bring a law suit to a large company or corporation, and so the free market would just run wild. That's also addressed in a libertarian judicial system. Since one of the very few roles of government we believe in is protecting citizens from those who have caused them harm, the victim would be represented by the government. Like a public defender, but with the resources of the DoJ. This puts private citizens on par with big companies, putting one giant up against another. In the case of real, monetary damages, strong property rights will trump federal regulation every time.\n\nBut you mention a good point that not all pollution can be quantified by a monetary damage. The difference here is between compensation vs restitution. You sue the company that dumps garbage on your land for compensation for the actual monetary damage done. It covers your losses. But in the case of air pollution for example, where you might not have incurred a monetary injury, you would still sue for restitution. This is in place precisely to punish the offending polluter. They've committed an act of aggression against you by putting pollutants in the air you breathe against your will. Theft is still theft, whether its stealing a nickel or a $100. And aggression is still aggression whether they put bad shit in the air or break your leg. So pretend you're a company in the middle of a neighborhood pumping all sorts of nasty chemicals in the air. Every single person in that neighborhood has a claim against you, both for compensation and restitution, and their case is represented by the government. Every time you do this, they have a new claim against you. They continue to sue, they continue to win. Your prices skyrocket. Either you need to charge more, in which case you'll lose so many customers you go out of business, or you innovate your energy system so it doesn't cause the reason you're being sued. But you won't be able to maintain the model of polluting all you want and continuing to pay the victims without having to alter anything. It's completely unsustainable. \n\nLook, it's never going to happen. So debating this too much and too passionately is going to be a waste of time pretty soon. I happen to think that an entire population with the prosecution powers of the Department of Justice threatening to sue a polluter has a lot more teeth, than just implementing a fine if they pollute more than the law says they can. I think it hits them a lot harder where it hurts, and much more often. But yes, it largely depends on a huge change with our judicial system.

They had inspections and threat of penalties. They didn't stop anything. You know what got their ass in gear? Being sued.

I'm positive they would make changes, but let's assume they don't. The first question is, what are your losses in this scenario? Health issues? Property value decreased? Let's assume it's something measurable. And let's also assume that since it's so bad that it's measurable, you're not the only one having this issue. It's affecting the entire area. The problem now lies in determining who is the source of all this pollution? The courts will have information on all car's emission, and the same with factories. So instead of tracking down individual offenders, you go after the maker. Which leads us to your third point.\n\nAgain, we're using the justice system as it stands today, rather than the one libertarians propose. Yeah, it wouldn't really work now because it's so incredibly expensive. No one would be able to afford a good lawyer, so companies would just go nuts over pollution. What's stopping them? The are two big differences in a libertarian society. 1, the laws are much simpler. To the point that you can and should be able to defend/prosecute for yourself. 2. That even if you can't prosecute or defend yourself, it's a tenet that you're protected against injuries. The government is your lawyer. You have your own Justice Department. Lawyers will still exist, but mostly for the purposes of defense. And again, the law is really on your side. Libertarians are unflinching in their belief that you can't negatively affect someone else. Even a little.  \n\nFinally, (you're straw-maning again) passing a law that says don't pollute doesn't work.

I'm positive they would make changes, but let's assume they don't. The first question is, what are your losses in this scenario? Health issues? Property value decreased? Let's assume it's something measurable. And let's also assume that since it's so bad that it's measurable, you're not the only one having this issue. It's affecting the entire area. The problem now lies in determining who is the source of all this pollution? The courts will have information on all car's emission, and the same with factories. So instead of tracking down individual offenders, you go after the maker.\n\nThat doesn't address my point at all, which was that it is impractical to parse out *which polluters* caused the losses in question. You can have all the information you want about different cars' emission rates, but in any given lawsuit, how could the plaintiff possibly prove that he developed lung cancer (or whatever) because of the Mercury Sable as opposed to the Toyota Camry, the Dodge Ram, or the brother-in-law who smokes? Realistically, *all* of those pollutants, along with hundreds more, were present and probably each contributed some small effect. The harm also probably took place gradually, over a long period of time, which means lots of the polluters might no longer exist by the time the damage is noticed. How, then, could a plaintiff possibly prove the liability of any specific defendant? And, by extension, if the plaintiff cannot possibly prove definitively who caused the harm in question, what incentive do any of the polluters have to make changes? And remember, these are not artificial parameters I'm imagining or \"straw manning\" -- this is simply the nature of the problem you say you have a better solution to.\n\n&gt; Again, we're using the justice system as it stands today, rather than the one libertarians propose. Yeah, it wouldn't really work now because it's so incredibly expensive. No one would be able to afford a good lawyer, so companies would just go nuts over pollution. What's stopping them? The are two big differences in a libertarian society. 1, the laws are much simpler. To the point that you can and should be able to defend/prosecute for yourself. 2. That even if you can't prosecute or defend yourself, it's a tenet that you're protected against injuries. The government is your lawyer. You have your own Justice Department. Lawyers will still exist, but mostly for the purposes of defense. And again, the law is really on your side. Libertarians are unflinching in their belief that you can't negatively affect someone else. Even a little.\n\nNothing about your solution meets those criteria, however. It's NOT much simpler for a layman to prove whether Toyota caused his cancer rather than Chevrolet or Marlboro than it is for the government to regulate how much of certain substances can be released into the air (or whatever). It's much, much more complex -- not only legalistically, but scientifically. We simply can't trace microscopic molecules back to their source with any degree of accuracy that would hold up in court. For the government to undertake such a task -- investigating the individual path histories of microscopic windborne and waterborne molecules, for hundreds of millions of people who are affected daily by pollution, multiplies by hundreds or more pollution sources that contribute to pollution in even just a small area, and then for each, standing up in court and spending countless hours trying to prove their conclusions beyond a reasonable doubt -- would be so complex, bloated, and expensive as to undermine the entire libertarian ideology if the task were even plausible in the first place (which I don't think it is).\n\n&gt; Finally, (you're straw-maning again) \n\nI am? Libertarians don't say we should de-regulate?\n\n&gt; passing a law that says don't pollute doesn't work. We have laws now that say don't pollute, does that mean we don't have a pollution problem anymore?\n\nThe US has extremely weak anti-pollution laws, many of which were written by the polluters themselves. Other countries have better anti-pollution laws and a smaller pollution problem. Your argument is equivalent to saying that since my old, sick, three-legged donkey does a mediocre job pulling his cart, donkeys *in general* can't pull carts. In reality, I may just need a better donkey.\n\nMoreover, we still have a murder problem even though we have laws against murder. We still have a rape problem even though we have laws against rape. It is a completely unreasonable standard to suggest that a policy doesn't work unless it entirely eliminates the problem. The pollution problem *has* gotten measurably *[better](http://www.aei-ideas.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/earthday1.jpg)* since we started regulating pollution better, which would lead most rational people to conclude that the laws do work -- though we can still recognize that our current laws are not necessarily the best possible ones.\n\n&gt; If Dodge still makes the Ram in our libertarian society, exactly the way it is now being the biggest polluting vehicle on the road- they are exposing themselves to lawsuits from the entire country. I'd say that's a hell of a lot worse than the nothing the face now for making a heavily polling vehicle.\n\nThat's only true if it's actually plausible to definitively connect a given defendant's loss specifically to the Dodge Ram itself. If that connection is prohibitively difficult to parse out, then Dodge has no incentive whatsoever to change its behavior in your libertarian society.

I never assumed or said that the new agency you create would be looking for lawsuits, rather my critique rests on the passive collection of information, that would be on a massive scale.\n\nYou open up litigation to everyone, I go to my public defender and want to sue GM for pollution. The new tracking agency is going to have to figure out the pollution that comes from GM vehicles, the production of GM vehicles, shipping them, how modifications affect their pollution levels (up or down), and then compare that to every other car manufacturer because not every car around me is GM rather pollution is caused by multiple factors. Now that new agency is going to have to figure out what portion of the pollution pie is just GM's responsibility and not VW, the coal plant next door, my neighbors smoking, or just hereditary. So even their passive collection of information for just me is going to touch on every individual that I pass in my morning commute, weekend trip, and any other time I leave my house. So yes if my twin brother who has lived with my since birth sues as well they can look at my data and use similar information in the lawsuit. BUT if anyone else wants to sue they basically have to start all over again and compile all of that data all over based on a new set of information. Now multiply that by 313.9 million people, with an infinite set of unique factors to consider, how does that not border on the draconian? If you are going to rely on the individual to sue rather than a government agency you have to have quite a few lawsuits to make any form of impact on their policy, a few lawsuits won't change anything, your theory basically requires that there are tons of lawsuits brought against every car maker to have any affect. Therefore, your new agency is going to be bustling with activity collecting and compiling just the data requested, which based on the nature of pollution (a combination of contributors rather than just one) is going to be massive in scale, they have to compile information on your daily routine to make sure the guilt is properly assigned to each polluting actor. \n\nThat is just cars. Now if we take say a coal powered energy plant the scale just expanded exponentially, not only do you have people within the immediate area of the plant but also those that were along the shipping route (trucks, barges, trains all pollute), everyone near the mine (that operation isn't clean), and everyone that was affected by wind blown pollution from the plant or any other step of the process. \n\nThat was just cars and coal plants, expand that to every single industrial practice in the united states and your solution becomes so unwieldy that it solves nothing and creates more problems. Even passively collecting information is going to become intrusive and large and you are going to create a culture of lawsuits that would basically grind business to a halt, they would be sued from every direction and would be spending more to defend themselves than actually functioning as a business.

Do you realize the scale of that idea? For cars alone you are going to have to track the use, mileage, depreciation of mileage over time, upkeep on all cars, modifications of the cars that affect mileage, how I drive my car, etc. Not to mention they are going to have to track every step in the chain of production, shipping, distribution, and sale of every car that pollutes, you realize the massive scale of that right? That doesn't sound like small government in the least bit, rather I think that borders on NSA level invasion of privacy. That would cost millions if not billions of dollars and manhours to implement, carry out, and upkeep. Think about your proposition, sorry that borders on the absurd.\n\nRather than having regulatory agencies with power to litigate you think we should all be able to sue people that pollute, and only when that pollution affects us. What defines affects us? You are going to have to figure out how someone died and if in the course of their life they were exposed to pollution that decreased their life span/contributed to their death. IF that is on the burden of the family, good luck having most people carry that out most are going to be too poor, lazy, or stupid to take the time to do so. Like most every other step you propose that is going to require a team of scientists to figure out the cause of death and how that was effected by pollution. IF that is on the shoulders of the government to figure out, again I challenge the idea that this is a libertarian idea at all since it would result in a massive expansion of government to track, litigate, and process all of this information. On this same topic how do we figure out who polluted and what percentage of the \"pollution pie\" they are responsible for? The individual is going to have to hire an army of statisticians and scientists to track that information and to put it into a form they can understand (since you argue I, not my attorney, will be taking them to court... a problem I will address later). How is that manageable in any way? Not only are you expecting people to pay for their own legal team or take the case to court themselves ( a laughable idea) but you are expecting them to do all the required research to argue their case. You are creating institutional barriers to litigation every step of the way. Even if that information is available from the NPA (national pollution agency, you would be creating it) you are going to require people to process the information themselves and to sift through the mountain of information for data that relates to their case as well, and you expect people to do this in their free time after working 40 hours a week? Do you assume that no one has anything to do after working all day or do you assume that people are all legal and data crunching machines that would be able to create a well crafted legal argument in their sleep?\n\nYou claim that people are going to be able to defend themselves because the law will be so simple anyone can bring a lawsuit...your system just put millions of attorneys out of business and created a business environment where every company (big or small) has to fear and prepare for countless lawsuits from everyone (remember according to you, if pollution affected you then you can sue). You basically ran businesses out of business by creating a litigious system that makes our current epoch look tame. You also just created an environment where Big company A can sue little company B for pollution, or find a plaintiff to sue through, and basically run smaller companies out of business through litigation.\n\nYou said we are going to have our own justice department? What on the earth does that mean? You seem to be creating a massive legal bureaucracy rather than simplifying things in anyway. \n\nYour statement on the libertarian ethos that you can't negatively affect anyone. Where is the line? Like I said above you are going to require people to sue every step in the chain of production for restitution of damages.\n\nSorry but your idea borders on the crazy. Instead of simplifying things your system will make it so dangerous to do business, of any kind really, that you are going to destroy private business. Your system is even more litigious than our current system and creates a toxic and fearful business environment that would do more harm than good.

You now have to (A) find an environmental/tort lawyer that is able and willing to take on company X (B) have the time to work with your attorney to get the case ready (they do much of the work but with a 40 hour work week for you, that is going to chew up a good bit of your free time) (C) you have to have the funds to pay your attorney to research the case, argue the case, argue the appeal of the case (you win they are going to appeal, you lose I assume you would want to appeal as well).\n\nThe problem is that this gets very expensive very fast.

I've repeatedly informed you that this same process is occurring today in many countries abroad. This is not just a historical example from America.

I've found that when people purposefully identify themselves as socialists, they are making a stark distinction between that and liberalism. \n\nAnyway, the libertarian judicial system is not the same as the system we currently have. First, there would be less, simpler laws. We wouldn't need a thousand different laws that say \"don't fuck this guy over\". We'd have one law that said it. It also reduces and can eliminate many of the loop holes defense attorney's rely on now to win their case. Most of the time it's not that they proved their client didn't do something wrong, they just got away based on a technicality. That's an important factor that needs to be addressed. There's also a justified worry that a private citizen would never be able to afford to bring a law suit to a large company or corporation, and so the free market would just run wild. That's also addressed in a libertarian judicial system. Since one of the very few roles of government we believe in is protecting citizens from those who have caused them harm, the victim would be represented by the government. Like a public defender, but with the resources of the DoJ. This puts private citizens on par with big companies, putting one giant up against another. In the case of real, monetary damages, strong property rights will trump federal regulation every time.\n\nBut you mention a good point that not all pollution can be quantified by a monetary damage. The difference here is between compensation vs restitution. You sue the company that dumps garbage on your land for compensation for the actual monetary damage done. It covers your losses. But in the case of air pollution for example, where you might not have incurred a monetary injury, you would still sue for restitution. This is in place precisely to punish the offending polluter. They've committed an act of aggression against you by putting pollutants in the air you breathe against your will. Theft is still theft, whether its stealing a nickel or a $100. And aggression is still aggression whether they put bad shit in the air or break your leg. So pretend you're a company in the middle of a neighborhood pumping all sorts of nasty chemicals in the air. Every single person in that neighborhood has a claim against you, both for compensation and restitution, and their case is represented by the government. Every time you do this, they have a new claim against you. They continue to sue, they continue to win. Your prices skyrocket. Either you need to charge more, in which case you'll lose so many customers you go out of business, or you innovate your energy system so it doesn't cause the reason you're being sued. But you won't be able to maintain the model of polluting all you want and continuing to pay the victims without having to alter anything. It's completely unsustainable. \n\nLook, it's never going to happen. So debating this too much and too passionately is going to be a waste of time pretty soon. I happen to think that an entire population with the prosecution powers of the Department of Justice threatening to sue a polluter has a lot more teeth, than just implementing a fine if they pollute more than the law says they can. I think it hits them a lot harder where it hurts, and much more often. But yes, it largely depends on a huge change with our judicial system.

They had inspections and threat of penalties. They didn't stop anything. You know what got their ass in gear? Being sued.

I'm positive they would make changes, but let's assume they don't. The first question is, what are your losses in this scenario? Health issues? Property value decreased? Let's assume it's something measurable. And let's also assume that since it's so bad that it's measurable, you're not the only one having this issue. It's affecting the entire area. The problem now lies in determining who is the source of all this pollution? The courts will have information on all car's emission, and the same with factories. So instead of tracking down individual offenders, you go after the maker. Which leads us to your third point.\n\nAgain, we're using the justice system as it stands today, rather than the one libertarians propose. Yeah, it wouldn't really work now because it's so incredibly expensive. No one would be able to afford a good lawyer, so companies would just go nuts over pollution. What's stopping them? The are two big differences in a libertarian society. 1, the laws are much simpler. To the point that you can and should be able to defend/prosecute for yourself. 2. That even if you can't prosecute or defend yourself, it's a tenet that you're protected against injuries. The government is your lawyer. You have your own Justice Department. Lawyers will still exist, but mostly for the purposes of defense. And again, the law is really on your side. Libertarians are unflinching in their belief that you can't negatively affect someone else. Even a little.  \n\nFinally, (you're straw-maning again) passing a law that says don't pollute doesn't work.

I'm positive they would make changes, but let's assume they don't. The first question is, what are your losses in this scenario? Health issues? Property value decreased? Let's assume it's something measurable. And let's also assume that since it's so bad that it's measurable, you're not the only one having this issue. It's affecting the entire area. The problem now lies in determining who is the source of all this pollution? The courts will have information on all car's emission, and the same with factories. So instead of tracking down individual offenders, you go after the maker.\n\nThat doesn't address my point at all, which was that it is impractical to parse out *which polluters* caused the losses in question. You can have all the information you want about different cars' emission rates, but in any given lawsuit, how could the plaintiff possibly prove that he developed lung cancer (or whatever) because of the Mercury Sable as opposed to the Toyota Camry, the Dodge Ram, or the brother-in-law who smokes? Realistically, *all* of those pollutants, along with hundreds more, were present and probably each contributed some small effect. The harm also probably took place gradually, over a long period of time, which means lots of the polluters might no longer exist by the time the damage is noticed. How, then, could a plaintiff possibly prove the liability of any specific defendant? And, by extension, if the plaintiff cannot possibly prove definitively who caused the harm in question, what incentive do any of the polluters have to make changes? And remember, these are not artificial parameters I'm imagining or \"straw manning\" -- this is simply the nature of the problem you say you have a better solution to.\n\n&gt; Again, we're using the justice system as it stands today, rather than the one libertarians propose. Yeah, it wouldn't really work now because it's so incredibly expensive. No one would be able to afford a good lawyer, so companies would just go nuts over pollution. What's stopping them? The are two big differences in a libertarian society. 1, the laws are much simpler. To the point that you can and should be able to defend/prosecute for yourself. 2. That even if you can't prosecute or defend yourself, it's a tenet that you're protected against injuries. The government is your lawyer. You have your own Justice Department. Lawyers will still exist, but mostly for the purposes of defense. And again, the law is really on your side. Libertarians are unflinching in their belief that you can't negatively affect someone else. Even a little.\n\nNothing about your solution meets those criteria, however. It's NOT much simpler for a layman to prove whether Toyota caused his cancer rather than Chevrolet or Marlboro than it is for the government to regulate how much of certain substances can be released into the air (or whatever). It's much, much more complex -- not only legalistically, but scientifically. We simply can't trace microscopic molecules back to their source with any degree of accuracy that would hold up in court. For the government to undertake such a task -- investigating the individual path histories of microscopic windborne and waterborne molecules, for hundreds of millions of people who are affected daily by pollution, multiplies by hundreds or more pollution sources that contribute to pollution in even just a small area, and then for each, standing up in court and spending countless hours trying to prove their conclusions beyond a reasonable doubt -- would be so complex, bloated, and expensive as to undermine the entire libertarian ideology if the task were even plausible in the first place (which I don't think it is).\n\n&gt; Finally, (you're straw-maning again) \n\nI am? Libertarians don't say we should de-regulate?\n\n&gt; passing a law that says don't pollute doesn't work. We have laws now that say don't pollute, does that mean we don't have a pollution problem anymore?\n\nThe US has extremely weak anti-pollution laws, many of which were written by the polluters themselves. Other countries have better anti-pollution laws and a smaller pollution problem. Your argument is equivalent to saying that since my old, sick, three-legged donkey does a mediocre job pulling his cart, donkeys *in general* can't pull carts. In reality, I may just need a better donkey.\n\nMoreover, we still have a murder problem even though we have laws against murder. We still have a rape problem even though we have laws against rape. It is a completely unreasonable standard to suggest that a policy doesn't work unless it entirely eliminates the problem. The pollution problem *has* gotten measurably *[better](http://www.aei-ideas.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/earthday1.jpg)* since we started regulating pollution better, which would lead most rational people to conclude that the laws do work -- though we can still recognize that our current laws are not necessarily the best possible ones.\n\n&gt; If Dodge still makes the Ram in our libertarian society, exactly the way it is now being the biggest polluting vehicle on the road- they are exposing themselves to lawsuits from the entire country. I'd say that's a hell of a lot worse than the nothing the face now for making a heavily polling vehicle.\n\nThat's only true if it's actually plausible to definitively connect a given defendant's loss specifically to the Dodge Ram itself. If that connection is prohibitively difficult to parse out, then Dodge has no incentive whatsoever to change its behavior in your libertarian society.

I never assumed or said that the new agency you create would be looking for lawsuits, rather my critique rests on the passive collection of information, that would be on a massive scale.\n\nYou open up litigation to everyone, I go to my public defender and want to sue GM for pollution. The new tracking agency is going to have to figure out the pollution that comes from GM vehicles, the production of GM vehicles, shipping them, how modifications affect their pollution levels (up or down), and then compare that to every other car manufacturer because not every car around me is GM rather pollution is caused by multiple factors. Now that new agency is going to have to figure out what portion of the pollution pie is just GM's responsibility and not VW, the coal plant next door, my neighbors smoking, or just hereditary. So even their passive collection of information for just me is going to touch on every individual that I pass in my morning commute, weekend trip, and any other time I leave my house. So yes if my twin brother who has lived with my since birth sues as well they can look at my data and use similar information in the lawsuit. BUT if anyone else wants to sue they basically have to start all over again and compile all of that data all over based on a new set of information. Now multiply that by 313.9 million people, with an infinite set of unique factors to consider, how does that not border on the draconian? If you are going to rely on the individual to sue rather than a government agency you have to have quite a few lawsuits to make any form of impact on their policy, a few lawsuits won't change anything, your theory basically requires that there are tons of lawsuits brought against every car maker to have any affect. Therefore, your new agency is going to be bustling with activity collecting and compiling just the data requested, which based on the nature of pollution (a combination of contributors rather than just one) is going to be massive in scale, they have to compile information on your daily routine to make sure the guilt is properly assigned to each polluting actor. \n\nThat is just cars. Now if we take say a coal powered energy plant the scale just expanded exponentially, not only do you have people within the immediate area of the plant but also those that were along the shipping route (trucks, barges, trains all pollute), everyone near the mine (that operation isn't clean), and everyone that was affected by wind blown pollution from the plant or any other step of the process. \n\nThat was just cars and coal plants, expand that to every single industrial practice in the united states and your solution becomes so unwieldy that it solves nothing and creates more problems. Even passively collecting information is going to become intrusive and large and you are going to create a culture of lawsuits that would basically grind business to a halt, they would be sued from every direction and would be spending more to defend themselves than actually functioning as a business.

Do you realize the scale of that idea? For cars alone you are going to have to track the use, mileage, depreciation of mileage over time, upkeep on all cars, modifications of the cars that affect mileage, how I drive my car, etc. Not to mention they are going to have to track every step in the chain of production, shipping, distribution, and sale of every car that pollutes, you realize the massive scale of that right? That doesn't sound like small government in the least bit, rather I think that borders on NSA level invasion of privacy. That would cost millions if not billions of dollars and manhours to implement, carry out, and upkeep. Think about your proposition, sorry that borders on the absurd.\n\nRather than having regulatory agencies with power to litigate you think we should all be able to sue people that pollute, and only when that pollution affects us. What defines affects us? You are going to have to figure out how someone died and if in the course of their life they were exposed to pollution that decreased their life span/contributed to their death. IF that is on the burden of the family, good luck having most people carry that out most are going to be too poor, lazy, or stupid to take the time to do so. Like most every other step you propose that is going to require a team of scientists to figure out the cause of death and how that was effected by pollution. IF that is on the shoulders of the government to figure out, again I challenge the idea that this is a libertarian idea at all since it would result in a massive expansion of government to track, litigate, and process all of this information. On this same topic how do we figure out who polluted and what percentage of the \"pollution pie\" they are responsible for? The individual is going to have to hire an army of statisticians and scientists to track that information and to put it into a form they can understand (since you argue I, not my attorney, will be taking them to court... a problem I will address later). How is that manageable in any way? Not only are you expecting people to pay for their own legal team or take the case to court themselves ( a laughable idea) but you are expecting them to do all the required research to argue their case. You are creating institutional barriers to litigation every step of the way. Even if that information is available from the NPA (national pollution agency, you would be creating it) you are going to require people to process the information themselves and to sift through the mountain of information for data that relates to their case as well, and you expect people to do this in their free time after working 40 hours a week? Do you assume that no one has anything to do after working all day or do you assume that people are all legal and data crunching machines that would be able to create a well crafted legal argument in their sleep?\n\nYou claim that people are going to be able to defend themselves because the law will be so simple anyone can bring a lawsuit...your system just put millions of attorneys out of business and created a business environment where every company (big or small) has to fear and prepare for countless lawsuits from everyone (remember according to you, if pollution affected you then you can sue). You basically ran businesses out of business by creating a litigious system that makes our current epoch look tame. You also just created an environment where Big company A can sue little company B for pollution, or find a plaintiff to sue through, and basically run smaller companies out of business through litigation.\n\nYou said we are going to have our own justice department? What on the earth does that mean? You seem to be creating a massive legal bureaucracy rather than simplifying things in anyway. \n\nYour statement on the libertarian ethos that you can't negatively affect anyone. Where is the line? Like I said above you are going to require people to sue every step in the chain of production for restitution of damages.\n\nSorry but your idea borders on the crazy. Instead of simplifying things your system will make it so dangerous to do business, of any kind really, that you are going to destroy private business. Your system is even more litigious than our current system and creates a toxic and fearful business environment that would do more harm than good.

You now have to (A) find an environmental/tort lawyer that is able and willing to take on company X (B) have the time to work with your attorney to get the case ready (they do much of the work but with a 40 hour work week for you, that is going to chew up a good bit of your free time) (C) you have to have the funds to pay your attorney to research the case, argue the case, argue the appeal of the case (you win they are going to appeal, you lose I assume you would want to appeal as well).\n\nThe problem is that this gets very expensive very fast.

Some reasons are as follows:\n\nSometimes, people simply have a disparity in bargaining power.  For example, I think it's good for the gov't to institute a price floor for wages because people aren't in a position to really bargain hard for wages when they need jobs and got bills to pay.  Sure, it eliminates one's freedom to work for less (and I've argued that with a libertarian recently), but I'm ok with that.  \n\nSometimes, there's a disparity in information and expertise.  For example, to rebut /u/AuditorTux's example, people can get second opinions on a mortgage, but you're engaging in a massively complex transaction with minimal if any experience.  On the other hand the financial institution does this all day, every day, it has trained staff, and it has access to market data that an individual simply doesn't have.  Therefore, I think it's a good idea to place most of the burden of not signing a bad mortgage on the bank.  Especially, when *everyone* has to suffer the results of bad mortgages through decreased property values, vacancies, reduced local tax bases, etc.\n\nSometimes, it's worthwhile to not *have* to be an expert on everything.  I pay my damn taxes, the gov't can use it's resources to create a regulatory environment instead of requiring each person to become an expert on everything him or herself.  \n\nI hope that makes sense, or is at least good discussion fodder.

Why not simply suggest people live my the rule \"Unless you fully understand it, don't sign\".  A 30-year fixed note is rather simple - you are going to pay the same amount monthly, 360 times.  Nothing will change (sans escrow, which can be explained rather easily) and then the *only* variables are the interest rate, the purchase price and your downpayment.  That's it.  Even if you think that you might not be getting the best interest rate, you should darn well know whether your comfortable with the other two.  And if someone wants to go to something slightly more exotic, there are 15- and 12-year notes.  More monthly, but fewer overall payments.\n\nThe problem was when people get greedy and went into 5/1 ARMs thinking that in 5 years the market would be higher and they could refinance into 30-year fixed at a lower rate, as prices had been constantly increasing and rates had remained low for half-a-decade.

Ideology aside, because you'll never get a 100% consensus, the issue I take when folks from other countries ask, \"Why don't they just use our model? It works for us.\" is because implementation is completely unfeasible. It would be a fine idea *if* we had a similar size, population, demographics. But we don't. Not even close. Our infrastructure alone is astronomical. We spend on fixing traffic lights what other countries spend on health care. Most countries are the size of *one* of our 50 states. It's just way too small of a sample size to say, \"Well it works here, it *has* to work equally as well when you scale it up.\" I mean, we don't even have to look at other countries, we can see how different states handles their problems. And they're *part* of the country! And even then we don't say, it works for Texas so it must work for California. Trying to transition to that model would destroy the economy. We're already in a massive amount of debt. And that's for the system we already have. Trying to implement more government, how would you pay for it? We can tax everyone who makes over a million dollars now a year by 100% and still not have enough to pay to run the government for more than a few months. So I don't even need to get to thinking if it's a good model or a bad model to follow- because there would be no way of implementing it. \n\nBut I agree, the way we handle it now is pitiful. I'm one of the people who believe its bad *because* of over-regulation. It is based on the assumption that the government is competent. But this is the same government who invested millions in solar panels that caught on fire when exposed to the sun. So I admit I'm being biased. And I admit that the solution I favor isn't the *only* solution. That's ridiculous for anyone to say. It's also what divides half the country. As for firings, I'll maybe clarify that each state has it's own laws about firing employees. CT, for example, can fire you for any reason so long as it's not discrimination. I'd attribute it to us being awfully sue-happy, but I've never seen someone get fired for no good reason. Some of these people get fired for even legitimate reasons and they still win a big settlement in court. This is a country where people can sue cafe's because they spilled hot coffee on themselves, or thieves can sue homeowners if they injured themselves while breaking into your home.

We'll start with religions first. It's a violation of your freedom of religion if they try to force you to believe in God, or pledge your allegiance to God, or even say the word \"God\". But they're not asking any of that from you, probably because they know there are kids like you who *don't* believe in that religion, or maybe any religion, and don't want to offend you/violate that right. They require that you stand and remain quiet. So with that in mind, I don't necessarily see it as a violation of your right to worship or not worship however you please, because they're not forcing you to worship anything. \n\nNow you might be thinking, \"Well okay, but this practice doesn't have anything to do with me. I don't believe in God, and I don't feel I owe any blind allegiance to any country. Why do I need to stand for it? If I refuse to stand for it, is that not a violation of my right to freedom of expression?\" To which I would also say no. You're freedom of expression is covered by the First Amendment, which is instructions to the *government*. It essentially means they're not going to arrest you and throw you in jail for refusing to stand. *However*, places like schools, libraries, government buildings, businesses, residences, etc., *are* allowed to come up with additional rules as a condition of being in their establishment. For example, some people occasionally get kicked out of sporting events because of swearing. They'll say that they have the freedom of speech, and they can say whatever they want. And while that's true, if that particular establishment has additional rules against swearing, you need to refrain from certain speech if you want to have access to that establishment. If you don't, you're not arrested (usually!), you just can't continue to be there anymore. \n\nThe school isn't requiring you to worship anything. They're requiring you to stand quietly. They probably require you to sit quietly while class, too. And if you break those rules, you don't get arrested, you just get a detention. Which they're allowed to do, since you're a minor, and those are the terms your parents/guardians agreed to for you. Like I said, I think it's a bullshit rule. And I think it's a rather arbitrary condition to say you're only capable of being responsible for yourself once you turn 18. You sound like a respectable, intelligent young person who's capable of thinking for yourself now. Good luck with however it turns out!\n\nEdit: wording.

I disagree with a lot of things that we do, and that's what I'm being told to support... I really can't do that with a clean mind. And I don't want to say I believe in a god that I don't believe in. I respect people's beliefs as long as they don't seek to harm other people, so I really wish that the same respect would be passed along to me and other agnostics/non-believers.\n\nBut once again, thank you. :3", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ejblg", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ca0zfp3", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1368844113", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t3_1ejblg", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431120944, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ejblg", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ca0x0zb", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1368835018", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}

And Joe Lieberman didn't leave his party in the middle of his term; he lost the Democratic nomination in 2006, ran as an Independent in the general election, and then in the next Congress sat as an Independent who also caucused with the Democrats (like Bernie Sanders). Neither of those Senators technically switched mid-term, since Lieberman did it between terms (and, for most practical purposes, didn't leave the party anyway) and Sanders never switched at all.\n\nExamples of Senators who actually did switch mid-term are Jim Jeffords of Vermont (whose seat is now held by Bernie Sanders) and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. Jeffords was a Republican until 2001, when he became an Independent and began caucusing with the Democrats (this was a very big deal because the Senate was 50-50 between the two parties before he switched, so the Senate went from having a Republican majority to a Democratic majority). Specter was a Republican until 2009, when he just switched to being a Democrat entirely (which was also a big deal because it gave the Democrats a short-lived supermajority that allowed them to pass the Affordable Care Act). Both ended up not being reelected after they switched, though, since Jeffords just retired in 2006 and Specter lost the Democratic primary in 2010 when he was up for reelection.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9v3aal", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1368052144", "ups": 4, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t3_1dy04b", "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1431257631, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Two good examples are US Senators  Joe Lieberman and Bernie Sanders.

And I'm fully prepared to agree with that. But here's where my reticence comes in.  Every dollar the government *doesn't spend* is a dollar it doesn't take from the taxpayers. The proposal I've always heard that weens government subsidized programs off the government is to issue tax credits, dollar for dollar (with a cap) for donations given to a charity that handles that need. The average tax payer probably only has a couple of cents of all their taxes going towards PP. But if they choose to donate a dollar, it behooves them because they now have a $1 tax credit to claim. It benefits PP because they could potentially raise more money than they are right now. They won't lose money, if someone donates $1 to PP, the gov't doesn't spend $1 on PP. It just reduces how much the government spends on it, but they still get the same revenue. And it eases the burden (no matter how small) the government places on taxpayers who disagree with it. No one would lose services, they could only gain and have it be even more affordable. This seems so win-win. But for some reason, the government likes to raise taxes, rather than offering a credit to encourage desired actions. They even brought it up during the Supreme Court hearings for the ACA- if you want people to buy health insurance, why are you penalizing them by making them pay an additional tax, rather than offering a credit that would offset their expense?

I am being sincere, if it's a service society wants, and it's a service society can independently fund, why is the government involved in it?

PP is perhaps not \"sucking off the federal government's teet\" so badly that it couldn't survive without government money.  it just couldn't take care of nearly as many people if the government didn't put some funding in, and those people would look at the government and wonder out loud if those same kinds of services are available to them if PP didn't have the resources to provide it.  \n\nSome would see healthcare as a commodity for those who can afford it and say  \"suffer without it, ur one of the 47% that demand things from the government, and we don't have to give it to you\"\n\nsome would see it as an obligation to provide those kinds of services (A), and provide them at a higher cost with more government interference.\n\nsome would recognize the obligation to others, but be unwilling to do what's necessary to actually do it. \n\n(2) I did bring up philosophy, but only as it relates to politics.  your question was a purely philosophical one, whereas i only care about the confluence of philosophy and politics.\n\n(3) social contract theory isn't purely Socrates'.

But I don't think his interpretation supports the point you're trying to make. In fact it almost proves the opposite. But just the same, I did break it down to philosophy, because that's how politics came to be. And at some point, that's what every law is based on- some founding philosophy. As for the bible, I thought you would quote Mathew 22:15! \n\nSo I understand that it would still be able to function, but you assert just not help as many people. And I'm fully prepared to agree with that. But here's where my reticence comes in.  Every dollar the government *doesn't spend* is a dollar it doesn't take from the taxpayers. The proposal I've always heard that weens government subsidized programs off the government is to issue tax credits, dollar for dollar (with a cap) for donations given to a charity that handles that need. The average tax payer probably only has a couple of cents of all their taxes going towards PP. But if they choose to donate a dollar, it behooves them because they now have a $1 tax credit to claim. It benefits PP because they could potentially raise more money than they are right now. They won't lose money, if someone donates $1 to PP, the gov't doesn't spend $1 on PP. It just reduces how much the government spends on it, but they still get the same revenue. And it eases the burden (no matter how small) the government places on taxpayers who disagree with it. No one would lose services, they could only gain and have it be even more affordable. This seems so win-win. But for some reason, the government likes to raise taxes, rather than offering a credit to encourage desired actions. They even brought it up during the Supreme Court hearings for the ACA- if you want people to buy health insurance, why are you penalizing them by making them pay an additional tax, rather than offering a credit that would offset their expense? Why is the mentality to punish rather than reward?
