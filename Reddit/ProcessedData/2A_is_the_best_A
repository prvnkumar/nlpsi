It is possible to ban guns which have features that increase the likelihood of shooting more people quickly. \n\nGuns are not the root cause of the problem. This is very true. But they are used as tools for this problem.\n\n&gt;Loonies talking about fictional things like ghost guns and heat seeking bullets is pretty unscientific.\n\nI didn't know what a ghost gun was, so i looked it up. Here is one [NBC News](http://www.nbcnews.com/video/nightly-news/53585194#53585194)\n\nI can't speak to heat-seeking bullets because that would be a stupid idea. It's a good way to only shoot TV's and car exhausts' while spending a LOT of money on already expensive ammo.\n\n&gt;Banning based on cosmetics is not a scientific policy.\n\nNot really, banning semi-auto long guns which have a pistol grip is not really a cosmetic only thing.  A pistol grip on a long gun give the user the enhances the ability to remain upright (mobile) while targeting.  It also allows for more blowback control with rapid firing.  There is a reason the military uses guns designed like this. Semi auto long guns are also a little odd to me. Can you explain the need (serious) for a hunter to be able to fire off so many rounds quickly. Why a bolt action wouldn't work?\n\n&gt;Claiming rifles can shoot down passenger aircraft, when it's never happened, is unscientific.\n\nThat's a weird thing to claim as unscientific. By that measure, claiming it's possible to build a car in my living room would be unscientific. Just because it hasn't been done yet doesn't mean it isn't possible and unscientific.  Perhaps shooting one bullet at a passenger aircraft (even if aimed at the pilot) wouldn't bring down the plane. [Getting a few of these guys](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UieFjuPIitY) to unload at a passenger airplane as it's taking off might cause some problems.\n\n&gt;Murder rates are trending down, there have never been more guns.\nit's at the lowest rate since 2004. Not really the timescale I was looking for. But it's true none the less. But if I was going to commit a murder, my tool of choice would be a gun (70% of murders choose the gun). So that is why I am open the to argument that this tool should be regulated and restricted.  When non-legitimate (hunting and protection) uses of a certain type of gun are up it's worth looking into maybe that type of tool is causing more problems then it is solving.  In DC they said the handgun is favored by criminals because of its size. So they said guns should be large as to not give the criminal the advantage of size.  Overall this ban didn't work because people who illegally wanted handguns didn't need to drive far to get them. But then they were in possession of something illegal before a crime (which is why you would want an illegal gun anyway). This gives police a chance to intercept the shooter before hand.\n\nIn the case of Tucson. The shooter had 30round mags. He was only stopped when he tried to reload and failed.  it could be argued that if he only had 10 rounds he would have been stopped 20 rounds soonder. If the 30round clip was illegal and he wanted that clip because it is the best to commit his crime he would have done something illegal before the crime.  (as far as i know) he didn't commit a crime until he opened fire.\n\n\n&gt;Focusing great effort on small problems like massacres is highly inefficient.\nI am not sure what you mean by \"great effort\". Passing a law saying not to make these types of weapons is not really a \"great effort\". It's pretty easy actually.\n\n&gt;Background checks haven't prevented Tucson, Aurora, Columbine, Sandyhook. None of those guns passed through the \"gun show loophole\".\n\nNone the less if I was a felon and not allowed to have a gun I know that if I go to a gun show or a private seller that it would be pretty easy for me to get a gun. If background checks were implemented then as a felon I would try to buy guns from less legal means. That means that I would then have to buy a gun from a someone who could be an undercover cop maybe? It makes it harder to get.  This is a separate issue from the massacres because those were lone gunman who really didn't have a criminal background, they just wanted to die.

As a country we have bans already about the style and capability of a weapon. An addition to these bans (Full auto, shotgun length, saturday night specials) isn't on the level of scientific disagreement.\n\nBoth sides use figures they find supporting their case.\nAnother quote from the factcheck.org article: \"While Lott\u2019s work is often cited by gun rights advocates, his findings are strongly disputed by numerous academics\".  They are both guilty (maybe one more than the other).\n\nOthers have downvoted gun comments because like me they think it is a ideological issue and not a scientifically set issue.\n\nIf you'd like to discuss it more I am more than happy to.  The restrictions that were being pushed; ban on military style weapons, a limit on magazine capacity, and background check for all sales, didn't rub me the wrong way.  These weren't really to stop all gun crimes but rather the mass shootings of late. A lot of them using the popular AR-15.  So it makes sense, to me at least, to ban the type/style of weapons that were most popular in these shootings. The shooters chose these weapon for a reason.  It's obvious to me why, it's a pretty good gun for for being able to shoot off a lot of rounds in a short period of time.  Is a hunter going to need to fire more than 5 shots in a short period of time? I don't really think so (but I am not a hunter, I only imagine that you really have 1 or 2 shots then the prey runs away). For self defense do you need more than 5 shots? If you're being attacked by 6 people... I am not sure how often this happens when someone needs so many rounds.  I would imagine (without really looking it up) that more people have died because the attacker had 30+ rounds to shoot off in a short time than would be saved because there were 6 attackers. I know there are cases (specifically with the gifford shooting and newtown shooting) where lives were saved because the attacker had to reload.  So to me putting a ban on the weapons that enable a lot of quick shooting and magazines which hold so many rounds seems like a good way of lowering the kill count.  Background checks for everyone is pretty self explanatory.\n\nThere are other laws, like DC's handgun ban, which make sense too as handguns are much more likely to be used in a homicide. They are easily transported and hidden. Long guns are not. A long gun works pretty well in home defense and hunting. Handguns are good for home defense and favored for homicide.    \n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1vdzos", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cexf8oe", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1390533624", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_cewq7i2", "parent_id": "t1_cerj962", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1432068691, "controversiality": 0, "body": "The ideological difference on gun control stems from rank ignorance and fantasy on the left.\n\nIt's quite comparable to believing in creation, except the anti gun fantasies can be proven wrong by fact checking.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1vdzos", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cewq7i2", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1390469090", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "malparc", "id": "t1_cerj962", "parent_id": "t1_cergknm", "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1431976568, "controversiality": 0, "body": "those are ideological differences not something that is regarded by the scientific community (or other academic community as a whole)  as wrong.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1vdzos", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cerj962", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1389922671", "distinguished": null, "ups": 4}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1vdzos", "selftext": "yeah... fiscal policy... about that, you're allowed to have your own opinions, not your own facts.  bush left with the dow at 8K, obama &amp; bernanke (mostly bernanke) brought it back to 16,000.  not to mention, the people who were able to weather the housing crisis are now (mostly) above water, the housing market is up 30%+ since 2009.  the predictions of doom and gloom haven't happened, and it's been 5 years since obama took office  \n\nand the stimulus they gave out before ended up helping the economy.  heck, most of the money they put into the banks was all repaid, and US taxpayers actually made money on almost all those investments.\n\nthe GOP is going to need to work with their opponents for the good of america.  somehow, they've convinced theirselves america is completely broke, despite that we're worth 77 trillion, and have debt of 17 trillion.  those numbers are manageable, even if they aren't optimal.

I wasn't arguing one side or the other, I was merely presenting the sides.\n\nETA: I'm also familiar with what Scalia says.  I disagree that he addresses the point.  He brushes off the militia clause as being explanatory as to why such a right *might* exist and not contextual to *when* such a right exists.  Scalia's interpretation makes the clause unnecessary, yet Chief Justice Marshall wrote that \"it cannot be presumed that any clause in the constitution is intended to be without effect.\"  Is there any other enumeration in the Constitution or Bill of Rights where something is written superfluously?", "edited": 1387137300, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1stm9x", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ce2ekvu", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1387136156", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_ce1v5fh", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428130176, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1stm9x", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ce1xpci", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1387072562", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_ce1fczl", "score": -1, "retrieved_on": 1428131499, "controversiality": 0, "body": "There were two minority opinions - Stevens and Breyer - both of which were joined by each other and Ginsburg and Souter in-tow.  I mentioned this in my response **as a footnote** only because *Heller* was a 5-4 decision, meaning it is one that may easily be changed in a relatively short timeframe (10 years or so).  And remember, this was only decided in 2008, so it's not like it's long-standing precedent either. Here's a lengthy excerpt from the Stevens dissent regarding the militia thing (and I disagree with the point it has been \"thoroughly\" debunked as BS as Stevens makes a good argument IMO):\n\n&gt;The text of the Second Amendment is brief. It provides: \u201cA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear \nArms, shall not be infringed.\u201d\n\n&gt;Three portions of that text merit special focus: the in\u00adtroductory language defining the Amendment\u2019s purpose, the class of persons encompassed within its reach, and the unitary nature of the right that it protects. \n\n&gt;&gt;\u201cA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of \na free State.\u201d  \n\n&gt;The preamble to the Second Amendment makes three important points. It identifies the preservation of the militia as the Amendment\u2019s purpose; it explains that the militia is necessary to the security of a free State; and it recognizes that the militia must be \u201cwell regulated.\u201d In all three respects it is comparable to provisions in several State Declarations of Rights that were adopted roughly contemporaneously with the Declaration of Independence.  Those state provisions highlight the importance members of the founding generation attached to the maintenance of state militias; they also underscore the profound fear shared by many in that era of the dangers posed by stand\u00ading armies. While the need for state militias has not been a matter of significant public interest for almost two centuries, that fact should not obscure the contemporary concerns that animated the Framers.\n\n&gt;The parallels between the Second Amendment and these state declarations, and the Second Amendment\u2019s omission of any statement of purpose related to the right to use firearms for hunting or personal self-defense, is especially striking in light of the fact that the Declarations of Rights of Pennsylvania and Vermont did expressly protect such civilian uses at the time. Article XIII of Pennsylvania\u2019s 1776 Declaration of Rights announced that \u201cthe people have a right to bear arms for the defence *of themselves* and the state,\u201d 1 Schwartz 266 (emphasis added); \u00a743 of the Declaration assured that \u201cthe inhabi\u00adtants of this state shall have the liberty to fowl and hunt in seasonable times on the lands they hold, and on all other lands therein not inclosed,\u201d id., at 274. And Article XV of the 1777 Vermont Declaration of Rights guaranteed \u201c[t]hat the people have a right to bear arms for the defence *of themselves* and the State.\u201d Id., at 324 (emphasis added). The contrast between those two declarations and the Second Amendment reinforces the clear statement of purpose announced in the Amendment\u2019s preamble. It confirms that the Framers\u2019 single-minded focus in crafting the constitutional guarantee \u201cto keep and bear arms\u201d was on military uses of firearms, which they viewed in the context of service in state militias. \n\n&gt;The preamble thus both sets forth the object of the Amendment and informs the meaning of the remainder of its text. Such text should not be treated as mere surplu\u00adsage, for \u201c[i]t cannot be presumed that any clause in the constitution is intended to be without effect.\u201d Marbury v.

The courts only define this expectation in the immediate vicinity of your dwelling (like 20'). Cops use this to go on your property to look for pot farms without warrants. Since they aren't right up against your house, you have no expectation of privacy, and thus there is no trespass. \n\nIt's sort of a weird framework, but that's how and why the US is different than most places.

Because such claims invade a special province of the Executive -- its prosecutorial discretion -- we have emphasized that the standard for proving them is particularly demanding, requiring a criminal defendant to introduce \u201cclear evidence\u201d displacing the presumption that a prosecutor has acted lawfully. United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 463-465, 116 S.Ct. 1480, 134 L.Ed.2d 687 (1996). We have said: \u201cThis broad discretion [afforded the Executive] rests largely on the recognition that the decision to prosecute is particularly ill-suited to judicial review. Such factors as the strength of the case, the prosecution's general deterrence value, the Government's enforcement priorities, and the case's relationship to the Government's overall enforcement plan are not readily susceptible to the kind of analysis the courts are competent to undertake. Judicial supervision in this area, moreover, entails systemic costs of particular concern. Examining the basis of a prosecution delays the criminal proceeding, threatens to chill law enforcement by subjecting the prosecutor's motives and decisionmaking to outside inquiry, and may undermine prosecutorial effectiveness by revealing the Government's enforcement policy. All of these are substantial concerns that make the courts properly hesitant to examine the decision whether to prosecute.\u201d Wayte v.

Basically, because there is no one to take care of the \"domestic duties\" (such as childcare, cooking, etc) these all get outsourced.  Instead of one spouse (doesn't have to be a woman) taking $5 of groceries and preparing a meal, the family stops by and grabs a $10 meal each.  Then add in a second car, gas, another wardrobe (work and home for both spouses) and it starts to add up quickly.

My take originally was that you can't be sure of the causality.  Dual earning incomes could also have become necessity to make up for stagnant middle class earnings.  Or it could have been a feedback loop: more double income earners drove up prices, requiring more double income earners, etc etc.\n\nThe most convincing argument for lack of mobility that I've heard was the increasing investment cost in staying in the middle class (which may have increased because of chicks out of the kitchen!): education is more and more expensive. I also can't find the article now, but in 1960s the average college education was less than half the median yearly wage, and now it's about the same or a little more; a parent has to work more than a whole year for one child's college, which no longer guarantees upward mobility.  Decades ago sending a child to college meant they would earn more than you did, now it keeps them in the same group.  \n\nWe can be pretty sure it's a lot of factors, possibly all of these, but we the clearest international trend is this: mobility is negatively correlation to income inequality.

The line saying we must pay our debt was really just part of the thing saying we're never going to pay for the Confederacy's debts, but we'll still pay those still outstanding from before the civil war that were originally incurred by the US. A sane Supreme Court would just throw the debt service requirement out based on the context, IMO.

That's a pretty solid recipe for no negotiations.\n\nIt should be noted that even when there are no guns being waved around, it's still extremely hard for Obama and the GOP to negotiate because the GOP absolutely refuses to give an inch on revenue, no matter how much in entitlement cuts Obama offers (the fiscal cliff deal only raised taxes because they were expiring anyway, so it was really a tax that was agreed to by both sides). Not a fucking penny. Now more revenue is not all that Democrats would like, but taking that off the table eliminates a lot of possible deals.

There were weeks of negotiations with Boehner, Cantor, and McConnell. By all accounts Boehner broke up the talks because of pressure from his conservative members, while Cantor was positioning himself as the conservative choice for Speaker should Boehner be turned on. \n\nThere were negotiations over the fiscal cliff deal earlier this year.

There were weeks of negotiations with Boehner, Cantor, and McConnell. By all accounts Boehner broke up the talks because of pressure from his conservative members, while Cantor was positioning himself as the conservative choice for Speaker should Boehner be turned on. \n\nThere were negotiations over the fiscal cliff deal earlier this year.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;Except you ignore externalities as well as the side-effects of a free market. If government gets too small both these can hamper the efficiency of the nation. After all, efficiency is using the least resources to get the most benefit, and sometimes that needs a strong government. \n\nI'm not ignoring them, they're just often external to government. I also didn't say a government should have zero size. \n\n&gt;For example, I'm sure you agree that anti-monopoly legislation is good yes? Monopoly is a natural result of an unregulated market but once established makes the market much less efficient. \n\nI've studied free market issues relating to monopolies for a solid decade in the past, across several disciplines (strategy, ethics, etc). Monopolies are not a consequence of a free market, rather they are the consequence of market distortion a like barriers to entry. A monopoly can't exist in a free market (by definition). \n\nAfter all of that study (and more papers written about it than I can bear to remember), the only conclusion that I've come to that sticks is:\n*The only way a free market works is if everybody is trying to cheat, but nobody gets away with it.*\n\nIf you're not trying to cheat you're not being innovative. If you get away with it you're a monopoly. So you have to cheat, but not get away with it. \n\nThe government role is in making sure nobody gets away with it. However, this doesn't look a lot like current regulations in a lot of cases. This would mean government would prevent intellectual property protections, out trade secrets, etc (as these are barriers to entry and market distortions). \n\n&gt;Or Healthcare, the US has shown rather conclusively that a private system costs more resources for the same outcome. The US spends double what Canada does and is less healthy. That also doesn't count those who would go bankrupt paying medical bills, when their money could be used elsewhere in the economy. So while Canada's government is larger than the US's, I would also argue that it is more efficient.\n\nThe healthcare market is massively distorted in its current state. Obamacare doesn't do much to solve the real problems. But I don't see it as government's role. I see a large contributing factor here the cultural misnomer that you're gonna live forever, which leads to extraordinary end of life care costs... with little benefit to anyone.\n\nThere's no reason that solutions to this problem have to involve the government, like in the monopoly case, above. \n\n&gt;There is also the matter of what to do with the poor. Ignore them and you will have civil unrest. Poverty also has a high retention rate, it is much easier to fall into poverty than it is to get out again. So you will have wasted resources in a segment of the population unable to take steps to advance themselves (and therefore the whole economy) in the long term because their entire energy is focused on short term survival.\n\nCall me a hard ass, but in very few situations do I see the poor as a government's problem. I help the poor quite a bit... personally, with no help from the government. This is a model that is being replaced with inefficient government programs. \n\n&gt;Social saftey nets aren't just popular, they are economically important. They prevent civil unrest, which is a drain on the economy. They allow for job retraining and advanced education in a way the free market wouldn't afford the poor. It creates millions of customers, inducing demand as very little of a social safety net goes to savings. It's benefits far outweigh its costs, ROI of programs like food stamps and headstart are upwards of 500% making them an efficient use of resources. \n\nWhat you've done there is connected economic output with the goal of the government. This is not the role I think government should play. They should enforce free markets and let the economic output be determined by those in the market. \n\nCommunism says \"work hard for the good of the country\" (meaning the ruling class, really). But capitalism says \"be free to work as much or as little as suits how you want to live.\" \n\nPersonally, I don't want to be as rich as possible. I do pretty well, but I could certainly work harder and earn a lot more money. But I'd rather have time to spend with my family and raising my children. Those are non-economic goods (b/c my valuation of that isn't the same as yours). In a socialist society you are not free to make those decisions, which lie outside of the realm of economics. It takes free markets to have freedom outside of the economy.

Monopoly is a natural result of an unregulated market but once established makes the market much less efficient. \n\nI've studied free market issues relating to monopolies for a solid decade in the past, across several disciplines (strategy, ethics, etc). Monopolies are not a consequence of a free market, rather they are the consequence of market distortion a like barriers to entry. A monopoly can't exist in a free market (by definition). \n\nAfter all of that study (and more papers written about it than I can bear to remember), the only conclusion that I've come to that sticks is:\n*The only way a free market works is if everybody is trying to cheat, but nobody gets away with it.*\n\nIf you're not trying to cheat you're not being innovative. If you get away with it you're a monopoly. So you have to cheat, but not get away with it. \n\nThe government role is in making sure nobody gets away with it. However, this doesn't look a lot like current regulations in a lot of cases. This would mean government would prevent intellectual property protections, out trade secrets, etc (as these are barriers to entry and market distortions). \n\n&gt;Or Healthcare, the US has shown rather conclusively that a private system costs more resources for the same outcome.

I see a large contributing factor here the cultural misnomer that you're gonna live forever, which leads to extraordinary end of life care costs... with little benefit to anyone.\n\nThere's no reason that solutions to this problem have to involve the government, like in the monopoly case, above. \n\n&gt;There is also the matter of what to do with the poor.

I help the poor quite a bit... personally, with no help from the government. This is a model that is being replaced with inefficient government programs. \n\n&gt;Social saftey nets aren't just popular, they are economically important. They prevent civil unrest, which is a drain on the economy. They allow for job retraining and advanced education in a way the free market wouldn't afford the poor.

They should enforce free markets and let the economic output be determined by those in the market. \n\nCommunism says \"work hard for the good of the country\" (meaning the ruling class, really). But capitalism says \"be free to work as much or as little as suits how you want to live.\" \n\nPersonally, I don't want to be as rich as possible. I do pretty well, but I could certainly work harder and earn a lot more money. But I'd rather have time to spend with my family and raising my children. Those are non-economic goods (b/c my valuation of that isn't the same as yours). In a socialist society you are not free to make those decisions, which lie outside of the realm of economics.

It's also generally the result of personal choice as well (and sometimes a lot of work and or money is required... in fact, that's far more common than you would think).\n\nYou seem to think a child is some liability, but having and raising a child is a life experience completely different than anything else, and so defies any sort of classification like that.\n\nI have 2 kids now, and while they're certainly the most expensive thing I've ever done, and certainly the most inconvenient thing that has ever happened to me, raising them has also been the most gratifying, fun, and rewarding thing I've ever done.\n\nFor me to feel entitled to all you list just for having kids is the most incongruous thing I could possibly think of.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the traditional view of children has changed in recent times in Western cultures. Originally, kids were your investment and retirement plan. In many places in the world this is still true. Now, they are treated as some big liability or limit to your freedom, which is a complete 180. Before the last century, the idea was ridiculous that a child was anything other than the most badass free thing that takes care of you when you get old.\n\nOne of the most interesting things I've read recently was a comparison of ancient values of children vs what we see today. At one time children were regularly sacrificed to bring favor and prosperity on a family (immolation, etc). In valuing a child as you do above, as a liability or a limit on freedom, how is that different from sacrificing children in ancient times? The only difference is that in modern times it's easier to quantify a monetary gain from not having a child. However, that valuation doesn't change the moral issue here, in that a child is being viewed as basically money, and can be traded away as such.\n\nSo, to answer your final question, the ~~right~~ *pro-life* groups don't advocate those programs because they are treating children (which are human beings the same as you or I) as a simple monetary object or property.\n\nThere will never be any accurate monetary valuation of any human life of any kind, in my opinion.

Pp. 2\u201353.\n&gt;        (a) The Amendment\u2019s prefatory clause announces a purpose, but does not limit or expand the scope of the second part, the operative clause. The operative clause\u2019s text and history demonstrate that it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms. Pp. 2\u201322.\n&gt;        (b) The prefatory clause comports with the Court\u2019s interpretation of the operative clause. The \u201cmilitia\u201d comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens\u2019 militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule. The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens\u2019 militia would be preserved. Pp. 22\u201328.\n&gt;        (c) The Court\u2019s interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately followed the Second Amendment. Pp. 28\u201330.\n&gt;        (d) The Second Amendment\u2019s drafting history, while of dubious interpretive worth, reveals three state Second Amendment proposals that unequivocally referred to an individual right to bear arms. Pp. 30\u201332.\n&gt;        (e) Interpretation of the Second Amendment by scholars, courts and legislators, from immediately after its ratification through the late 19th century also supports the Court\u2019s conclusion. Pp. 32\u201347.\n&gt;        (f) None of the Court\u2019s precedents forecloses the Court\u2019s interpretation. Neither United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542 , nor Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252 , refutes the individual-rights interpretation. United States v. Miller, 307 U. S. 174 , does not limit the right to keep and bear arms to militia purposes, but rather limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by the militia, i.e., those in common use for lawful purposes.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;if it's a bad source, then don't use it. if you're admitting its not a good source, i won't bother to read or respond to it. your source isn't very strong, and i don't feel like responding to the pro-gun folk.\n\nI didn't say it was bad, but not the best. There was a great quote I read recently that I was wishing I could link to where the Chicago guys are specifically saying they intend to limit the 2A with the use of taxes. The source cited is not the best in that it isn't what I had in mind. However, it is actually a pretty good source when discussing the Racist implications of gun control laws of the past and present, which addresses the Jim Crow comments directly. In that way, it is an excellent source. I see nothing to dispute it's holding of previous gun control policy intended directly to have the same effect as Jim Crow laws.\n\nAs for fees/etc, the only infringing I see is when it directly relates to the \"keep and bear\" portion of the 2A, which doesn't include the original purchase of the gun.\n\nThat is not to say that I don't see infringement happening. I do, but I just don't see a constitutional basis against it as a tax as I do with the \"keep and bear\" stuff. \n\nDisenfranchisement is not relevant here, just infringement. State interests are relevant here, but only in the sense that it fits within federal authority, as in a tax. SCOTUS has held repeatedly that congress can impose taxes to limit undesirable behavior (probably most recently in the Obamacare decision). If the government can state that gun *sales* (background checks or sale taxes) or *manufacturing* (federal excise tax) are undesirable, there's nothing to stop them from taxing that.\n\nHowever, gun *ownership* is specifically protected against in the 2A. Passing a gun tax where you had to pay per gun (once or yearly) would be thrown out in court in a heartbeat. Stating that you have to have a license to posses a gun (and then a yearly fee on a license) is on extremely shaky ground, and I don't think will hold up in court much longer in the future. This goes way beyond what the court has upheld (requiring a license for concealed carry, as this goes beyond the home), and I know of no decision upholding such.\n\nAs for the mentally ill, it seems this restriction has not been decided by the SCOTUS. Heller, in the long explanation states:\n&gt;Although *we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment*, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or\nlaws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws impos\u00ading conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. [26]\n\nAnd note 26:\n\n&gt;We identify these presumptively lawful regulatory measures only as examples; our list does not purport to be exhaustive.\n\nWhat they are doing is punting on this one, as is required as this was not addressed in the case at hand. They are saying that the existing prohibitions are to be presumed lawful until specifically addressed.\n\nFrom this, I can't completely agree with you that the reason for the existence of these existing restrictions is due to a \"controlling state interest\", and that any other such state interests can be used to justify any other restrictions.\n\nAs to this balance between state interests and a constitutionally guaranteed right, the Heller decision states (including comparisons to the 1A):\n&gt; We know of no other enumerated constitutional right whose core protection has been subjected to a freestanding \u201cinterest-balancing\u201d approach. The very enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government\u2014even the Third Branch of Government\u2014the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth insist\u00ading upon. A constitutional guarantee subject to future judges\u2019 assessments of its usefulness is no constitutional guarantee at all. \n&gt;Constitutional rights are enshrined with the scope they were understood to have when the people adopted them, whether or not future legislatures or (yes) even future judges think that scope too broad. We would not apply an \u201cinterest-balancing\u201d approach to the prohibi\u00adtion of a peaceful neo-Nazi march through Skokie. See National Socialist Party of America v. Skokie, 432 U. S. 43 (1977) (per curiam). The First Amendment contains the freedom-of-speech guarantee that the people ratified, which included exceptions for obscenity, libel, and disclo\u00adsure of state secrets, but not for the expression of ex\u00adtremely unpopular and wrong-headed views. The Second Amendment is no different. Like the First, it is the very product of an interest-balancing by the people\u2014which JUSTICE BREYER would now conduct for them anew. And whatever else it leaves to future evaluation, it surely elevates above all other interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.\n\nSo what he is saying here is that legal restrictions on the 2A right are those that are understood to have existed when the 2A was ratified. When it was ratified, it was subject to this \"state interest\" balance, but only to the extent of the state interest that existed at that time. Redefining the state interest today should not alter the scope of the restrictions placed on the right in the name of such state interests. The restrictions are constant, short of constitutional amendment, in effect.\n\nNow, lets look at these restrictions you mention in light of this.\n\n1. The limit of shouting \"fire\" in a theater still applies, as it was understood to be so restricted at ratification.\n\n2. Registration of arms should not apply, as it was not understood at the time. In fact, arms didn't even have serial numbers at the time, so any concept of registration could not have been imaginable to those who ratified the 2A. As such, a registration requirement is an infringement.\n\n3. Background checks on sales. Infringement or not doesn't matter. Fed's have been granted the power to regulate interstate commerce, and states their own commerce. Requiring a fee for this is a tax, and also a granted power. [**NOTE:** However, that the Federal gov doesn't have jurisdiction to force background checks for sales that don't cross state lines or involve federally licensed parties. A state does. This matters as to the implementation of background checks only, but the power has been granted to one form of government or the other, and is not reserved to individuals]. [**NOTE2:** I'm not sure the commerce clause will apply the same to non-sale transfers, such as inheriting a weapon].\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1ce4q9", "selftext": "ummm... when the constitution was written, Americans had a 4th amendment right to be secure in their property which of course included the constitutionally gauranteed right to own other human beings (african slaves)....\n\nand even when you couldn't own them, SCOTUS said they weren't citizens.\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "And that was the shitty law of the time, and the SCOTUS confirmed that.

So no laws have been passed saying that you shouldn't have to pay to purchase, use, or keep a firearm. \n\nYou're incorrect, this has been done in the past ([source](http://www.conservapedia.com/Gun_control) (not the best souce, but I don't save current politician quotes from recent articles, but esp. in Chicago this is exactly their stated intent)):\n&gt; After the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1878, most States turned to \"facially neutral\" business or transaction taxes on handgun purchases. However, the intention of these laws was not neutral. An article in Virginia's official university law review called for a \"prohibitive tax...on the privilege\" of selling handguns as a way of disarming \"the son of Ham,\" whose \"cowardly practice of 'toting' guns has been one of the most fruitful sources of crime.... Let a negro board a railroad train with a quart of mean whiskey and a pistol in his grip and the chances are that there will be a murder, or at least a row, before he alights.\"[33] Thus, many Southern States imposed high taxes or banned inexpensive guns so as to price blacks and poor whites out of the gun market. \n\nIt's worth noting that infringements must be on the \"right to keep and bear\" arms. This means ownership, and lawful use, at least (it probably means in public, but hasn't been interpreted yet, however McDonald points that the concealed carry ban of IL is an infringement, so it's probably safe to assume). \n\nThe 2A doesn't say \"the right to purchase a gun shall not be infringed\". \n\nIn light of the IL's laws, they are clearly infringements on both. \n\nFirst, in most jurisdictions there you have to pay a tax to simply own (\"keep\" a gun, via the registration system and $100/3yr fee). This is clearly an infringement on keeping the arm. \n\nSecond, the concealed carry ban was ruled unconstitutional as it's an infringement on \"bearing\" arms.\n\n&gt; the premise of your argument isn't very strong either, why don't u try comparing gun costs to other, more closely related ideas, such as car/motorycle ownership/use.\n\nI don't think comparing costs is required here. Does the tax apply to the protected acts listed in the 2A? That's the only question that needs to be asked.

V. Heller)\n\nthe need to regulate firearms in order to effectively prohibit \"the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill\" and to ensure the \"laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms\" is \"longstanding\" and a controlling state interest. now, along with that comes with fees. those are inevitable and as long as not so much to be considered \"egregious\" are simply part of doing business. and even if they were, they have a \"controlling state interest\" that precludes it from being disenfranchisment.\"\n\n*note my definition of disenfranchisment doesn't stray far from it in the legal kind of sense, not the libertarian-esque argument that you could chase down the rabbit hole and end up with arguments such as:\n\nfor example, you could say that the government's disenfranchising poor people by forcing them to purchase airbags, seat belts, and traction control in cars because it pushes the price of them up and out of reach of the poor. \n\n*also of note this was only used to make the comparison between the concepts of \"controlling state interests\" with regards to voter IDs and gun ownership.  the point was that DC v Heller allows registration and the subsequent paying of fees when it says what i quoted above, whereas voter ID laws need to show that there was some sort of statistically measurable fraud or public confidence loss in the voting process in order to justify the steamrolling of rights.\n\nas Scalia said in DC.

There was a great quote I read recently that I was wishing I could link to where the Chicago guys are specifically saying they intend to limit the 2A with the use of taxes. The source cited is not the best in that it isn't what I had in mind. However, it is actually a pretty good source when discussing the Racist implications of gun control laws of the past and present, which addresses the Jim Crow comments directly. In that way, it is an excellent source. I see nothing to dispute it's holding of previous gun control policy intended directly to have the same effect as Jim Crow laws.\n\nAs for fees/etc, the only infringing I see is when it directly relates to the \"keep and bear\" portion of the 2A, which doesn't include the original purchase of the gun.\n\nThat is not to say that I don't see infringement happening. I do, but I just don't see a constitutional basis against it as a tax as I do with the \"keep and bear\" stuff. \n\nDisenfranchisement is not relevant here, just infringement. State interests are relevant here, but only in the sense that it fits within federal authority, as in a tax. SCOTUS has held repeatedly that congress can impose taxes to limit undesirable behavior (probably most recently in the Obamacare decision). If the government can state that gun *sales* (background checks or sale taxes) or *manufacturing* (federal excise tax) are undesirable, there's nothing to stop them from taxing that.\n\nHowever, gun *ownership* is specifically protected against in the 2A. Passing a gun tax where you had to pay per gun (once or yearly) would be thrown out in court in a heartbeat. Stating that you have to have a license to posses a gun (and then a yearly fee on a license) is on extremely shaky ground, and I don't think will hold up in court much longer in the future. This goes way beyond what the court has upheld (requiring a license for concealed carry, as this goes beyond the home), and I know of no decision upholding such.\n\nAs for the mentally ill, it seems this restriction has not been decided by the SCOTUS. Heller, in the long explanation states:\n&gt;Although *we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment*, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or\nlaws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws impos\u00ading conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. [26]\n\nAnd note 26:\n\n&gt;We identify these presumptively lawful regulatory measures only as examples; our list does not purport to be exhaustive.\n\nWhat they are doing is punting on this one, as is required as this was not addressed in the case at hand. They are saying that the existing prohibitions are to be presumed lawful until specifically addressed.\n\nFrom this, I can't completely agree with you that the reason for the existence of these existing restrictions is due to a \"controlling state interest\", and that any other such state interests can be used to justify any other restrictions.\n\nAs to this balance between state interests and a constitutionally guaranteed right, the Heller decision states (including comparisons to the 1A):\n&gt; We know of no other enumerated constitutional right whose core protection has been subjected to a freestanding \u201cinterest-balancing\u201d approach. The very enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government\u2014even the Third Branch of Government\u2014the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth insist\u00ading upon. A constitutional guarantee subject to future judges\u2019 assessments of its usefulness is no constitutional guarantee at all. \n&gt;Constitutional rights are enshrined with the scope they were understood to have when the people adopted them, whether or not future legislatures or (yes) even future judges think that scope too broad. We would not apply an \u201cinterest-balancing\u201d approach to the prohibi\u00adtion of a peaceful neo-Nazi march through Skokie. See National Socialist Party of America v. Skokie, 432 U. S. 43 (1977) (per curiam). The First Amendment contains the freedom-of-speech guarantee that the people ratified, which included exceptions for obscenity, libel, and disclo\u00adsure of state secrets, but not for the expression of ex\u00adtremely unpopular and wrong-headed views. The Second Amendment is no different. Like the First, it is the very product of an interest-balancing by the people\u2014which JUSTICE BREYER would now conduct for them anew. And whatever else it leaves to future evaluation, it surely elevates above all other interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.\n\nSo what he is saying here is that legal restrictions on the 2A right are those that are understood to have existed when the 2A was ratified. When it was ratified, it was subject to this \"state interest\" balance, but only to the extent of the state interest that existed at that time. Redefining the state interest today should not alter the scope of the restrictions placed on the right in the name of such state interests. The restrictions are constant, short of constitutional amendment, in effect.\n\nNow, lets look at these restrictions you mention in light of this.\n\n1. The limit of shouting \"fire\" in a theater still applies, as it was understood to be so restricted at ratification.\n\n2. Registration of arms should not apply, as it was not understood at the time. In fact, arms didn't even have serial numbers at the time, so any concept of registration could not have been imaginable to those who ratified the 2A. As such, a registration requirement is an infringement.\n\n3. Background checks on sales. Infringement or not doesn't matter. Fed's have been granted the power to regulate interstate commerce, and states their own commerce. Requiring a fee for this is a tax, and also a granted power. [**NOTE:** However, that the Federal gov doesn't have jurisdiction to force background checks for sales that don't cross state lines or involve federally licensed parties. A state does. This matters as to the implementation of background checks only, but the power has been granted to one form of government or the other, and is not reserved to individuals]. [**NOTE2:** I'm not sure the commerce clause will apply the same to non-sale transfers, such as inheriting a weapon].\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1ce4q9", "selftext": "ummm... when the constitution was written, Americans had a 4th amendment right to be secure in their property which of course included the constitutionally gauranteed right to own other human beings (african slaves)....\n\nand even when you couldn't own them, SCOTUS said they weren't citizens.\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "And that was the shitty law of the time, and the SCOTUS confirmed that.

Guns should be linked to their owners so if Unkle Jeff gives Carl a gun at random, and Carl shoots a kid next week, we can hold Unkle Jeff accountable as well. If I let John drive my car while he is drunk and he kills someone, I am held accountable. \n\ninb4 \"our constitution is perfect and imacculate and our government structure is the best in the world\" argument either.

Seizure may be unconstitutional if a conviction for possession is not made, as the 4th also states that compensation is required for seized property.\n\n5th: This depends on the registration requirements via Haynes (self incrimination), and is a *clear violation of the due process requirement*.\n\nHIPAA: I'm pretty sure this is a clear violation, also, assuming the medical records were actually used, rather than a simple statement from some doctor.", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "id": "t1_c9cg34y", "parent_id": "t3_1c2ic6", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431605244, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9cg34y", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1365616639", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}

That sort of thing has to be prevented.\n\n&gt; i'd say it's not a pre-requisite for registration to enforce a possession law.\nIt's not a prerequisite unless you want the policy to actually prevent any violence. For instance, in most states possession of a weapon during the commission of a felony is just a \"tack on\" charge where it's just used to rack up penalties... but could never prevent the felony. It's what prosecutors use to cover their ass if they can't make the other charges stick.\n\nBut to prevent anything, you would have to know that the felon possessed a weapon outside of the commission of a crime. Registration is required for that, otherwise you would have to search them without due cause (4A violation). Otherwise there's no way to get the weapon before the commission of a crime or other condition of reasonable suspicion (and the same standards apply to that suspicion for felons and non-felons).\n\nSo, while a law against possession can be on the books, it will never prevent anything without registration.\n\n&gt; so there's only 2 reasons why you couldn't pass a background check (ie acquire registration), i think. mental defect and felon status.\n\nNICS form 4473 lists the following 11 questions (answers required to pass in parenthesis):\na.

I haven't heard of a newer one. However, I've been to gun shows, and can confirm that 99.9% of sales there go through background checks. (Because all of the dealers are FFLs). As the washington post and others have [pointed out](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/the-stale-claim-that-40-percent-of-gun-sales-lack-background-checks/2013/01/20/e42ec050-629a-11e2-b05a-605528f6b712_blog.html), even that ancient 40% statistic is on extremely shaky grounds, due to poor design and extremely small sample size.\n\n&gt;not in all circumstances, what about the law that says felons can't possess weapons? (besides obviously running afoul of the 2nd Amendment)\n\nPreventing felons from possessing weapons, AFAIK, does not conflict with the 2A, and this was held as such in the Heller SCOTUS decision, so I have no problem with that restriction. In general, I support the other groups of people that are excluded in the Heller decision as well, but with the caveat that restriction of this right should be subject to due process. \n\nDue process is automatic in the case of a felony conviction, but no framework currently exists for the application of due process for restricting the right when it comes to mentally ill. There was a case recently where a woman was forcibly committed under false grounds, and that was used as a basis for confiscation. That sort of thing has to be prevented.\n\n&gt; i'd say it's not a pre-requisite for registration to enforce a possession law.\nIt's not a prerequisite unless you want the policy to actually prevent any violence. For instance, in most states possession of a weapon during the commission of a felony is just a \"tack on\" charge where it's just used to rack up penalties... but could never prevent the felony. It's what prosecutors use to cover their ass if they can't make the other charges stick.\n\nBut to prevent anything, you would have to know that the felon possessed a weapon outside of the commission of a crime. Registration is required for that, otherwise you would have to search them without due cause (4A violation). Otherwise there's no way to get the weapon before the commission of a crime or other condition of reasonable suspicion (and the same standards apply to that suspicion for felons and non-felons).\n\nSo, while a law against possession can be on the books, it will never prevent anything without registration.\n\n&gt; so there's only 2 reasons why you couldn't pass a background check (ie acquire registration), i think. mental defect and felon status.\n\nNICS form 4473 lists the following 11 questions (answers required to pass in parenthesis):\na. Are you the purchaser/trasnferee of the firearm (to prevent straw purchases)(YES)\nb. Are you under indictment or info for a felony (NO)\nc. Have you been convicted of a felony (NO)\nd. Are you a fugative (NO)\ne. Are you an unlawfuluser, or addicted to, pot, depressant, stims, narcotics, or controlled substances.(NO)\nf. Have you been adjucated mentally defective, *or* committed to a mental institution (NO)\ng. Dishonorable discharge from armed forces (NO)\nh. Are you subject to court order for harassing, stalking, etc domestic (NO)\ni. Have you been convicted of misdomeanor domestic violence (NO)\nj. Have you renounced US citizenship (NO)\nk. Are you an illegal alien (NO)\nl. Alien under nonimmigrant visa(NO)\n\nAlso, under current rules, the background check information can't be stored nationally as a registration of firearms ownership (there are time limits involved), but most records are held at the FFL's location.\n\n&gt; so if you accept the premise that possession laws don't require registration to be enforceable, and 0% of the possible cases fall into the catch 22 in which you describe, then aren't we just spinning our wheels for nothing? \n\nI don't accept as above, as I reject the law as completely useless if it can't be used to prevent crime. Registration is required for prevention (as I outlined above), and using registration information for this prosecution is specifically prevented by the Haynes decision.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bzzlb", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I've been to shows in FL and TX where it has been the case that all dealers with tables tend to be FFLs (charging full retail or more, actually).

I haven't heard of a newer one. However, I've been to gun shows, and can confirm that 99.9% of sales there go through background checks. (Because all of the dealers are FFLs). As the washington post and others have [pointed out](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/the-stale-claim-that-40-percent-of-gun-sales-lack-background-checks/2013/01/20/e42ec050-629a-11e2-b05a-605528f6b712_blog.html), even that ancient 40% statistic is on extremely shaky grounds, due to poor design and extremely small sample size.\n\n&gt;not in all circumstances, what about the law that says felons can't possess weapons? (besides obviously running afoul of the 2nd Amendment)\n\nPreventing felons from possessing weapons, AFAIK, does not conflict with the 2A, and this was held as such in the Heller SCOTUS decision, so I have no problem with that restriction. In general, I support the other groups of people that are excluded in the Heller decision as well, but with the caveat that restriction of this right should be subject to due process. \n\nDue process is automatic in the case of a felony conviction, but no framework currently exists for the application of due process for restricting the right when it comes to mentally ill. There was a case recently where a woman was forcibly committed under false grounds, and that was used as a basis for confiscation. That sort of thing has to be prevented.\n\n&gt; i'd say it's not a pre-requisite for registration to enforce a possession law.\nIt's not a prerequisite unless you want the policy to actually prevent any violence. For instance, in most states possession of a weapon during the commission of a felony is just a \"tack on\" charge where it's just used to rack up penalties... but could never prevent the felony. It's what prosecutors use to cover their ass if they can't make the other charges stick.\n\nBut to prevent anything, you would have to know that the felon possessed a weapon outside of the commission of a crime. Registration is required for that, otherwise you would have to search them without due cause (4A violation). Otherwise there's no way to get the weapon before the commission of a crime or other condition of reasonable suspicion (and the same standards apply to that suspicion for felons and non-felons).\n\nSo, while a law against possession can be on the books, it will never prevent anything without registration.\n\n&gt; so there's only 2 reasons why you couldn't pass a background check (ie acquire registration), i think. mental defect and felon status.\n\nNICS form 4473 lists the following 11 questions (answers required to pass in parenthesis):\na. Are you the purchaser/trasnferee of the firearm (to prevent straw purchases)(YES)\nb. Are you under indictment or info for a felony (NO)\nc. Have you been convicted of a felony (NO)\nd. Are you a fugative (NO)\ne. Are you an unlawfuluser, or addicted to, pot, depressant, stims, narcotics, or controlled substances.(NO)\nf. Have you been adjucated mentally defective, *or* committed to a mental institution (NO)\ng. Dishonorable discharge from armed forces (NO)\nh. Are you subject to court order for harassing, stalking, etc domestic (NO)\ni. Have you been convicted of misdomeanor domestic violence (NO)\nj. Have you renounced US citizenship (NO)\nk. Are you an illegal alien (NO)\nl. Alien under nonimmigrant visa(NO)\n\nAlso, under current rules, the background check information can't be stored nationally as a registration of firearms ownership (there are time limits involved), but most records are held at the FFL's location.\n\n&gt; so if you accept the premise that possession laws don't require registration to be enforceable, and 0% of the possible cases fall into the catch 22 in which you describe, then aren't we just spinning our wheels for nothing? \n\nI don't accept as above, as I reject the law as completely useless if it can't be used to prevent crime.

In general, I support the other groups of people that are excluded in the Heller decision as well, but with the caveat that restriction of this right should be subject to due process. \n\nDue process is automatic in the case of a felony conviction, but no framework currently exists for the application of due process for restricting the right when it comes to mentally ill. There was a case recently where a woman was forcibly committed under false grounds, and that was used as a basis for confiscation. That sort of thing has to be prevented.\n\n&gt; i'd say it's not a pre-requisite for registration to enforce a possession law.\nIt's not a prerequisite unless you want the policy to actually prevent any violence. For instance, in most states possession of a weapon during the commission of a felony is just a \"tack on\" charge where it's just used to rack up penalties... but could never prevent the felony. It's what prosecutors use to cover their ass if they can't make the other charges stick.\n\nBut to prevent anything, you would have to know that the felon possessed a weapon outside of the commission of a crime. Registration is required for that, otherwise you would have to search them without due cause (4A violation). Otherwise there's no way to get the weapon before the commission of a crime or other condition of reasonable suspicion (and the same standards apply to that suspicion for felons and non-felons).\n\nSo, while a law against possession can be on the books, it will never prevent anything without registration.\n\n&gt; so there's only 2 reasons why you couldn't pass a background check (ie acquire registration), i think. mental defect and felon status.\n\nNICS form 4473 lists the following 11 questions (answers required to pass in parenthesis):\na.

It guarantees a select militia of the sort the Stuart kings found useful, but not the people\u2019s militia that was the concern of the founding generation.\n\nAnd from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia_%28United_States%29):\n&gt;The National Guard (or National Guard of a State) differs from the National Guard of the United States; however, the two do go hand-in-hand.\n\n&gt;The National Guard is a militia force organized by each of the several states and territories of the United States. Established under Title 10 and Title 32 of the U.S. Code, state National Guard serves as part of the first-line defense for the United States.[35] The state National Guard is divided up into units stationed in each of the 50 states and U.S. territories and operates under their respective state governor or territorial government.[36] The National Guard may be called up for active duty by the state governors or territorial commanding generals to help respond to domestic emergencies and disasters, such as those caused by hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes.[36]\n\n&gt;The National Guard of the United States is a military reserve force composed of state National Guard members or units under federally recognized active or inactive armed force service for the United States.[37][38] Created by the Militia Act of 1903, the National Guard of the United States is a joint reserve component of the United States Army and the United States Air Force.\n\nSo, \"National Guard\" has more than one meaning. The US NG is part of the us Military (*not* a militia), the State's NG is an *organized militia*.\n\nHowever, as from Heller, neither is the \"unorganized\" or \"citizens\" militia to which the 2A refers, as they were created by federal law and not in existence before the Constitution.\n\nAt the top of that article, the difference is further highlighted:\n\n* The organized militia created by the Militia Act of 1903, which split from the 1792 Uniform Militia forces, and consist of State militia forces, notably the National Guard and the Naval Militia.[2] The National Guard however, is not to be confused with the National Guard of the United States, which is a federally recognized reserve military force, although the two are linked.\n* The reserve militia[3] or unorganized militia, which is presently defined by the Militia Act of 1903 to consist of every able-bodied man of at least 17 and under 45 years of age who is not a member of the National Guard or Naval Militia.(That is, anyone who would be eligible for a draft.) Former members of the armed forces up to age 65 are also considered part of the \"unorganized militia\" per Sec 313 Title 32 of the US Code.[2]\n", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "id": "t1_c972xby", "parent_id": "t1_c96sklq", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431698010, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c972xby", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364925664", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "id": "t1_c96sklq", "parent_id": "t1_c96ptrg", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431702959, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96sklq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364878373", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "id": "t1_c96ptrg", "parent_id": "t1_c96ntbk", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431704254, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96ptrg", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364869412", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "id": "t1_c96ntbk", "parent_id": "t1_c96k4mx", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431705214, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96ntbk", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364863260", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "id": "t1_c96k4mx", "parent_id": "t1_c965kz6", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431706951, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96k4mx", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364853847", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}

Superficially, the evidence for this deterrence belief seems persuasive. Table 1, for instance, shows that Denmark has roughly half the gun ownership rate of neighboring (across the Baltic) Norway, but a one third higher murder rate; **and Russia, another neighbor of Norway, has only one ninth Norway\u2019s gun ownership rate but a 900% higher murder rate.** Looking at tables 1-3 it is easy to find nations in which very high gun ownership rates correlate with very low murder rates while other nations with very low gun ownership rates have much higher murder rates.

It may be useful to begin with a few examples. One is the compound assertion that: (a) guns are uniquely available in the U.S. compared to other modern developed nations,\nwhich is why (b) the U.S. has by far the highest murder rate.\nThough this has been endlessly repeated, in fact, b) is false and a) substantially so. The false assertion that the U.S. has the industrialized world\u2019s highest murder rate is an artifact of politically motivated Soviet minimization of true Russian homicide rates since at least 1965. As of many years before that date Russia had extremely stringent gun controls3 which were effectuated by a police state apparatus providing for extremely stringent enforcement. 4 So successful was that regime that few Russian civilians have firearms and very few murders involve them.5 Yet manifest success in keeping its people disarmed has not prevented Russia from having far and away the highest murder rate in the developed world. 6 In the 1960s and early \u201870s, gun-less Russia\u2019s murder rates paralleled (generally exceeded) those of gun-ridden America. As American rates first stabilized and then steeply declined, Russian murder increased so drastically that by the early 1990s the Russian rate was three times higher than the U.S. As of 1998-2004 (the latest figure available for Russia) Russian murder rates were nearly four times higher than American. Much higher murder rates than the U.S. ever had also characterize the Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and various other now-independent European parts of the former U.S.S.R.7 Thus in the U.S., the former Soviet Union, and current-day Russia, \u201chomicide results suggest that where guns are scarce other weapons are substituted in killings. 8\u201d \n\nRelevant footnotes:\n&gt;4 **Russian law did and does flatly prohibit civilian possession of handguns and limits long guns to licensed hunters.** Id.

No\ndictionary has ever adopted that definition, and we have been apprised of no source that indicates that it carried that meaning at the time of the founding.

It is particularly wrongheaded to read Miller for more than what it said, because the case did not even purport to be a thorough examination of the Second Amendment.\n\nFurther, specifically Heller states that the standard in Miller is:\n&gt;We think that Miller\u2019s \u201cordinary military equipment\u201d language must be read in tandem with what comes after: \u201c[O]rdinarily when called for [militia] service [able-bodied] men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.\u201d 307 U.

It can be so called, and the expectations for any militia called today are the same as in the reading from Heller above. That they come with weapons in \"common use for lawful purposes\" today. \n\nThe only purpose of the 2A in the Miller decision, then, is to protect the unorganized militia by ensuring they have guns. Stating that this is limited to weapons either from 1776 or 1939 completely obviates this stated purpose, according to Miller.\n\nTo state that your interpretation of Miller is what applies also has to ignore the actual case ruling in Heller that a weapon in common use for lawful purposes in 2008 was protected by the 2A, regardless of availability in 1776 or 1939.\n\nThe AR-15 and other \"assault weapons\" very clearly fall into the definition of weapons protected by the 2A given in Heller.\n", "id": "t1_c81rlw9", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "yes, i will agree with you that Heller states that \"that a weapon in common use for lawful purposes in 2008 was protected by the 2nd amendment\"\n\nim simply stating that up until a certain point, there was little to no difference between the arms a militia-man would show up with if he were called into duty and what he used \"for lawful purposes like self defense\" (and i think you would agree we could add hunting for subsistence or for sport, protecting a domicile and its occupants, and sport shooting as lawful purposes)\n\nand your quote says the same thing:  \"The traditional militia was formed from a pool of men bringing arms \u201cin common use at the time\u201d for lawful purposes like self-defense. \u201cIn the colonial and revolu\u00adtionary war era, [small-arms] weapons used by militiamen and weapons used in defense of person and home were one and the same.\u201d \n\nso its not hard to see we're on the same page.\n\nnow, you have to set out some basic criteria for what constitutes \"in common use at the time\" if the time you're speaking about is 2013.  \n\nIn theory, you could argue that if one (1) person only one (1) time uses an AR-15 for any lawful purpose at all, then that fulfills the requirement of \"in common use at the time.\"  then, even though that one person may use a 1911 on his hip for personal protection and on his nightstand for domicile/family protection, and a shotgun for hunting, the AR-15 is a weapon that can be considered \"in common use.\" However, that's quite untenable, and isn't in keeping with the spirit of the word \"common.\" \n\nthe other theoretical end of the spectrum is that an AR-15  is owned and used almost universally, something like 98% of gun owners have one and use it exclusively or almost exclusively for the \"lawful purposes\" described above.  However, that's theoretically untenable also. AR-15s were born and bred from combat, consistently tinkered with and improved to do a better job at killing \"enemy combatants\" in order to offer better value and efficacy to militaries around the world.  The kinds of things that make it great for killing people also put it at a disadvantage (though not excluding it) for \"lawful purposes\" such as its size and weight, the barrel's tendency to get hot after firing repeated rounds, in some cases bullet cost, etc. \n\nso, as neither of those ends of the spectrum really address the question, you do as they did in both Heller and Miller and you go back to the history for insight.  \n\nRemember, you're looking back into history for insight to see if an AR-15 can be considered \"in common use for lawful purposes.\" Miller and Heller say that small arms are protected because in history (and still today) those weapons were \"used in defense of person and home were one and the same.\u201d  so if an AR-15 can be counted as protected using Miller and Heller's argument, history should show that historically, the AR-15 meets the same kind of requirements.     \n\nMiller and Heller looked back into history and found that guns in \"common use\" during the time were muskets. and they were right. and what kind of weapons did Miller and Heller rightfully declare warranted constitutional protection? weapons in common use at the time. and that's right. Problem was, that musket in 1776 was privately owned, and expected to be put into militia service if need be. it was what the citizen/soldier would use for the primary purposes of the Second Amendment, personal protection, hunting for sustenance, property protection, national defense, and shooting sports (which im sure existed back then, dick swinging competitions are almost as old as humans themselves). So in that respect, the militia weapon and the weapon in \"common use\" at the time was the same thing. So it all made sense. Right around WW1, however, the precursors to what we would call \"assault rifles\" came along. this is where we find the divergence. assault rifles became specialized for use in war (smaller, larger ammo capacity, aforementioned accessories for the purposes described in the Brady explanation but not necessarily limited to war) with armies around the world being the primary market for these weapons. Technological advances in rifles, shotguns, and pistols made them better weapons for hunting, self defense, domicile defense, and shooting sports (although shooting sports are a grey area, you could argue that assault rifles make for more fun target practice than a musket). As assault weapons became more specialized, and advances in technology to pistols, shotguns, and rifles tailored them to what people were using them for, your ability to say that an AR-15 is in \"common use\" today the same way it was when the supreme court wrote those decisions finds little historical backing.     \n\nultimately, however, the answer will be found when a judge looks at a number of factors, likely including history, sales figures (either in total number or as a percentage of all guns sold) and other things to determine whether you could call weapons such as AR-15s \"in common use for lawful purposes\" in 2013.  Ultimately a judge will have to answer what \"in common use\" means.\n\nhowever, as an aside, if \"assault weapons\" (not assault rifles) are no more powerful than a hunting rifle, no more deadly than one, and their accessories don't make them any more lethal, and they're bad choices for criminals anyways (the statistics say that they're involved in a miniscule number of gun related deaths every year) does that make their owners the rough equivalent of the douchebags that buy hummers and put chrome bits on them and never take them off-road? or civics with fart-can exhausts?  It just seems wasteful to me.  just buy a damn hunting rifle.\n\ndo they buy them because they look cool? because they want to look tough or \"gangsta\"? because they want to relive their military days?  maybe it's about \"expressing your 2nd amendment right\" to the fullest?\n\nas someone who's ambivalent to the whole thing, please explain.

Those are referenced to the previous Miller decision.\n\nAlso, it says \"lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home\". This means it's not to protect the home, but rather the occupant. That is quite different than protecting a building.\n\nLike you said, extrapolate at your own risk here. However, it doesn't define who it's dangerous for. One can reason that it must not mean dangerous to the attacker, as we're talking about lethal self-defense here. It's supposed to kill that guy. Logically, this must mean dangerous to the person firing the weapon, or to the public in general. This is generally a prohibition on things like using suicide vests for self defense. \n\nHowever, it's the Miller decision that is so important here. The reason that Heller ruled that a ban on handguns is unconstitutional is that they are in \"common use\". The same is true for an AR15, which is hailed as the \"modern musket\", and also has a remarkable safety record.\n\nAny sporting uses are also covered. Self defense is listed as a specification of \"lawful use\", not a restriction on it. Using guns in sporting events is lawful, and their use is as such protected by the second amendment. \n\nThere is no \"reasonable person\" test for the 2nd amendment. Heller states only the \"dangerous or unusual\" tests.\n\nTo you personally, I suggest reading Jeff Cooper's book on self defense. He ran security forces in mogadishu, and had far too many opportunities to use them. The techniques he developed are \"scary\" to most gun control advocates, but they have saved countless lives. His techniques are the basis of nearly all armed self defense, and is used not only by citizens, but by police forces around the world. \n\nThe reason I suggest this is that you seem to feel that a self defense weapon should not be \"efficent\", and that features that ban it's effectiveness should be banned. This makes no sense in any defense situation. Being under-armed is, frankly, suicide in that situation. This is the fact so well detailed in Cooper's writings. \n\nIt stands to follow that any restriction on a self defense weapon that decrease it's efficency is no different than a restriction on self defense itself. Killing efficently is the only thing that will save your life. As hard as it is to swallow for some, the right to self defense is a right to kill, and it is about killing, and always has been.\n\n\n", "id": "t1_c81lx4b", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "off into the weeds we go.  \n\n1. i used a \"reasonable person\" test because legally speaking, its a great way to inject objectivity into the debate.

The traditional militia was formed from a pool of men bringing arms \u201cin common use at the time\u201d for lawful purposes like self-defense. \u201cIn the colonial and revolu\u00ad tionary war era, [small-arms] weapons used by militiamen and weapons used in defense of person and home were one and the same.\u201d \n\nLimiting that definition to any period of time like you are, saying that it was saying that weapons other than muskets, or those available in 1939 (which includes most gun designs), denies the fact that the Militia may be called again today with those same requirements. It can be so called, and the expectations for any militia called today are the same as in the reading from Heller above. That they come with weapons in \"common use for lawful purposes\" today. \n\nThe only purpose of the 2A in the Miller decision, then, is to protect the unorganized militia by ensuring they have guns. Stating that this is limited to weapons either from 1776 or 1939 completely obviates this stated purpose, according to Miller.\n\nTo state that your interpretation of Miller is what applies also has to ignore the actual case ruling in Heller that a weapon in common use for lawful purposes in 2008 was protected by the 2A, regardless of availability in 1776 or 1939.\n\nThe AR-15 and other \"assault weapons\" very clearly fall into the definition of weapons protected by the 2A given in Heller.\n", "id": "t1_c81rlw9", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "yes, i will agree with you that Heller states that \"that a weapon in common use for lawful purposes in 2008 was protected by the 2nd amendment\"\n\nim simply stating that up until a certain point, there was little to no difference between the arms a militia-man would show up with if he were called into duty and what he used \"for lawful purposes like self defense\" (and i think you would agree we could add hunting for subsistence or for sport, protecting a domicile and its occupants, and sport shooting as lawful purposes)\n\nand your quote says the same thing:  \"The traditional militia was formed from a pool of men bringing arms \u201cin common use at the time\u201d for lawful purposes like self-defense. \u201cIn the colonial and revolu\u00adtionary war era, [small-arms] weapons used by militiamen and weapons used in defense of person and home were one and the same.\u201d \n\nso its not hard to see we're on the same page.\n\nnow, you have to set out some basic criteria for what constitutes \"in common use at the time\" if the time you're speaking about is 2013.  \n\nIn theory, you could argue that if one (1) person only one (1) time uses an AR-15 for any lawful purpose at all, then that fulfills the requirement of \"in common use at the time.\"  then, even though that one person may use a 1911 on his hip for personal protection and on his nightstand for domicile/family protection, and a shotgun for hunting, the AR-15 is a weapon that can be considered \"in common use.\" However, that's quite untenable, and isn't in keeping with the spirit of the word \"common.\" \n\nthe other theoretical end of the spectrum is that an AR-15  is owned and used almost universally, something like 98% of gun owners have one and use it exclusively or almost exclusively for the \"lawful purposes\" described above.  However, that's theoretically untenable also. AR-15s were born and bred from combat, consistently tinkered with and improved to do a better job at killing \"enemy combatants\" in order to offer better value and efficacy to militaries around the world.  The kinds of things that make it great for killing people also put it at a disadvantage (though not excluding it) for \"lawful purposes\" such as its size and weight, the barrel's tendency to get hot after firing repeated rounds, in some cases bullet cost, etc. \n\nso, as neither of those ends of the spectrum really address the question, you do as they did in both Heller and Miller and you go back to the history for insight.  \n\nRemember, you're looking back into history for insight to see if an AR-15 can be considered \"in common use for lawful purposes.\" Miller and Heller say that small arms are protected because in history (and still today) those weapons were \"used in defense of person and home were one and the same.\u201d  so if an AR-15 can be counted as protected using Miller and Heller's argument, history should show that historically, the AR-15 meets the same kind of requirements.     \n\nMiller and Heller looked back into history and found that guns in \"common use\" during the time were muskets. and they were right. and what kind of weapons did Miller and Heller rightfully declare warranted constitutional protection? weapons in common use at the time. and that's right. Problem was, that musket in 1776 was privately owned, and expected to be put into militia service if need be. it was what the citizen/soldier would use for the primary purposes of the Second Amendment, personal protection, hunting for sustenance, property protection, national defense, and shooting sports (which im sure existed back then, dick swinging competitions are almost as old as humans themselves). So in that respect, the militia weapon and the weapon in \"common use\" at the time was the same thing. So it all made sense. Right around WW1, however, the precursors to what we would call \"assault rifles\" came along. this is where we find the divergence. assault rifles became specialized for use in war (smaller, larger ammo capacity, aforementioned accessories for the purposes described in the Brady explanation but not necessarily limited to war) with armies around the world being the primary market for these weapons. Technological advances in rifles, shotguns, and pistols made them better weapons for hunting, self defense, domicile defense, and shooting sports (although shooting sports are a grey area, you could argue that assault rifles make for more fun target practice than a musket). As assault weapons became more specialized, and advances in technology to pistols, shotguns, and rifles tailored them to what people were using them for, your ability to say that an AR-15 is in \"common use\" today the same way it was when the supreme court wrote those decisions finds little historical backing.     \n\nultimately, however, the answer will be found when a judge looks at a number of factors, likely including history, sales figures (either in total number or as a percentage of all guns sold) and other things to determine whether you could call weapons such as AR-15s \"in common use for lawful purposes\" in 2013.  Ultimately a judge will have to answer what \"in common use\" means.\n\nhowever, as an aside, if \"assault weapons\" (not assault rifles) are no more powerful than a hunting rifle, no more deadly than one, and their accessories don't make them any more lethal, and they're bad choices for criminals anyways (the statistics say that they're involved in a miniscule number of gun related deaths every year) does that make their owners the rough equivalent of the douchebags that buy hummers and put chrome bits on them and never take them off-road? or civics with fart-can exhausts?  It just seems wasteful to me.  just buy a damn hunting rifle.\n\ndo they buy them because they look cool? because they want to look tough or \"gangsta\"? because they want to relive their military days?  maybe it's about \"expressing your 2nd amendment right\" to the fullest?\n\nas someone who's ambivalent to the whole thing, please explain.

The supreme court disagrees strongly with you, stating specifically that the right to keep and bear arms is disconnected from any militia service.

The word \u201cArms\u201d would have two different meanings at once: \u201cweapons\u201d (as the object of \u201ckeep\u201d) and (as the object of \u201cbear\u201d) one-half of an idiom.

Pp. 2\u201353. \n\n&gt; (a) The Amendment\u2019s prefatory clause announces a purpose, but does not limit or expand the scope of the second part, the operative clause. The operative clause\u2019s text and history demonstrate that it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms.

The \u201cmilitia\u201d comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens\u2019 militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule. The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens\u2019 militia would be preserved. Pp. 22\u201328.\n\n&gt; (c) The Court\u2019s interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately followed the Second Amendment. Pp. 28\u201330.\n\n&gt; (d) The Second Amendment\u2019s drafting history, while of dubious interpretive worth, reveals three state Second Amendment proposals that unequivocally referred to an individual right to bear arms. Pp. 30\u201332.\n\n&gt; (e) Interpretation of the Second Amendment by scholars, courts and legislators, from immediately after its ratification through the late 19th century also supports the Court\u2019s conclusion.

This is throughly debunked in the Kate &amp; Mauser paper. Particularly noteworth here is the fact that the vast majority of people who commit violent crimes have committed many crimes previously. If the presence of guns themselves were causing this effect, then it would present itself not only among the population with a criminal record in the past (typical offenders), but also among the law-abiding population in places like the US where guns are ever present. This finding is not found.\n\nFurther, even if you were to accept that thesis, then you would need to consider the selection bias introduced by the collection of statistics. If you pull a gun on someone and do not use it, it will likely still result in a charge or a police report. Whereas if your weapon of choice was, say, a 2x4 it's far less likely that charges would be pressed and statistics collected. \n\nImagine if a robber went into a convenience store with a gun and attempted to rob a cashier behind bullet proof glass. This gets reported as a violent crime, successful or not. If the same robber came in with a less effective weapon, like the 2x4, it's far more likely the charge is for vandalism for scratching the glass, or yet more likely that he would have never attempted the crime in the first place.\n\nThis \"never attempted the crime in the first place\" is yet another source of statistical uncertainty in comparing gun violence to non-gun violence. It's not only that gun control may simply prevent a negative effect (as in less crime with guns), but that it also reduces the positive effect of self defense, or even the assumption of self defence. \n\nWhen a criminal can assume that than any attempt at violent crime may be met with effective deadly force (a gun carrying victim), they are vastly less likely (proven by criminology studies of interviews with inmates) to attempt the crime. Criminals don't take risks unless they are certain of superior force. The net effect here is the supression of occurances of violent crime using weapons other than guns.\n\nThese biases (biaseseseses) alone would prevent me from believing that there is an \"instrumentality effect\" to guns that is unique to that form of weapons. For these reasons, it should *always* raise red flags when people start citing statisics that relate only to one weapon or another, and it is far more instructive to analyse the totality of the violent crime picture to determine results of gun policy. \n\nBased on this, I still hold that the Austrailian ban has been a major failure, based on the 42% increase in violent crime (of all forms) since it's adoption. If things are better there, then why is it 3x more likely for a woman to be raped in Austraila than in the US?

First, BATFE can only regulate FFLs because there is an assumption that they are engaged in interstate commerce (they would need to buy guns from elsewhere). This gives them jurisdiction to regulate their activity and require the background checks through NICS. It's worth noting here that gun shows are 99.9% FFL dealers, and do run NICS checks at the shows.\nHowever, by no means is a private property transaction on a face to face basis by individuals under federal jurisdiction. It's not interstate commerce unless you're standing on opposite sides of a state line. The federal government just has no right to interfere with an individuals transaction in this case.\nTo gain jurisdiction, you have to remove the property rights of the individuals (against the 4th amendment), which means leasing your guns from the federal government. This just isn't going to happen, as they also can't sieze the 300 million existing guns (if they paid a fair value, as defined in 4th, it would cost more than $3 trillion, assuming $1k each on average).\n\n2. Go talk to some people with FFLs. This doesn't happen. Cite a source on this. BATFE stats don't reflect this at all. There is no difference in the regulation and reporting requirements no matter if you're a home FFL or mortar and brick. The only recent straw purchases done by FFLs were those forced by BATFE itself (as exposed by the recorded phone calls where the FFL refused, knowing it was a straw purcahser, and BATFE said they'd revoke the FFL if he refused to complete the transaction) as part of Wide Receiver and Fast and Furious.\n3. Shall not be infringed. In most states, licenses and tests are required for concealed carry permits. This is essentially the same thing as a poll tax, meaning it does nothing. Again federals have no jurisdiction over private transactions within a state (not involving FFL holders), and can't push any requirements. However, all of the consequences of not knowing how to deal with a gun safely are *already* massively illegal (aka negligent homicide, etc). Also, those crimes are state things, not federal (unless you kill a congressman, federal judge, etc), as the federal government if barred from policing the states.\n\nGiven that the shooter murdered someone and stole the weapons for the school shooting, I highly doubt these requirements would do anything but harm law abiding people.
