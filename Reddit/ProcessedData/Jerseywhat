I studied a bit and like to think of myself as someone makes a good attempt to understand government,but health care is one of those things that I go into seriously doubting my ability to know what's going on. It's just... such a massive and complex chunk of economy. It's FAR from a typical market in so many ways. That said..\n\nJust like at work, the first thing I consider is other case studies (competitors). There are a few different models. The main ideas seem to be that they include universal care, lower costs, and better result. It's pretty hard to argue with real world results, but markets are always a bit different from each other and you can't forget that. \n\nThe main critique, as I've understood it, is the market needs to be profitable to drive innovation. That's not bullshit. (Don't get me started on Patents...) Still, you can't wipe away all the real world evidence, but it certainly merits thinking: perhaps there's a better way. An American style (at least IMO) solution that's more free market than Europe, because trust me (worked for years in Europe, including as a small business owner) it's MUCH better that way.  They go too far and it crimps business. \n\nSo ideally, the left and the right fight it out and come up with something better. It won't be perfect and require work, but it won't be the disaster of letting either party have their way. \n\nThe final question is: is Obamacare that? I don't know. The ideas seemed nice and the 'states rights' in me likes giving states a choice, but one of the biggest aspects- electronic records has already completely failed to produce savings. For whatever reason- the right getting too much and/or the left just putting together a crappy plan (frankly a very considerable concern- gov't isn't easy), it's reasonable to be concerned that the end result isn't close enough to what the system is supposed to produce.  \n\nI guess I just hope it stays in effect (and effective, plenty of ways the right help this fail) long enough so we can see. Might as well find out after everything and hell, we stayed in Iraq and Afghanistan way to freaking long why not play out what our elected representatives came up with on health care. \n\nAnd screw blaming congress, anything that goes wrong is the American people's fault.

How often the right is correct about us that we want gov\u2019t to solve everything, we\u2019re anti-business, and we don\u2019t have respect for people with a different view point. Dear god it\u2019s so true\u2026 so often\u2026 \n\n-We assume if something is making money it\u2019s evil. Especially wall street, e.g., super-fast trading algorithms. No respect or attempt to understand the value that banks, insurance, and wall street provide to businesses, people, and life in general. Tiny portion of executives making huge salaries looks bad, but it\u2019s like NOTHING of our total economy. The left just assumes there is some way to regulate and fix that, without even stopping to consider how it\u2019s not that freaking simple. No cost/benefit analysis is done about what it would take to make that change and if it\u2019s worth the resulting benefit. \n\n-Failure to understand that unions are just as corruptible as a corporate board and that even in cases where unions are good, they come at a real cost that goes beyond dues. \n\n-The need to do \u2018something\u2019 and \u2018think of the children\u2019 (Rev. Lovejoy\u2019s wife syndrome is what I call it), so Tipper Gore and everyone like her\n\n-We push things based on how good they sound, not how effective they are (assault weapons ban)\n\n-Sin taxes aka puss out taxes (cig tax for pre-school? Pre-school is great (evidence driven policy), but fuck you raise real taxes!! \u2018man\u2019 up!)\n\n-Relationship with entertainment industry (we all shat on GOP when they fired a guy who wrote a white paper on copyright reform, but would the left do any better?)\n\n-Intervening overseas: Iraq was an extremely bad case, but we\u2019re no where near being an anti-war enough to balance out GOP. How many liberals are itching for us to do something about Syria? \n\n-Corporations are not people! (Oh my fucking god\u2026 corporate personhood people it\u2019s a fucking legal concept. It\u2019s not corporation=person.)\n\n-Addressing failures/tough truths: Public housing didn\u2019t work. \n\n-Different view point: Do I think it\u2019s a little weird that people LOVE guns? Yeah I do. But you know what? That\u2019s emotion, not policy. There will always be crazy people. Don't t use them to describe a whole swath of our population. Another good example is Rand Paul saying he didn\u2019t like the one part (out of 9 I think) of the Civil Rights Act that regulated private business. I think he later said he would still vote for it, but all kinds of rabble rabble called him a racist after that. Rand Paul is one of the FEW (only?) senators addressing the war on drugs which is still happening and unbelievably damaging to minorities.  Does he get any credit for this? No. Should he? Hell fucking yes. \n\nMain idea: what I remember reading in Locke (I think?). America is awesome because the main idea is that gov\u2019t usually blows so it should only get involved if it really, really has to.  The left needs to remember this. We shouldn't be afraid of conceding that argument.

Shiiit.  I studied a bit and like to think of myself as someone makes a good attempt to understand government,but health care is one of those things that I go into seriously doubting my ability to know what's going on. It's just... such a massive and complex chunk of economy. It's FAR from a typical market in so many ways. That said..\n\nJust like at work, the first thing I consider is other case studies (competitors). There are a few different models. The main ideas seem to be that they include universal care, lower costs, and better result. It's pretty hard to argue with real world results, but markets are always a bit different from each other and you can't forget that. \n\nThe main critique, as I've understood it, is the market needs to be profitable to drive innovation. That's not bullshit. (Don't get me started on Patents...) Still, you can't wipe away all the real world evidence, but it certainly merits thinking: perhaps there's a better way. An American style (at least IMO) solution that's more free market than Europe, because trust me (worked for years in Europe, including as a small business owner) it's MUCH better that way.  They go too far and it crimps business. \n\nSo ideally, the left and the right fight it out and come up with something better. It won't be perfect and require work, but it won't be the disaster of letting either party have their way. \n\nThe final question is: is Obamacare that? I don't know. The ideas seemed nice and the 'states rights' in me likes giving states a choice, but one of the biggest aspects- electronic records has already completely failed to produce savings. For whatever reason- the right getting too much and/or the left just putting together a crappy plan (frankly a very considerable concern- gov't isn't easy), it's reasonable to be concerned that the end result isn't close enough to what the system is supposed to produce.  \n\nI guess I just hope it stays in effect (and effective, plenty of ways the right help this fail) long enough so we can see. Might as well find out after everything and hell, we stayed in Iraq and Afghanistan way to freaking long why not play out what our elected representatives came up with on health care. \n\nAnd screw blaming congress, anything that goes wrong is the American people's fault. We're the ones voting or more often, not voting. 37% vote in non-Presidential election years. No wonder it's a mess.

Quite ironically- considering how much conservatives pan a planned economy as simply untenable, this view gives communism way too much credit. Perhaps Reagan and other presidents did things to increase the costs of the cold war, but let\u2019s not kid ourselves- that was a two way street. Even Eisenhower, who was one our best leaders (well, me thinks), made the mistake of overthrowing the leadership of other countries.  (Not to mention all the wars that came later) Our way of defeating communism was hardly well managed.  \n\nEspecially considering George Kennan, writing from the US embassy in Moscow [his \u2018long telegram\u2019](http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/coldwar/documents/episode-1/kennan.htm)\n, called the USSR folding on itself in the 1940\u2019s.  Though this view was never popular (it doesn't have the same rallying power of 'coming together to defeat the enemy') there were people in US leadership who knew the USSR was held together by bullshit and bound to fall apart. \n\nAs someone who seems to speak at least some decent Russian, I\u2019m surprised you couldn\u2019t counter this yourself. When was the USSR ever doing OK? It was always a mess. Within a few years of taking power Stalin was already throwing the country between fits of liberalization and fits of a more planned economy.  Russia was able to play politics quite well, considering, and between picking up the leftovers of WWII and access to plenty of natural resources they managed to hold it together for several decades, but come on, can we really say having Carter in office would have changed the motivations/incentives/risk calculations of party insiders about the risks they faced on the streets of Russia?\n\nThough I should note that even in Eastern Europe/Russia there is a small, but real thread of support for this. (I was introduced to a Czech history professor with this in a bar once, \u2018oh get this, the guy is actually really conservative and GOP friendly\u2019 I was a little tipsy so I kind of blurted out \u2018oh you\u2019re one of those fools who think Reagan won the cold war!\u2019 He smiled and went on, with \u2018footnotes,\u2019 to explain his case.  That is to say it\u2019s not a stupid thing to think, even if it\u2019s presented often in an \u2018MURICA tone, but Russia was such a damn mess the entire time- held together by a slim group at the top who didn\u2019t want to lose their privileges (or their ability to not live in Siberian prison camp, it seems really hard to give much credit to the US.  \n\n", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Jerseywhat", "id": "t1_c9ficm9", "parent_id": "t3_1cdbn0", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1431552284, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9ficm9", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366019628", "distinguished": null, "ups": 3}

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Well, as much as Libertarians love to go on about how everything the gov\u2019t does is a waste, even they (mostly) don\u2019t think that\u2019s true for everything. It\u2019s not like they want to make murder legal and just \u2018let the market sort it out.\u2019\n\nI understand it\u2019s tempting, (after hearing the right call every/any gov\u2019t expenditure socialism), but taking their arguments to their logical extreme isn\u2019t really fair. Sure \u2018logical extreme\u2019 sounds nice because it includes \u2018logic,\u2019 but I think we can all agree the real focus is on the extreme. \n\nAnyway, to answer your question: one of the \u2018main ideas\u2019 of the Founders: government does crap work, so it should only get involved if it really, absolutely, is totally necessary.  The mistakes of the marketplace are certainly real, but it\u2019s almost always better to deal with them than to have the government try and fix it, because chances are they will fuck it up even worse and for a longer time.  (It sounds trite and simplistic, but imagine how out of this world that concept was in the time of kings and queens. )\n\nSo I would imagine, libertarians would say that it\u2019s OK to outlaw abortion because it\u2019s a pretty great case for a problem that ONLY the government can solve.  It\u2019s not like an unborn child can arm up or anything.  It\u2019s also probably based on the concept that once conception happens, that\u2019s a person who has individual rights that no one can take away. Though there is a lot of political overlap, I think it\u2019s unfair to equate this with just religion.  We can all argue over how many cells=person, but if someone thinks something is a person, we should understand their passion to protect them. That\u2019s not a group of cells, that\u2019s a little dude in there who has a heartbeat and feels pain. \n\nIt\u2019s almost ironic, but you are correct that in a sense a big pro-choice (~liberal) argument is rather conservative or libertarian-ish. That argument being that people are going to have abortions anyway, and history has taught us that unless you\u2019re rich enough to know of/pay a doctor who will break the law, an awful lot of people will end up killing themselves or hurting themselves with a DIY abortion.  Since we can\u2019t change human behavior/tendencies, better to let it be done in open, safe environment than try to legislate away bad behavior.  It\u2019s a problem, yes, but government trying to restrict people\u2019s actions isn\u2019t going to solve it, just make it worse. \n\nWhile that does roughly fit the model of conservative/libertarian thought, you\u2019re making the mistake of applying their rhetoric to everything under the sun. Of course, the result of that is there is some glaring contradiction, but that\u2019s not a function of hypocrisy, but just the fact that you can always find contradictions when you reduce political positions to single statements/concepts. When you look at the whole idea, it\u2019s clear the contradiction is actually accounted for, and you just made the mistake of over applying a simplification.  \n\nDisclaimer: I\u2019m moderate liberal who is a fan of many things libertarian so all of the above is totally up for correction, I may not be the best person to speak for libertarians, though I\u2019m often a big fan of their thought and approach to government. \n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1aiutd", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1aiutd", "selftext": "Thanks for the vote of confidence but that may be above my head.

The problem is that using the term socialist is brilliant propaganda, because you can almost consider ANY gov\u2019t intervention into the economy (911 system and firefighters) socialism.  \n\nFirst, what\u2019s communism  and what is socialism? The most important thing about communism is that according to the USSR, communism was never actually achieved. It was the utopia they were always \u2018so close\u2019 to getting to. (Well, to grossly generalize: they basically went in swings from being more \u2018socialist\u2019 (having more gov\u2019t control on economy) to more \u2018free market.\u2019 More gov\u2019t controls would tank production and people would starve, so they would allow some free market reforms, but these would threaten gov\u2019t control so they pulled back free market reforms and tossed a bunch of people to Siberia. This repeated several times before collapse). Socialism was presented, by communists, as the partial progress of reaching communism.  So it\u2019s important to remember that the term socialism was specifically used, propagated, and embraced by communists because IT COULD MEAN PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING TO ANYONE. \n\nThe important thing about socialism is to place it in context.  For example, a good question to throw these kind of people off track is asking \u201cwell Bush created an additional entitlement, Medicare Part D, that was entirely unfunded and only increased the deficit. It was very much a handout to his voting base: older voters.  Obama created another social program, ACA, but at least he funded it with taxes. Between those two choices: which is more socialist?\u201d Hopefully this drives home the need for more consideration beyond just labels.\n\nThe main idea I would get across though is how lazy and worthless the criticism is.  The best example of this is the fact that no matter how conservative you are, there is always someone MORE conservative than you who is going to call YOU a socialist. Then you might want to point how their \u2018gripe\u2019 isn\u2019t with Obama, but the country.  Conservatives may claim to hate gov\u2019t spending, but when it comes time to actually cut something the only thing people support is cutting foreign aid, a tiny, tiny portion of the total budget.  Tell them if they really want to start making a difference, they need to clean out all the \u2018socialists\u2019 in their party who  freak out at any chance in Medicare.  If the call bullshit, youtube some of the campaign ads that attacked Obama for cutting Medicare. \n\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Both of those programs were attempts to privatize healthcare more.

Without that, the whole reason for the royal family goes away. Now why is Saudi Arabia important for this story? Because after Iraq invaded Kuwait Saudi Arabia allowed the US to put US bases there (This is after a long period of buying equipment and being friendly). This REALLY REALLY PISSED A LOT OF PEOPLE OFF.  We don\u2019t really have holy sites, but imagine if where Jesus grew up was in the Midwest and we let Saudi Arabia put a military base there. One of the BIG things the terrorists want is us to get our military out of Saudi Arabia. (This by the way, is also something many libertarians want to do.) \n\nObviously there are other demands, but I think one thing worth focusing on is how Al Qaeda wants western forces to be removed from Islamic holy land.  Personally, I\u2019m with the libertarians let\u2019s do it and let Saudi Arabia deal with their own shit.  Call me an appeaser but I don\u2019t see engagement having such a good result after 30+ years of trying. \n\n\n", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Jerseywhat", "id": "t1_c8s1yt0", "parent_id": "t3_19un0p", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431522811, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8s1yt0", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1362758543", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}

I think the subtext is that under a republic some of these costly measures would be unneeded.\n\nHowever, I think there are a lot of important insights in The Prince, and I sort of wonder if during the course of writing it Machiavelli was at least slightly turned, because it does lay out a fairly effective path to power. I think the largest issue he subtly points out in The Prince is that of sustainability. He shows an individual how to gain power, then rails against giving power to someone who has not earned it. That system basically advocates civil war and would destroy all the gains that had been achieved during \"the prince's\" reign.
