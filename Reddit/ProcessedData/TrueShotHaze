This is just an increase to minimum wage, not across the board cuts or raises for everything, I don't know if you've noticed yet or not, but many of the skill-required businesses and jobs were shipped over seas and that the most basic form of income for families now are fast-food restaurants and grocery stores.

They know America isn't broke, they just believe that they can keep Americans stupid.\n\nIf they can afford all of that every year, then they sure as hell can afford to give every American a $100 per hour minimum wage increase and nobody would bat an eyelash or drop a beat of sweat.

They are willing to shut down the Government over a law just because they don't like it, they're also willing to risk a Default on the 17th (i think? correct me on the date if not), which could potentially be devastating to the economy that has worked so hard to get out of a Recession, just to bring it back there.\n\nHouse GOP Tea Party Republicans are acting like Domestic Terrorists, and they are nothing more than that, they've wasted so much of the Tax Payers dime trying to repeal Obamacare (37?) times that it's made today's Congress one of the most pathetic excuse for how to run a Government in centuries.

They believe the old healthcare system worked just fine and didn't need changed, so they're trying to \"save it\" in their eyes, when the old healthcare system was actually kinda like a mother drowning her child in the bathtub. Not everyone could afford healthcare, and that is why it wasn't working and why I mentioned the mother drowning her baby analogy. Now, what Republicans actually think they're trying to save from the new healthcare system and what they're actually attempting to do are two different things. They're trying to protect the Employer-based healthcare system in which only the Employer would benefit from it (via a thing in the tax code that gave them a tax break). They think this will be bad for business, and this is what they see that they believe justifies their reasoning. \n\nThe sad truth of this is, technically, yes it *is* \"bad for business\", but not to the extent that it will hurt businesses, it will hurt the businessmen who run these businesses who had these employer-based healthcare systems for these tax benefits. Why? Because it's practically cutting out whats called \"Middle Men\", these middle men are the cause of the previous healthcare problems that made it so bad, because people were being payed off money to provide healthcare to employee's, who were not directly the people who should even be payed for the healthcare in the first place. These middlemen are private insurers which in my opinion is practically a giant scam, because they are taking tax payers money to provide healthcare, when they aren't even the ones who should be payed for the healthcare services.\n\nThere are no real justifications, they just think it's bad for business when it actually is just a better form of business. A comparison to this is how our fossil fuels some day will dry up, and we'll need a newer source of energy and power, which is why it's important to invest in solar and wind power.

I would feel much more comfortable requiring more of new college-entrants if I felt they were better prepared to make those important college decisions. My personal experience, however, has left with me the overwhelming opinion that most college-entrants are not sufficiently prepared. If the end goal for every college student was to put themselves in the best possible position for future employment, then we would have decidedly too many students majoring in \"things they like\" or \"things they're good at\" than \"things that will put some bread on the table\". For kids that have wealth in their family to support them, they have the luxury of taking into account their personal enjoyment.

It's pointless to even try at the moment, all you do is waste time and gain theater points.

You bring me a gun control proposal that starts with de-escalating the militarization of police, and I'll at least hear you out.

I know better then most how bad cops can be. Cops need to be better trained and better educated as well as tightening regulations and increasing transparency. But again we are talking about a special interest group, a highly conservative one at that, the same conservatives that vote for the asses in the Congress that give favors to the Police unions. With that being said, Los Angeles is now one of the safest metropolitan areas in the US, and a lot of it is the very large increase in police numbers. In my opinion, law enforcement officers should serve in a more samaritan capacity, shooting your firearm should be a last resort in conflict resolution.\n\nOn a side note, did you know that the only reason the military cannot be used in a law enforcement capacity within the US is because southern politicians wanted the army to not be there to enforce anti-discrimination laws. Pretty interesting huh?\n\nIn addition, I would like to see a federal office that treats firearms like automobiles; \nregistry\ninsurance\na license for each class of gun \na vigorous mandatory training course focusing on how to safely store the weapon away from children and when it is appropriate to use firearms and outlining non-lethal resolution methods.\nStop the block on the CDC's research on gun violence.\nPay more attention to mental health and increase awareness of it.\nRegulate arms manufacturers so no more stock goes up \"missing.\"\n\nMost of the gun related deaths in this country occur because of accidental firing and crimes of passion, you can't say that we can ignore this any longer.\n\nGuns are tools, but they are being used in the wrong way. Instead of a tool for hunting or hobby, in a lot of cases, they are used as tools to dominate and intimidate.

With good records of where guns come from, and the ability for law enforcement to make sure dealers are following the law we can cut down on *a lot* of illegal gun sales without touching anything close to the second amendment.\n\nI also agree that focusing on assault weapons is maybe a mistake. They account for most of the large mass shootings, but very little of the overall crime and deaths. It's like trying to save lives of travellers by regulating planes and ignoring cars.

Part of the reason some of Americas enemy countries do not dare to invade our country is because of all of the un-enlisted military force we have as citizens.

It's the amendment process. It's hard, and that's on purpose. Because it's very serious business. But you don't just get to brush the Constitution off. And right now, it says \"shall not be infringed.\"\n\nYou are right, but as it stands right now, Republican politicians have their heads so far up their asses, absolutely nothing can get done. It's pointless to even try at the moment, all you do is waste time and gain theater points. I'm not saying we should brush the Constitution aside, but with the kind of deadlock we have right now, people are looking for legal solutions that don't involve a Congress being lobbied by special interests like the NRA and ALEC. No one is saying take all the guns away, I know for sure that will not solve the problem. But we have to give a definition to what \"arms\" include because that is a very broad label.\n\n&gt;So if you want to stop violence, if you want to stop people getting shot, address the actual problem. You bring me a gun control proposal that starts with de-escalating the militarization of police, and I'll at least hear you out. Until then you're just pissing in the wind.\n\nYes, you are right about cops. The expectations of law enforcement needs to be raised. I'm black, I grew up in bad neighborhood on the south side of LA. I know better then most how bad cops can be. Cops need to be better trained and better educated as well as tightening regulations and increasing transparency. But again we are talking about a special interest group, a highly conservative one at that, the same conservatives that vote for the asses in the Congress that give favors to the Police unions. With that being said, Los Angeles is now one of the safest metropolitan areas in the US, and a lot of it is the very large increase in police numbers. In my opinion, law enforcement officers should serve in a more samaritan capacity, shooting your firearm should be a last resort in conflict resolution.\n\nOn a side note, did you know that the only reason the military cannot be used in a law enforcement capacity within the US is because southern politicians wanted the army to not be there to enforce anti-discrimination laws. Pretty interesting huh?\n\nIn addition, I would like to see a federal office that treats firearms like automobiles; \nregistry\ninsurance\na license for each class of gun \na vigorous mandatory training course focusing on how to safely store the weapon away from children and when it is appropriate to use firearms and outlining non-lethal resolution methods.\nStop the block on the CDC's research on gun violence.\nPay more attention to mental health and increase awareness of it.\nRegulate arms manufacturers so no more stock goes up \"missing.\"\n\nMost of the gun related deaths in this country occur because of accidental firing and crimes of passion, you can't say that we can ignore this any longer.\n\nGuns are tools, but they are being used in the wrong way. Instead of a tool for hunting or hobby, in a lot of cases, they are used as tools to dominate and intimidate. This isn't right, no one should have to fear for their life or be afraid while just walking down the street.\n\n&gt;What the fuck. It already happened. You can be disappeared in this country. No trial, no nothin', one day you're there, the next day you're just gone, and it's perfectly legal. The President can order your murder by fiat using flying death robots.

By \"one founding father,\" are you talking about Patrick Henry, George Mason, Samuel Adams, John Adams, Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, or someone I did not name?\n\nYes, as in the context of the federalist papers, #46 was the only one in which James Madison expressed concern about government tyranny through taking away arms.\n\n&gt;There is a mechanism within the charter to do this. It's the amendment process. It's hard, and that's on purpose. Because it's very serious business. But you don't just get to brush the Constitution off. And right now, it says \"shall not be infringed.\"\n\nYou are right, but as it stands right now, Republican politicians have their heads so far up their asses, absolutely nothing can get done. It's pointless to even try at the moment, all you do is waste time and gain theater points. I'm not saying we should brush the Constitution aside, but with the kind of deadlock we have right now, people are looking for legal solutions that don't involve a Congress being lobbied by special interests like the NRA and ALEC. No one is saying take all the guns away, I know for sure that will not solve the problem. But we have to give a definition to what \"arms\" include because that is a very broad label.\n\n&gt;So if you want to stop violence, if you want to stop people getting shot, address the actual problem. You bring me a gun control proposal that starts with de-escalating the militarization of police, and I'll at least hear you out. Until then you're just pissing in the wind.\n\nYes, you are right about cops. The expectations of law enforcement needs to be raised. I'm black, I grew up in bad neighborhood on the south side of LA. I know better then most how bad cops can be. Cops need to be better trained and better educated as well as tightening regulations and increasing transparency. But again we are talking about a special interest group, a highly conservative one at that, the same conservatives that vote for the asses in the Congress that give favors to the Police unions. With that being said, Los Angeles is now one of the safest metropolitan areas in the US, and a lot of it is the very large increase in police numbers. In my opinion, law enforcement officers should serve in a more samaritan capacity, shooting your firearm should be a last resort in conflict resolution.\n\nOn a side note, did you know that the only reason the military cannot be used in a law enforcement capacity within the US is because southern politicians wanted the army to not be there to enforce anti-discrimination laws. Pretty interesting huh?\n\nIn addition, I would like to see a federal office that treats firearms like automobiles; \nregistry\ninsurance\na license for each class of gun \na vigorous mandatory training course focusing on how to safely store the weapon away from children and when it is appropriate to use firearms and outlining non-lethal resolution methods.\nStop the block on the CDC's research on gun violence.\nPay more attention to mental health and increase awareness of it.\nRegulate arms manufacturers so no more stock goes up \"missing.\"\n\nMost of the gun related deaths in this country occur because of accidental firing and crimes of passion, you can't say that we can ignore this any longer.\n\nGuns are tools, but they are being used in the wrong way. Instead of a tool for hunting or hobby, in a lot of cases, they are used as tools to dominate and intimidate. This isn't right, no one should have to fear for their life or be afraid while just walking down the street.\n\n&gt;What the fuck. It already happened. You can be disappeared in this country. No trial, no nothin', one day you're there, the next day you're just gone, and it's perfectly legal. The President can order your murder by fiat using flying death robots.

This isn't 1984, it's 2013, and we're gonna be at war with Eurasia for a mighty long time. We are already there. It happened and we did nothing.\n\nI said it was more *Brave New World* then *1984*, books written very long ago that have frightening similarities to the present. Yes, government power needs to be reigned in, the UAMF needs to be revoked and the Patriot Act needs to disappear. Yes, you are right, we collectively let it happen because we bought into hyperbole and dogmatic ideology. We've let corporations and the wealthiest gain significant power over our elected officials. It is terrible and I hate it, but most people do not give a shit. They are too busy working and scraping by to worry about long term power grabs of the rich and powerful.\n\nBut, there is absolutely no chance of large scale war right now, I will explain it if you wish to continue this but I need a break, my fingers are tired.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18xiy7", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8k0t3v", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361576891", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "buffalo_pete", "id": "t1_c8jre3j", "parent_id": "t1_c8jffmq", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431373385, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18xiy7", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8jre3j", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361548535", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "IBStallion", "id": "t1_c8jffmq", "parent_id": "t1_c8j60uf", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431367709, "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's not a matter of belief, I'm aware of the existence and validity of the passage in question. \n\nIt also involves the second amendment interpretation provided dealing with government tyranny.

A child hates his dad, but his dad still gives a weekly allowance to his child. This is a stable relationship and we, the US want it to stay this way. Meanwhile, we're focusing our attention on the asymmetrical front-- but that's another story.... \n\nAlso, NK is not the biggest \"remaining\" problem from the cold war era. The real problem is when the soviet union disbanded, every country that was banded under them began to slaughter each other for religious, etc reasons. THATS the problem. The cold war era forced MANY countries to fall under the US or the soviet side. \n\n\n--- Disregard everything NK says and take it as \"all bark, no bite\" NK falls in the same group as Iran- both use the \"madman\" tactic to extort money,etc. \n--- Working in politics is not glamorous.

Most of the time, when the North Korean regime makes bellicose statements towards South Korea or the outside world in general, the choice of words in subsequent translations sometimes tends lose the original nuance. For example, the latest outrage over the use of the word \"targeting\" with regards to the US, while perfectly accurate in sentiment, disregards the possible rhetorical connotations of the original wording. Whereas the word used, \"\uaca8\ub0e5\", does mean \"to target/aim at\", it can be construed as meaning \"with [the United States, in this case] in mind.\" Of course, it's more likely that North Korea really is prepared to develop its nuclear technology towards offensive capability against perceived outside aggressors, but I just wanted to make the point that sometimes, nuance gets lost in translation.
