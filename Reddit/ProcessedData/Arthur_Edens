The US Constitution doesn't specifically say who *can* vote; it just gives several reasons that *can't* be used to deny suffrage.  These are: \n\n- Where you're born.  No difference between natural born and naturalized citizens. (14th Amend). \n\n- Race, color, previous status as a slave (15th Amend). \n\n- Sex (19th). \n\n- Residence in Washington D.C. (23rd Amend).\n\n- Failure to pay poll tax (24th Amend). \n\n- Age, 18+ (26th Amend). \n\nNotice that citizenship is not listed as a reason people can't be denied suffrage.  In fact, early in the nation's history, most states allowed non-citizens to vote.  (Ex: \"all men, having sufficient evidence of permanent common interest with, and attachment to, the community, have the right of suffrage.\" *Virginia Bill of Rights*, 1776).\n\nHowever, states started to limit the right of non-citizens to vote in the 1800s, and the last state that allowed non-citizens to vote was Arkansas up until 1926.  Today, **no state allows non-citizens to vote in state elections. In federal elections, it is a crime for a non-citizen to vote or to register to vote.** (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 611. There are actually at least four federal crimes someone would be guilty of if a non-citizen tried to vote, but that's one of them). \n\nAs we've mentioned before, when yo register to vote, you need to enter you're driver's licence number. So, you asked if a state issued ID to a non-citizen would qualify.  The answer to that would be that *ID* would qualify, but the *person* would not.  The DMV notes whether the driver is a citizen when they issue a licence.  When the non-citizen submits that number, it will be cross referenced with the DMV database, as required by HAVA, and it will show that the person is not eligible and has committed four federal crimes.

The US Constitution doesn't specifically say who *can* vote; it just gives several reasons that *can't* be used to deny suffrage.  These are: \n\n- Where you're born.  No difference between natural born and naturalized citizens. (14th Amend). \n\n- Race, color, previous status as a slave (15th Amend). \n\n- Sex (19th). \n\n- Residence in Washington D.C. (23rd Amend).\n\n- Failure to pay poll tax (24th Amend). \n\n- Age, 18+ (26th Amend). \n\nNotice that citizenship is not listed as a reason people can't be denied suffrage.  In fact, early in the nation's history, most states allowed non-citizens to vote.  (Ex: \"all men, having sufficient evidence of permanent common interest with, and attachment to, the community, have the right of suffrage.\" *Virginia Bill of Rights*, 1776).\n\nHowever, states started to limit the right of non-citizens to vote in the 1800s, and the last state that allowed non-citizens to vote was Arkansas up until 1926.  Today, **no state allows non-citizens to vote in state elections. In federal elections, it is a crime for a non-citizen to vote or to register to vote.** (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 611. There are actually at least four federal crimes someone would be guilty of if a non-citizen tried to vote, but that's one of them). \n\nAs we've mentioned before, when yo register to vote, you need to enter you're driver's licence number. So, you asked if a state issued ID to a non-citizen would qualify.  The answer to that would be that *ID* would qualify, but the *person* would not.  The DMV notes whether the driver is a citizen when they issue a licence.  When the non-citizen submits that number, it will be cross referenced with the DMV database, as required by HAVA, and it will show that the person is not eligible and has committed four federal crimes.

The US Constitution doesn't specifically say who *can* vote; it just gives several reasons that *can't* be used to deny suffrage.  These are: \n\n- Where you're born.  No difference between natural born and naturalized citizens. (14th Amend). \n\n- Race, color, previous status as a slave (15th Amend). \n\n- Sex (19th). \n\n- Residence in Washington D.C. (23rd Amend).\n\n- Failure to pay poll tax (24th Amend). \n\n- Age, 18+ (26th Amend). \n\nNotice that citizenship is not listed as a reason people can't be denied suffrage.  In fact, early in the nation's history, most states allowed non-citizens to vote.  (Ex: \"all men, having sufficient evidence of permanent common interest with, and attachment to, the community, have the right of suffrage.\" *Virginia Bill of Rights*, 1776).\n\nHowever, states started to limit the right of non-citizens to vote in the 1800s, and the last state that allowed non-citizens to vote was Arkansas up until 1926.  Today, **no state allows non-citizens to vote in state elections. In federal elections, it is a crime for a non-citizen to vote or to register to vote.** (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 611. There are actually at least four federal crimes someone would be guilty of if a non-citizen tried to vote, but that's one of them). \n\nAs we've mentioned before, when yo register to vote, you need to enter you're driver's licence number. So, you asked if a state issued ID to a non-citizen would qualify.  The answer to that would be that *ID* would qualify, but the *person* would not.  The DMV notes whether the driver is a citizen when they issue a licence.  When the non-citizen submits that number, it will be cross referenced with the DMV database, as required by HAVA, and it will show that the person is not eligible and has committed four federal crimes.

The US Constitution doesn't specifically say who *can* vote; it just gives several reasons that *can't* be used to deny suffrage.  These are: \n\n- Where you're born.

(23rd Amend).\n\n- Failure to pay poll tax (24th Amend). \n\n- Age, 18+ (26th Amend). \n\nNotice that citizenship is not listed as a reason people can't be denied suffrage.  In fact, early in the nation's history, most states allowed non-citizens to vote.  (Ex: \"all men, having sufficient evidence of permanent common interest with, and attachment to, the community, have the right of suffrage.\" *Virginia Bill of Rights*, 1776).\n\nHowever, states started to limit the right of non-citizens to vote in the 1800s, and the last state that allowed non-citizens to vote was Arkansas up until 1926.  Today, **no state allows non-citizens to vote in state elections. In federal elections, it is a crime for a non-citizen to vote or to register to vote.** (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 611.

So, you asked if a state issued ID to a non-citizen would qualify.  The answer to that would be that *ID* would qualify, but the *person* would not.  The DMV notes whether the driver is a citizen when they issue a licence.  When the non-citizen submits that number, it will be cross referenced with the DMV database, as required by HAVA, and it will show that the person is not eligible and has committed four federal crimes.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1qzuts", "selftext": "It sounds like you're asking why it's not unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause.  \n\nThe Equal Protection Clause doesn't say the government has to treat everyone the same, just that everyone has to receive, you guessed it, equal protection.  Under the EPC, different classifications are treated with different levels of scrutiny.  Race, for example, is treated with what's called \"strict scrutiny\" because the courts have said it's  a \"suspect class\" (i.e., lots of people have unfairly discriminated based on race in the past).  That means that if the government is going to treat people differently based on their race, it has to have a \"compelling government interest\" in doing so.  This is a pretty high standard.  A rare time when the standard was actually met was in *Korematsu v. United States*, where SCOTUS OK'd the army rounding up Japanese Americans during WWII.  It probably wouldn't make the same decision today... \n\nSex receives \"intermediate scrutiny,\" which is a step below strict scrutiny.  Age isn't considered a suspect class, so it receives \"rational basis review.\"  That just means that in order for the govnerment to discriminate based on race, it has to be able to articulate a rational basis for why it's doing so.  The rational basis for Medicare is that it's hard for old people to buy private insurance.  That's enough to pass the constitutionality test.  \n\n\n**TLDR Equal Protection Chart.**\n\n\n\n|Classification   | Standard of Review    | Government Interest   |\n|:-----------|:------------:|:------------:|\n|Race        | Strict Scrutiny |     \"Does the gov't have a damn good reason for doing this?\"    \n| Sex  |    Intermediate Scrutiny|  \"Does the gov't have a pretty good reason for doing this?\" \n| Age, hair color, etc. | Rational Basis Review|   \"Is there a conceivable, rational reason why the gov't would do this?\"", "id": "t1_cdi6vlr", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Arthur_Edens", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1qzuts", "selftext": "Well, don't forget \"Rational basis with bite\"!", "id": "t1_cdiafj5", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "blackbird17k", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I skipped a lot of nuance in this answer to try to avoid putting people to sleep :p.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1oksdt", "selftext": "I would agree with most of what you said, but my initial point still stands; the system is antiquated.  \n\nA few nitpicks: \n\n&gt; The House of Representatives is where you see proportional representation.\n\nThe House is no where near proportional representation.  It's still geographic districts; the districts are just smaller than the states.  I say this is antiquated because we're no longer divided mainly by geography; it actually plays a pretty small role in our political affiliations.  Someone who lives in Greensboro, NC is likely going to identify politically a lot more with someone who lives in San Francisco than someone who lives just down the road in Elizabeth City.  \n\n&gt; In the Senate, the identical representation means that smaller states will be able to prevent larger states from banding together in the House and pass laws that disproportionately affect smaller states.\n\nThis was the intention, but modernly, it's not really relevant.  There are very few political questions we face *today* where Texas, New York, Florida and California are going to be ganging up to harm Nebraska and Rhode Island.  Today's majorities and minorities break down along socioeconomic lines, not geographic lines, and constitutional guarantees are more effective ways of protecting those minorities than geographic representation.\n\n&gt;This is all due to the fact that while the US is a single nation, it in fact is divided into 50 separate states that were relatively autonomous. \n\nThe states are still much more than provinces, but their roles have changed dramatically since our system was founded.  I wouldn't say they're less powerful, just different.  While state politics don't get as much attention as national politics, state governments still interact with citizens on a daily basis much more frequently than the national government.  \n\nAmericans no longer identify by their state first.  I'm not a Nebraskan who lives in the US... I'm an American currently living in Nebraska.  We're no longer divided along state lines like we used to be (see above, regarding proportional representation).  Today, we're divided along socioeconomic lines, including a rural/urban division.  \n\nI may not have expressed this well in my first post, but we would be better represented by a parliament elected through a proportional representation system.  Start from scratch. Eliminate the senate and house, create two new houses: The first, similar to the House of Commons in the UK.  Have a general election where people vote for a *party*.

People are self-segregating, isolating themselves into political echo chambers.  It isn't just a phenomenon in how people consume news/media, it's a physical one too - people move to where they can more readily identify with the people around them, a feat only recently becoming possible due to things like telecommunication and spreading economic infrastructure (\"globalization\" in a much more confined sense).  And thus pockets of area become homogenized.  The larger (population-wise and area-wise) a place gets, the less an effect localized homogenizing has.  So that means a state is then more likely to have breeding grounds for a \"tyranny of the majority\" than a nation as a whole (because I don't think the \"quantum leap\" has been made yet to make trans-national border crossing as feasible as the trend I'm describing here).  \n\n\\*I really hate the term \"tyranny of the majority.\"  People overuse it and assume it is equivalent to \"majority rule.\"  It is not.

Your quote is the argument for representative government.  It doesn't really have to do with how those representatives are elected.  \n\n&gt; Even if you feel you're an American who happens to live in Nebraska, certainly your state legislature has some vested interest in maintaining power. And in turn that power is good for you as a Nebraskan. How many jobs around you are funded by federal money? How many miles of highway are we all paying for in Nebraska?\n\nWell, yes, there's an interest.  But there was an interest for men to retain sole voting power in the early 1900s, too.  Just because you have a power doesn't mean it's right.  \n\nYou're absolutely right that Nebraska, like most rural states, is a 'taker' state.  But I don't think that's because of our unequally large representation in the EC or the Senate.  \n\nSorry if this is ranty, but quick story: One summer when I was working through undergrad, I got a temp job with the engineering section of the Dept. of Roads.  We were building a pretty impressive double highway overpass over a river and rail-line in the middle of nowhere; Two overpasses and a horseshoe turn, which cost millions of (mostly federal) dollars.  The town where this overpass was built had 130 people.  \n\nI was having lunch in my safety vest at the local cafe one morning, and one of the locals pointed out how absurd he thought it was that the state was wasting money on such an expensive project when no one in the town even wanted it.  He looked a little taken aback when I told him the overpass wasn't for the people in his town; it was for the trucks driving from Texas to Canada.  The rail crossing was unsafe for the oversized trailers.  \n\nMost of the federal investments in Nebraska follow this pattern.  I-80 exists so that people can drive from Chicago to Denver, not to bolster our economy. It happens to have the happy effect of helping our economy, but that's not its primary function.  \n\n&gt; PR is an interesting idea and I think it has a good chance of moving forward.\n\nA guy can dream, right? :p", "id": "t1_cc0vo9k", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Arthur_Edens", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cc0trfc", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429605077, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cc0vo9k", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1378219410", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}
{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1lli3f", "selftext": "&gt; By being too close to popular passions we open our government up to making more decisions motivated by prejudice and other bad things as defined by a Rationalistic framework.\n\nSome parts of the founders' philosophy on government still ring true.  This is one part that doesn't. Politicians have their fingers directly on the pulse of what it takes to win; modern polling and statistics can see through the veil of the EC.  That means it doesn't serve the purpose of preventing close ties to \"popular passions.\" Rather, it just means the only people whose passions matter are those in Iowa/New Hampshire, and those in the ten or so battleground states.   \n\n&gt;Second, giving over sized power to smaller states was also intentional.\n\nAt the time it was, of course.  There were 13 different nations forming one.  However, much like Greece is no longer a loose coalition of warring city-states, the United States is no longer a disparate group of mini-nations held together to resist European Domination.  Most of the modern states (35, I believe) have never existed as independent nations.  Therefore, most of us don't hold primary allegiance to our states anymore.  I'm an American who lives in Nebraska, not the other way around.  \n\n&gt;why would citizens of Wyoming, say, consent to live in a country where, essentially, the people of NY, CA, TX, and PA get to decide the next President?\n\nThat's a stacked questions, similar to saying \"why would men want women to vote, when that would only dilute their representation\" in 1900.   Wyoming has never lived independently of the United States, and it would suffer greatly if it left.  It only has a greater vote than 'one man, one vote' because of the archaic system.  It, and people like me in Nebraska, which also has more than its fair share of the vote, should give it up because it's the right thing to do, and it will give more legitimacy to the system.  \n\n&gt;there wasn't any discussion of PR (as modern electoral political science understands it) back at the Founding.\n\nNo, there wasn't, because the system is more modern than the founding (about 1840).  I didn't mean to say the founders were idiots for coming up with the system they did; to the contrary, it was very well suited for their time. However, wagons are no longer the best way to get from Philadelphia to New York, and the EC is no longer the best electoral system.  \n\nLike you said, they didn't predict how permanent political parties would become, but they're here to stay.  I don't really think that's a bad thing.  Honestly, I wish our system was more focused on parties and less on individuals.  With the focus being on individuals, discussions on politics often are hard to differentiate from tabloids.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; I'm not sure why the popular vote started being counted in the first place. \n\nThey're counted at the state level because a majority is required to determine that state's delegates.  Exact figures, (rather than just saying 'A got more than B') provides more legitimacy to the election.  As soon as you have the popular vote from 50 states publically reported, it's not much more work to add them together to get the national total. \n\n&gt;Are we really so committed to democratic norms?\n\nThis is actually exactly why some people (including myself) think the electoral college is ridiculous.  In a world with instantaneous communication, it makes absolutely no sense.  If you were to go into your room today and create a voting system from scratch, you would never come up with an idea like the EC.  \n\nRepresentative Democracies are built on the principle that each citizen's vote as to whom should be in charge is as valuable as the next. However, the EC doesn't take that view at all.  With the EC, Wyoming gets one vote for every 177,556 people.  However, California gets one vote for every 668,556 people!  A vote in Wyoming is nearly 4 times as powerful as a vote in California.\n\nIf we were to rewrite the Constitution today, I suspect we would make at least the following changes to the electoral system: \n\n1) Presidents would be elected by national popular vote. \n\n2) Congressional seats would be apportioned through a proportional representation system.  \n\nThese changes would free us from the ridiculous geographic constraints the Constitution places on us and allow seats to be allotted based on how many people agree with that ideology, rather than winner take all geographic systems which sometimes get kind of close to the make up of the country.

That means it doesn't serve the purpose of preventing close ties to \"popular passions.\" Rather, it just means the only people whose passions matter are those in Iowa/New Hampshire, and those in the ten or so battleground states.   \n\n&gt;Second, giving over sized power to smaller states was also intentional.\n\nAt the time it was, of course.  There were 13 different nations forming one.  However, much like Greece is no longer a loose coalition of warring city-states, the United States is no longer a disparate group of mini-nations held together to resist European Domination.  Most of the modern states (35, I believe) have never existed as independent nations.  Therefore, most of us don't hold primary allegiance to our states anymore.

Wyoming has never lived independently of the United States, and it would suffer greatly if it left.  It only has a greater vote than 'one man, one vote' because of the archaic system.  It, and people like me in Nebraska, which also has more than its fair share of the vote, should give it up because it's the right thing to do, and it will give more legitimacy to the system.  \n\n&gt;there wasn't any discussion of PR (as modern electoral political science understands it) back at the Founding.\n\nNo, there wasn't, because the system is more modern than the founding (about 1840).

The candidates still get the same share of the votes in that state.  \n\nThis makes for an odd electoral system, because IIRC, it's mathematically possible for a candidate to win only ~35% of the *national* popular vote, but still win the presidency.

As soon as you have the popular vote from 50 states publically reported, it's not much more work to add them together to get the national total. \n\n&gt;Are we really so committed to democratic norms?\n\nThis is actually exactly why some people (including myself) think the electoral college is ridiculous.  In a world with instantaneous communication, it makes absolutely no sense.  If you were to go into your room today and create a voting system from scratch, you would never come up with an idea like the EC.  \n\nRepresentative Democracies are built on the principle that each citizen's vote as to whom should be in charge is as valuable as the next. However, the EC doesn't take that view at all.  With the EC, Wyoming gets one vote for every 177,556 people.  However, California gets one vote for every 668,556 people!  A vote in Wyoming is nearly 4 times as powerful as a vote in California.\n\nIf we were to rewrite the Constitution today, I suspect we would make at least the following changes to the electoral system: \n\n1) Presidents would be elected by national popular vote. \n\n2) Congressional seats would be apportioned through a proportional representation system.  \n\nThese changes would free us from the ridiculous geographic constraints the Constitution places on us and allow seats to be allotted based on how many people agree with that ideology, rather than winner take all geographic systems which sometimes get kind of close to the make up of the country.

Wyoming has never lived independently of the United States, and it would suffer greatly if it left.  It only has a greater vote than 'one man, one vote' because of the archaic system.

We were building a pretty impressive double highway overpass over a river and rail-line in the middle of nowhere; Two overpasses and a horseshoe turn, which cost millions of (mostly federal) dollars.  The town where this overpass was built had 130 people.  \n\nI was having lunch in my safety vest at the local cafe one morning, and one of the locals pointed out how absurd he thought it was that the state was wasting money on such an expensive project when no one in the town even wanted it.  He looked a little taken aback when I told him the overpass wasn't for the people in his town; it was for the trucks driving from Texas to Canada.  The rail crossing was unsafe for the oversized trailers.  \n\nMost of the federal investments in Nebraska follow this pattern.  I-80 exists so that people can drive from Chicago to Denver, not to bolster our economy.
