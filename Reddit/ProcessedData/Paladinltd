Pesticides cause environmental damage. I'm not a scientist, I'm a lurker in that sort of discussion, but something that encourages the use of more pesticides, I think, is bad in principal. \n\n2) The companies that make GMOs are assholes. Very repressive policies that limit farmers. Monsanto, Syrgenta, DOW, just don't deserve the power they have.  I'd oppose their business out of principal even if the technology isn't a bad idea.\n\nThe only real issue that's ever been brought to the mainstream concerning GMOs- as far as I can tell- is labeling. I don't understand at all why it is even a controversy. Ingredients are already labeled. Most people concerned about GMOs are equally or more concerned about high-fructose corn syrup.  Even *if* you claim that unfounded fears of GMOs would drive down the sale of Nestle foods or something- why is that anyone's problem? If people want to play amateur scientist, listen to naturalnews and boycott GMOs, they'll still probably stay in the fringe of things. \n\nIn any event, from majority of 'naturalist' (using that term incorrectly on purpose) websites have a right-wing slang if they have a political slant at all. The march against Monsanto was organized by right-wing libertarians. The general argument from opposition isn't to regulate them to death, it's to 'vote with your dollar'.

That is the debate you are up against, so you need to build a coherent response. You can't simply shoot down (pardon the pun) every single suggestion because in the end politicians will say \"fuck it, forget compromise\", and next thing you know they ban more than assault weapons.\n\nThis is my point, it has nothing to do with the rights and wrongs of gun control, it is purely a political strategy.\n\nSo back to my \"think of the children point\". Firstly, it's a trite comparison. Reducing speed on all roads to 5mph would cripple America, introducing background checks for guns is a minor inconvenience. And forget whether or not it is effective, it is what your opponents are demanding, so why not concede it? You are going to have to concede something, a background check is minor in the spectrum of things they could demand. A mild inconvenience in return for retaining gun ownership, and at the same time potentially keeping the guns out of the hands of some who shouldn't have them.\n\n&gt;More Americans want to have universal background checks. Does that alone make it right? Does that make it useful?\n\nNo! Tyranny of the majority is a real thing. But it's such a small concession that it is political stupidity to rail against it. The tide in America is currently moving towards \"something\" being done, why not get involved and allow small concessions in return for a cast-iron guarantee to your right to bear arms? You are right about the purpose of the 2nd amendment. If it is truly to protect yourself against the government, it is useless as those supersonic jets and heavily armored tanks will devastate you. Have it re-written so that it clearly allows personal ownership for recreational, and self-defence use. Get it in the constitution and you'll never lose it.\n\nThat will never happen if you stand against everything suggested.

Don't make use the argument of \"Think of the children\".\n\n&gt;I could find more which at least show Americans want something done\n\nOkay. For conversations sake, I will concede the point. More Americans want to have universal background checks. Does that alone make it right? Does that make it useful? For example various polls will show people, sometimes the majority, will want an assault weapons ban. Okay, but \"assault weapons\" only comprise less than 2% of all gun crime.

Firstly CBS is notoriously skewed in all of their firearm news coverage and reporting.

Teo, this is a misleading question. This question does not pertain to how the laws will be written. When you ask this question, people immediately think about purchasing a new gun from a store or dealer. How about when a grandpa wants to give his son or grandson a firearm? He will have to have a background check for this. This is absurd to me. I personally purchased a .22 rifle for my sister when she turned 10 and will give it to her on her 18th birthday as a gift. Your telling me that I will have to go to a dealer to have my own sister's background be checked when I have lived with her, basically raising her? This is doubly absurd.\n\nA less biased question would be, \"Do you support universal background checks for transfers of firearms, even between family?\"\n\nThis is the struggle of surveys. Who you ask and how you ask. I can tell you that my circle is not in the (significant) minority (even if 40%, I'm not calling that the \"minority\").\n\nTo elaborate, what many polling/survey will do is pre-screen the call. Before they ask about universal background checks, they will ask questions like, how knowledgeable are you about firearms 1-5, 5 being strong knowledge. Or do you personally own a firearm? Or Have you ever shot a gun? Then after you are prescreened like this, they will begine the survey. If they don't like your pre-screen answers they will say thank you for your time.

Of the ten parties, and one independent, who won seats in the 2010 election, seven of them were regionalist parties from Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland (the independent was a sitting MP formerly of the regionalist Ulster Union party). This has occurred (historically) in the US as well, the best example being the 1948 presidential election when the southern Dixiecrats were able to win 4 states.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind about the 2010 UK general election was the anti-establishment mood in the country at that time. Due to public dissatisfaction with the Iraq war and the perceived incompetence of the leadership, many voters shied away from voting Labour. However, voters who generally would have voted for Labour had no desire to vote Conservative, and many therefore chose to vote third party instead. This too, has historical precedent in the US, during the 1992 presidential election many voters chose to cast their vote for third party candidate Ross Perot rather than either of the two establishment candidates.\n\nLastly, I believe tradition plays at least a small part in the continued support for Liberal Democrats. A key factor in a persons political thought is the political tradition in which they were raised. Considering that the Lib-Dems are descended from the once powerful Liberal Party it stands to reason that loyalty to the liberal tradition would be passed down the generations.\n\nAll of this, of course, is speculation on my part. I'm just an observant outsider to UK politics, so if any Britons found issue with my reasoning please let me know!", "id": "t1_c897x7p", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Paladinltd", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_17vf8r", "selftext": "&gt; the one thing that will always trump Duverger's law, is regionalism.\n\nTo clarify, regionalism doesn't necessarily trump Duverger's Law. In smaller regions, two parties still dominate. Those two parties, however, do not need to be the same as two dominant parties elsewhere. Duverger's Law doesn't claim that when two parties dominate those same parties dominate universally.

You can literally have the same weapon, but a body kit on one, and the one with the body kit suddenly is illegal.  Further, outlawing guns by name is foolish as they will discontinue that line and introduce another gun, slightly modified, to get around the ban - just as they did the first time.\n\nThe ammo limitation is the only that bothers me the most, though, especially because it exempts police.  You would think that they would need fewer rounds per \"engagement\" that a private citizen considering their training and required practice.  If a woman is backed into a corner by two men, you might very well need more than 10 rounds to stop both of them - even assuming a 50% accuracy, that's only 2-3 hits on each person.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_17nky0", "selftext": "In order to save the good people of this subreddit from having to watch this appalling I'm going to go through this video point by point to deconstruct their assertions.\n\n* The first clip is apparently of a gentlemen, apparently one of the dead children's grandfather. He's explaining the events while very clearly distraught over the loss of his grandchild, and apparently he made some comments that he would contradict in later interviews. \n\nMemory is a funny thing, and it tends to shift and bend over time, which is why eyewitness testimony is so often disregarded in a court of law. The man, clearly distressed at the loss of a close family member, was making statements only a few hours after the shooting occurred, and in his distressed state made a few statements that contradicted the official story.\n\n* The video makes the claim that, due to neighbors not interacting with the shooter for several years, he had been dead for at least three years. \n\nOf course a more parsimonious and simpler explanation is that the shooter was a mentally disturbed and extremely depressed individual who chose not to interact with neighbors, but of course that wouldn't fit with the bizarre conspiratorial paradigm.\n\n* The video then asserts that all of the victims families, their classmates and the teachers are all actors, based on a few clips of interviews of people behaving in a manner that doesn't meet the video makers standard of proper mourning.\n\nRather than point out the massive cherry picking this demonstrates, or the fact that people act differently in face of tragedy, I'll just say that this conspiracy is absolutely *massive*. Hundreds of actors are now being utilized to spread a massive and fraudulent stories, and will likely have to do so for the rest of their lives. I sure hope their being paid millions of dollars to keep their mouth shut, because if even just one of them wanted to blab, they'd make a ton of cash from exposing the conspiracy.\n\n* Clip 4 asserts that there was evidence of more than one shooter based on eyewitness testimony and confusion on the part of the police.\n\nClearly this person has never worked for the police, but I have. When a crime occurs, especially a big one like this with lots of eyewitnesses, you have to follow up all reports at face value. If one of the survivors thinks he saw a second gunman, you have to follow that lead in case it's factual. Most such reports will lead to nothing, simply being thrown out there due to the confusion of the situation. \n\n* In the same clip, the video asserts that their is a conspiracy about the number of guns used by the shooter. A medical examiner also stated that a bushmaster rifle was used for the majority of the shootings when the rifle was apparently in the trunk of the shooters car.\n\nThe bushmaster rifle *was* used the majority of shootings. The weapon found in the trunk of the car was a shotgun.\n\n* In the next clip presents media confusion about the shooter's mother's connection to the School as evidence, which she was not. One reporter claims in talking to the school nurse, she said the shooters mother was a wonderful teacher. In searching online for the name of the school nurse the maker of the video found nothing about her.\n\nIn the aftermath of the shooting their was a great deal of confusion, as there always is with such tragedies. By the day after the shooting the media had clarified the confusion. The video takes a second hand report at absolute face value, rather than bad reporting. And apparently my [google-fu](http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/newtown-connecticut-school-shooting-sandy-hook-nurse-hid-17997111) is superior.\n\n* One of the victims, a young girl, was apparently alive appearing in a photo with President Obama when he visited Newtown.\n\nApparently all white girls look alike to the maker of this video. The girl in the photo was the victims younger sister.\n\n* This is basically a bunch of cherry-picked clips of interviews that remove context in order to assert a claim. It's not even really worth going over, but shows the apparent moral bankruptcy of the video maker\n\n* This clip brings up that FEMA and the department of Homeland Security was offering a course on \"Planning for the needs of children in a disaster\"\n\nthe state run Connecticut Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security was offering such FEMA courses to various schools throughout [November](http://www.ct.gov/demhs/ical/calendar.asp?mm=11&amp;yyyy=2012&amp;image1.x=18&amp;image1.y=12&amp;calendar_ID=0&amp;showTop=True) and [December](http://www.ct.gov/demhs/ical/calendar.asp?mm=12&amp;yyyy=2012&amp;image1.x=17&amp;image1.y=14&amp;calendar_ID=0&amp;showTop=True). Clearly emergency preparedness is sinister.\n\n* The videos final and most urgent piece of evidence is that Facebook memorials were put up days before the shooting occurred. According to the video there is no explanation beyond a conspiracy and is the the smoking gun.\n\nThe explanation is fairly obvious to anyone with a basic understanding of websites. Backdating is fairly easy to do, and earlier posts on Facebook can be re-purposed. Doing a date-restricted search on anything, for our purpose I'll use the [abdication of queen Beatrix of the Netherlands](https://www.google.com/search?q=queen+beatrix+abdication&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=635&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ugkLUeayG-iy0QHSxIHQDw&amp;ved=0CB4QpwUoBg&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1%2F1%2F2013%2Ccd_max%3A11%2F25%2F2012&amp;tbm=) brings up similar results\n\n**TL;DR: This video crushed my faith in humanity for the day.

My faith in humanity is restored to pre-conspiracy video levels (although I don't count whoever created this reprehensible video as included a part of said humanity).\n\nI had started looking into a lot of these details myself, with an already suspicious mind (as far as the video was concerned). Much of the contradicting interviews I had already put down to the unreliability of memory.\n\nI think (as the creator had intended), the only part that gave me pause were the items at the end of the piece (the FEMA website, and the Victim Fund websites). The explanation about the FEMA preparedness makes sense. Of course if you dig around enough, you will find coincidences that people could claim as \"suspicious\". (Who would have thought... the government agency responsible for disaster response would regularly hold events to prepare for disaster response!!)\n\nI'd like to see the actual explanation about the victim fund website being supposedly created a day before the shooting. It is *highly* unlikely that this would be the case, even in the event of a hoax. It is so easy for a server time-zone to be out, or a client-side browser having the wrong time/date set during article creation (I develop websites myself, so I know how easy it is for such a bug to creep into client-side javascript). (You can actually see the website they refer to in the Web Archive, [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130107101848/http://www.gofundme.com/sandy-hook-victims-fund) if anyone isn't sure what I'm referring to).\n\nThe guess simple fact is, if people fund enough \"every day\" website errors, and confused interview statements, and 'initially inconsistent' police reports, then once compiled into a video they can scream conspiracy.\n\nAs I said, I was already highly skeptical of this video, but I wanted to hear other people's opinions and debunkings, which you have certainly provided.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_175293", "selftext": "I think when most people hear the words \"rewrite the constitution\" they imagine the worst case scenario: a radical changing of the system as we have known it for the past 230 years. I've had people, upon my bringing up the idea of writing a new constitution, accuse me of hating the bill of rights and demand to know why I want to rewrite or do away with freedom of speech, as though the new document . It's understandable to a certain degree; the current configuration of the government has served us well more or less for the two centuries and as people will say, the constitution provides for ways to amend it. The problem I have is that the amendment process is incredibly slow, uneven, and increasingly undemocratic as the discrepancy in state population explodes, meaning that the older the constitution becomes, the more resistant to change it becomes.\n\nLikewise, I think many people feel that our current constitution is an important key to our founding myth. Our Founding Fathers, after casting off the chains of the tyrannical British, came together in a room in Philadelphia and effectively invented modern liberal democracy. Doing away with the current constitution would feel to a lot of people like a slap in the face of our forefathers.\n\nLastly, a frequent refrain I hear whenever this topic is \"can you imagine today's politicians writing the constitution?\" I find this to be a weak argument that ignores the original manner in which the constitution was written. The constitution wasn't written by Congress of the Confederation, it was written in secret by a group of people appointed by the states for their expertise, and ratification required the approval of two-thirds of the states. A new constitutional convention would likely be conducted in a similar manner.", "id": "t1_c82ds2e", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Paladinltd", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_175293", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431058175, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c82ds2e", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1358981929", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_15yzxq", "selftext": "Is the Government broken? Yes. Is it irreparably broken, that is to say broken in such a manner as to never properly work again? No. In the course of the next decade or so the ideologues will die out, be voted out, or marginalized into irrelevancy, and things will go back to a certain amount of normalcy. \n\nThat isn't to say the current situation demonstrates the inherent flaws in the system that require fixing. This is my list of what I see as the biggest flaws, and solutions I believe could work:\n\n**Electoral Methods** - We currently use First-past-the-post voting, with  single member electoral districts for the House and the electoral college that elects the President. The problem with all of these is the force political thought to polarize, resulting in the two party system we see today.\n\nThe Solution is to change to more modern methods of voting. For the House, eliminate single-member districts and move to a proportional method, where parties get seats according to the amount of votes cast for them. For Senate and Presidential elections (the electoral college being done away with), I favor a two-round method using approval voting, where first an election is held where multiple candidates regardless of political affiliation compete. If a candidate is the highest over a certain threshold, let's say 50% they win. If no candidate is over the threshold, or the leading runners are close, say below 5% of each other, a second election is held where the top two candidates compete head to head. This would eliminate partisan primaries and expand the amount of political opinion competing in elections.\n\n**Poor Representation** - Around 1930, the number of Representatives in the house was fixed at 435. At the time the amount of voters per Representatives was around 200,000. The problem is that the US population has expanded by 300% while the amount of Representatives remain the same, leading to Voter per Representative ratio of around 700,000, the highest in the western world.\n\nThe Solution is simple: add more representatives, and ensure that the number of representatives grows with the population. Anywhere between 1,000 to 2,000 Representatives would put us on par with the ratio that we had in 1930. I'd also expand the number of Senators per state to three.\n\n**Executive excess** - Constitution ambiguity concerning the executive office and lack of courage in Congress has allowed over the past century or so an expanse in Presidential power far in excess of what should be permissible. Military adventurism, drone strikes, and unchecked spying  both at home and abroad are a just a few of the problems that this negligence allows.\n\nTo solve this, the constitution should be amended or rewritten to clarify the amount of unilateral power the President has, expand congressional oversight of executive departments and limit or prohibit the use of military action without a congressional deceleration of war.\n\nThis list isn't exhaustive, but it's the problems that I feel to be most obvious and that will definitely require fixing in the near future.\n\nTL;DR: wall of text.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "If you don't mind, our arguments seem to circle themselves and be repeated a lot, so for the sake of simplicity I've boiled your basic points down to bullet points. If I've missed anything or you feel I've misrepresented your point just say so and I'll answer them or amend the post as it requires.\n\n* no law could be made which distinguished the rights of a citizen over that of a disenfranchised civilian. They are equal before the law.\n\nThe law, by having a franchised and disfranchised class, already makes a distinction. If the state passes laws that affects the both classes, but only the citizens have the ability to affect those laws, then the only protection that civilians have from abuse by the state is the whim of the enfranchised. History demonstrates that rule by minority always leads to abuse.\n\n* Why is sovereign franchise a right?\n\nBecause consent is a right. \n\nWhy should the state be allowed to tax me and spend the money as it see fit, or pass laws that limit my conduct but the only means to alter the state is through indentured servitude to it? Not to slide down the slippery slope, but this question can be taken: can the state demand a kidney from  me without my consent? Or my life? Or my first born child? My question is: why are people inherently undeserving of sovereign franchise such that they have to jump through hoops to get it?\n\n*  Anyone who desires franchise can get it.\n\nHere's my problem with that: by requiring service to the state as a path to enfranchisement you're essentially placing your philosophical view of the state above all others. What if I'm a libertarian or anarchist, and I view the state and rendering service to it repugnant? Or what if such service is against my religious views? What if I'm a believer in states rights over that of the federal government? What if I'm a pacifist, and believe the state is violent war machine that should be stopped, peacefully? What if I have a once in lifetime job offer right out of school that I need to take immediately or it'll slip away? What if I just don't want to? The real question is why is your view of government inherently superior to all the foregoing?\n\n* Service to the collective is not service to the State. Everyone contributes to the collective, but as far as I can see, only some people who desire franchise would contribute to the state.\n\nI agree with your point that service to the collective is not service to the State, but in a free and fair society the State serves at the behest of the collective's will. How can the State serve the collective will if the collective's ability to affect the State is limited? If State will pass laws that will affect everyone, regardless of services rendered to the state, everyone so affected should have a say in those laws.\n\n* Below you quote that \"all men are created equal\". In this case, how does modern day America ensure the same?\n\nAll power flows from the ballot box. All laws are made by legislatures elected by the peoples wills. Those laws are enforced by the executive branch elected in much the same way. Judges, who arbitrate the laws, are appointed by the elected executive and approved by the elected legislature. In order to be convicted in a court of law, both criminal and civil, the consent of a jury of our peers is required. This is why the right to suffrage is so vital; it's the best guarantee of a free society.\n\n* You also mention how a person's taxes could be used to provide evidence of a person's stake in the state. These taxes are indistinguishable between citizens and civilians, and provide for the safety and well-being of the collective through the state. I guess I just do not see how this contributes to a person's franchise.\n\nThe answer to this is simple, as it's codified in our founding mythology - no taxation without representation. Our forefathers shed blood for that notion, why do we deserve any less?\n\nAs to the Heinlein Not_a_Zaku answered it perfectly.

The only protection that civilians have from abuse by the state is the whim of the enfranchised.\n\nMy only response to this is please demonstrate a situation where a law could be written which negatively impacts a civilian disproportionately to a citizen.

Why someone who is born into a society they disagree with have more rights than someone who was not born into it, but wishes to join? Everyone in this proposed society has a choice to tolerate the society they were born into, or contribute to it, and change it. Recall there is no limitation on freedom of speech, and I could see civilians voicing their opinion very loudly, but if they truly cared about voicing their opinion, why would they not put something into the system and actually add their voice to the vote? \n\n* What if I conscientiously object to the actions of the state? Why should I have to contribute to it, in effect support it, in order to change it?\n\nThis comes down to my previous statement. Why should being born into a society grant you rights to remain over someone who was not, and wants to join? If the objector cannot tolerate the state enough to put in his stake by service, but he can tolerate it enough to hang around and enjoy the benefits of the society he was born into, then he is free to. If he cannot tolerate it enough to serve and earn his franchise, and he cannot tolerate it enough to abide its laws, why should he remain a part of the society? This is the central tenet of this government.\n\n* If State will pass laws that will affect everyone, regardless of services rendered to the state, everyone so affected should have a say in those laws.\n\nI would qualify that statement with \"everyone so affected should have **the ability to** have a say in those laws.\" Why should subjecting yourself to a the laws of a society immediately qualify you to modify those laws? Why should you not first have to demonstrate that you have something vested in the society before you come in and change all of the rules? Notice that to me, \"coming in\" to a society includes being born into it. \n\n* All power flows from the ballot box. All of our elected officials are appointed by ballot. This is why the right to suffrage is so vital; it's the best guarantee of a free society.\n\nI could not agree more, except that the right to suffrage is not a right, but a privilege to earned. This argument went very circular.\n\n* The answer to this is simple, as it's codified in our founding mythology - no taxation without representation. **Our forefathers shed blood for that notion**, why do we deserve any less?\n\nOur forefathers shed blood for that notion. They wanted to be represented and put their lives on the line to earn that representation. Why do we do any less? \n\n* \"That to secure these rights (Life, Liberty, and Pursuit of Happiness), Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\"\n\nBy subjecting themselves to being governed, the governed give their consent. Again, if the disenfranchised do not care enough to contribute and gain their franchise, regardless of their own views, but can tolerate being a part of the society, they are very free to do so. But if they do not care enough to contribute and gain their franchise, and cannot tolerate the laws of the society they are knowingly living within, why should they be themselves tolerated?", "edited": 1357515704, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7s7s52", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357509685", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c7ro23w", "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1430876960, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_160ijy", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7s6uao", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357506893", "ups": 4, "distinguished": null}

The fascist pseudo-Nazi government you see in that film is only vaguely reminiscent of the meritocratic democracy portrayed in the book.\n\nI disagree. The movie provides excellent demonstration of the flaws inherent to the system outlined in the book. If ultimate power is derived from the State, and the State limits enfranchisement to the minority of elite few who provide service to itself, what would prevent the State from transforming from a meritocracy to an oligarchy, or an aristocracy? \n\n&gt;The system mirrors America\u2019s currently in that is an open democracy, with the right to earn franchise not limited to anyone based on creed, color, sex, etc.\n\nIncorrect. Barriers to enfranchisement are inherently undemocratic and illiberal. No one should have to 'earn' the right to vote, any more then anyone should have to earn any other right. A system where inequality is inherent can hardly be called open or free.\n\n&gt;This theme of responsibility tempering authority is one which resonated with me.\n\nThat's understandable. We want those with power to have the responsibility to use wisely. But limiting power to a select few is not the means to achieve this. The British monarchy had a responsibility to their American colonies, and unlimited power over the disenfranchised citizens of those colonies. Without recourse to protect against those abuses, the Americans did the only thing the felt they could do: rebel, violently.\n\n&gt;We allow ourselves to be governed by the whim of a public who has no stake in the collective.\n\nThe State is not the collective, and service to the State is not the only means of have a stake in the collective. A citizen, whose enfranchisement is a birthright, lives in a place, paying property taxes which goes towards the education of children. They work and in working, beyond providing goods and services to the pubic, pay payroll and income taxes which go towards the payment of services both federal and state. In registering to vote, they are required to serve jury duty when requested and, if they are male at least, to sign up for conscription in case of a war. Why is this insufficient? How does a doctor, serving outside the state, not provide a service to the collective? Or for that matter a dockworker, a trash collector, or fast food cashier?\n\n&gt;Did not our founding fathers intend to allow only those who owned property and therefore had a vested stake in the community to exercise franchise? \n\nAnd by allowing an arbitrary definition of who has a stake in the community it ensured that power rested only in the hands of the elite and kept undesirables out of power. Undesirables like the working poor, women, blacks, and the uneducated. It ensured the survival of slavery well into the 19th century and allowed the abuse of natives and women. \n\n&gt;Citizens and civilians are held to the same law as each other, and no distinction is ever given to one over the other in any law or court. They are all members of the same society, and are treated thus.\n\nBut how do you ensure that lack of of distinction remains when the law is already inherently unequal? What recourse does a disenfranchised civilian have, beyond a court system that is populated solely by the empowered, if the citizens decide to treat civilians differently?\n\n&gt; Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of conscience are wildly protected in this system, but if you want to influence how things are done, you need to demonstrate you understand the responsibility which espouses that power.\n\nSpeech, the press, and conscience all have power and influence. All these rights come with responsibilities. If the right to vote can be stripped away because of this, what's then to prevent those other rights, or any rights at all, to be stripped away?\n\n&gt;Why would this system not work?\n\nHistory is rife with examples where systems allow legal inequality, which are then abused by the elites against the non-elites. History is also rife with examples of the non-elites turning, often violently, against the elite.\n\n&gt; Why does being born into a system give you the right to change it implicitly? \n\nBecause anything less is slavery, of one sort or another. A person born into a society, unless he is an invalid or criminal, will inherently provide a service to the community, despite your arguments otherwise. Why then shouldn't they have an equal say in how that society is run?\n\n&gt;What would be a better way of proving one\u2019s commitment to the collective community than a term of federal service?\n\nThe onus of that question is on you. Federal service is fine, even good. But why is it the best service that someone can provide? And therefore, why is it the only means to enfranchisement. \n\n**TL;DR - We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.**", "id": "t1_c7rmy23", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Paladinltd", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c7ro23w", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "laxhawk", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c7ryhg1", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Not_a_Zaku", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_160ijy", "id": "t1_c7s0pwo", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "laxhawk", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;One could say the minority in a democracy is disenfranchised with the same degree of certainty as a civilian in Heinlein's system. \n\nOne can't without being intellectually dishonest.

They are equal before the law.\n\nThe law, by having a franchised and disfranchised class, already makes a distinction. If the state passes laws that affects the both classes, but only the citizens have the ability to affect those laws, then the only protection that civilians have from abuse by the state is the whim of the enfranchised. History demonstrates that rule by minority always leads to abuse.\n\n* Why is sovereign franchise a right?\n\nBecause consent is a right. \n\nWhy should the state be allowed to tax me and spend the money as it see fit, or pass laws that limit my conduct but the only means to alter the state is through indentured servitude to it? Not to slide down the slippery slope, but this question can be taken: can the state demand a kidney from  me without my consent? Or my life? Or my first born child? My question is: why are people inherently undeserving of sovereign franchise such that they have to jump through hoops to get it?\n\n*  Anyone who desires franchise can get it.\n\nHere's my problem with that: by requiring service to the state as a path to enfranchisement you're essentially placing your philosophical view of the state above all others. What if I'm a libertarian or anarchist, and I view the state and rendering service to it repugnant? Or what if such service is against my religious views? What if I'm a believer in states rights over that of the federal government? What if I'm a pacifist, and believe the state is violent war machine that should be stopped, peacefully? What if I have a once in lifetime job offer right out of school that I need to take immediately or it'll slip away? What if I just don't want to? The real question is why is your view of government inherently superior to all the foregoing?\n\n* Service to the collective is not service to the State. Everyone contributes to the collective, but as far as I can see, only some people who desire franchise would contribute to the state.\n\nI agree with your point that service to the collective is not service to the State, but in a free and fair society the State serves at the behest of the collective's will. How can the State serve the collective will if the collective's ability to affect the State is limited? If State will pass laws that will affect everyone, regardless of services rendered to the state, everyone so affected should have a say in those laws.\n\n* Below you quote that \"all men are created equal\". In this case, how does modern day America ensure the same?\n\nAll power flows from the ballot box. All laws are made by legislatures elected by the peoples wills. Those laws are enforced by the executive branch elected in much the same way. Judges, who arbitrate the laws, are appointed by the elected executive and approved by the elected legislature. In order to be convicted in a court of law, both criminal and civil, the consent of a jury of our peers is required. This is why the right to suffrage is so vital; it's the best guarantee of a free society.\n\n* You also mention how a person's taxes could be used to provide evidence of a person's stake in the state. These taxes are indistinguishable between citizens and civilians, and provide for the safety and well-being of the collective through the state.

The only protection that civilians have from abuse by the state is the whim of the enfranchised.\n\nMy only response to this is please demonstrate a situation where a law could be written which negatively impacts a civilian disproportionately to a citizen. I urge you to remember that this system views them as entirely equal before the law, and forbids distinguishing between them in any form of legislation (except I suppose the franchise order being discussed).

Why someone who is born into a society they disagree with have more rights than someone who was not born into it, but wishes to join? Everyone in this proposed society has a choice to tolerate the society they were born into, or contribute to it, and change it. Recall there is no limitation on freedom of speech, and I could see civilians voicing their opinion very loudly, but if they truly cared about voicing their opinion, why would they not put something into the system and actually add their voice to the vote? \n\n* What if I conscientiously object to the actions of the state? Why should I have to contribute to it, in effect support it, in order to change it?\n\nThis comes down to my previous statement. Why should being born into a society grant you rights to remain over someone who was not, and wants to join? If the objector cannot tolerate the state enough to put in his stake by service, but he can tolerate it enough to hang around and enjoy the benefits of the society he was born into, then he is free to. If he cannot tolerate it enough to serve and earn his franchise, and he cannot tolerate it enough to abide its laws, why should he remain a part of the society? This is the central tenet of this government.\n\n* If State will pass laws that will affect everyone, regardless of services rendered to the state, everyone so affected should have a say in those laws.\n\nI would qualify that statement with \"everyone so affected should have **the ability to** have a say in those laws.\" Why should subjecting yourself to a the laws of a society immediately qualify you to modify those laws? Why should you not first have to demonstrate that you have something vested in the society before you come in and change all of the rules? Notice that to me, \"coming in\" to a society includes being born into it. \n\n* All power flows from the ballot box. All of our elected officials are appointed by ballot. This is why the right to suffrage is so vital; it's the best guarantee of a free society.\n\nI could not agree more, except that the right to suffrage is not a right, but a privilege to earned. This argument went very circular.\n\n* The answer to this is simple, as it's codified in our founding mythology - no taxation without representation. **Our forefathers shed blood for that notion**, why do we deserve any less?\n\nOur forefathers shed blood for that notion. They wanted to be represented and put their lives on the line to earn that representation. Why do we do any less? \n\n* \"That to secure these rights (Life, Liberty, and Pursuit of Happiness), Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\"\n\nBy subjecting themselves to being governed, the governed give their consent. Again, if the disenfranchised do not care enough to contribute and gain their franchise, regardless of their own views, but can tolerate being a part of the society, they are very free to do so. But if they do not care enough to contribute and gain their franchise, and cannot tolerate the laws of the society they are knowingly living within, why should they be themselves tolerated?", "edited": 1357515704, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7s7s52", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357509685", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c7ro23w", "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1430876960, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_160ijy", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7s6uao", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357506893", "ups": 4, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c7rmy23", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1430867121, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;I disagree. The movie provides excellent demonstration of the flaws inherent to the system outlined in the book. If ultimate power is derived from the State, and the State limits enfranchisement to the minority of elite few who provide service to itself, what would prevent the State from transforming from a meritocracy to an oligarchy, or an aristocracy?\n\nThe way I saw it, ultimate power was not derived from the State, but in ones ability to alter the State itself. As for what prevents the State from transforming into an oligarchy, meritocracy, or aristocracy, the very simply fact that all men (and women) are held equal under the law. As I said before, no law could be made which distinguished the rights of a citizen over that of a disenfranchised civilian. They are equal before the law. There is no \"elite few\", the power of franchise is available to all those willing to work for it.\n\n&gt;Incorrect. Barriers to enfranchisement are inherently undemocratic and illiberal. No one should have to 'earn' the right to vote, any more then anyone should have to earn any other right. A system where inequality is inherent can hardly be called open or free.\n\nIn this you have defined a right. I am questioning if that right is indeed a right. By you saying that no one should have to earn the right I am questioning based on the fact that it is a right, it is a bit of a circular argument. Why is sovereign franchise a right? This is essentially the issue I have been trying to get at.\n\n&gt;That's understandable. We want those with power to have the responsibility to use wisely. But limiting power to a select few is not the means to achieve this. The British monarchy had a responsibility to their American colonies, and unlimited power over the disenfranchised citizens of those colonies. Without recourse to protect against those abuses, the Americans did the only thing the felt they could do: rebel, violently.\n\nBut this would not limit power to a select few. Anyone who wishes it can have it. It is there for collecting if anyone has the gumption to reach out and take it. The State in this government would not have \"unlimited power over the disenfranchised [civilians]\", as it is entirely unable to design a law which distinguished a civilian from a citizen. This is the recourse to protect against those abuses. \n\nI will save the rebellion issue for another time, Heinlein himself addresses it directly in the novel. \n\n&gt;The State is not the collective, and service to the State is not the only means of have a stake in the collective. A citizen, whose enfranchisement is a birthright, lives in a place, paying property taxes which goes towards the education of children. They work and in working, beyond providing goods and services to the pubic, pay payroll and income taxes which go towards the payment of services both federal and state. In registering to vote, they are required to serve jury duty when requested and, if they are male at least, to sign up for conscription in case of a war. Why is this insufficient? How does a doctor, serving outside the state, not provide a service to the collective? Or for that matter a dockworker, a trash collector, or fast food cashier?\n\nWhat is the state but a moral reflection of the collective it represents? And I agree entirely with everything you have said here, especially, \"service to the State is not the only means of have a stake in the collective.\" Civilians have a stake in the collective. The dockworker, the trash collector, the fast food cashier all have stakes in the collective, as it is where they seek their fortune. Doctors provide services to the collective. All of these people have the opportunity to participate in the State, but to do so, they first must claim their stake. They must first put forth some service to the state depending on their skill set, and in doing so, earn their franchise and ability to participate. Everyone born into the collective ekes out their own stake, but only those who would wish it reach out and put their stake in the government. \n\nYou also mention how a person's taxes could be used to provide evidence of a person's stake in the state. These taxes are indistinguishable between citizens and civilians, and provide for the safety and well-being of the collective through the state. I guess I just do not see how this contributes to a person's franchise. Taxes are a fee for living in the sanctity of a society, and are paid by everyone. Just as an example, immigrants and minors in today's America pay taxes, but do not have franchise. \n\n&gt;And by allowing an arbitrary definition of who has a stake in the community it ensured that power rested only in the hands of the elite and kept undesirables out of power. Undesirables like the working poor, women, blacks, and the uneducated. It ensured the survival of slavery well into the 19th century and allowed the abuse of natives and women.\n\nI was referring to the intent behind the law, which was to only allow those who paid taxes on the land the government was governing to exercise franchise. Due to other factors this did indeed lead to the consequences which you have laid out, perhaps it was not the best example.\n\n&gt;But how do you ensure that lack of of distinction remains when the law is already inherently unequal? What recourse does a disenfranchised civilian have, beyond a court system that is populated solely by the empowered, if the citizens decide to treat civilians differently?\n\nBelow you quote that \"**all men are created equal**\". In this case, how does modern day America ensure the same?\n\n&gt;Speech, the press, and conscience all have power and influence. All these rights come with responsibilities. If the right to vote can be stripped away because of this, what's then to prevent those other rights, or any rights at all, to be stripped away?\n\nAgain you are claiming that a right (natural born sovereign franchise)that I am arguing should not be a right is a right on the simple virtue that it is a right. I cannot argue against that other than to say, why? As for you other point, civilians and citizens are indistinct under law. How is a right to be stripped away from one population without doing the same to the other?\n\n&gt;History is rife with examples where systems allow legal inequality, which are then abused by the elites against the non-elites. History is also rife with examples of the non-elites turning, often violently, against the elite.\n\nThere is no inequality in this system. Anyone who desires franchise can get it. There is an elite/non-elite distinction in this system, just as there is in modern day America. This distinction does not follow lines of if someone is a civilian or a citizen. It is simply a measure of their savvy in working with the collective. \n\n&gt;Because anything less is slavery, of one sort or another. A person born into a society, unless he is an invalid or criminal, will inherently provide a service to the community, despite your arguments otherwise. Why then shouldn't they have an equal say in how that society is run?\n\nHow do you define invalid, because I could define it as someone who does not have public conscience. How do you define criminal, because I could define it as someone who wishes something from the state without first giving into it more than just tax dollars. You are again going back to the circular argument of franchise is a right because it is a right, but I will leave that alone this time. \n\n&gt;The onus of that question is on you. Federal service is fine, even good. But why is it the best service that someone can provide? And therefore, why is it the only means to enfranchisement.\n\nI have had a slight shift in my rhetoric since beginning this response, indicated above, but I do not think it changes how you would have answered. Service to the collective is not service to the State. Everyone contributes to the collective, but as far as I can see, only some people who desire franchise would contribute to the state. So is there any other way to define service to the state other than a term of servitude? \n\n&gt;TL;DR - We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\n\nI'll let Heinlein himself respond to those claims:\n\n\"Ah, yes, the 'unalienable rights.' Each year someone quotes that magnificent poetry. Life? What 'right' to life has a man who is drowning in the Pacific? The ocean will not hearken to his cries. What `right' to life has a man who must die if he is to save his children? If he chooses to save his own life, does he do so as a matter of 'right'? If two men are starving and cannibalism is the only alternative to death, which man's right is 'unalienable'? And is it 'right'? As to liberty, the heroes who signed that great document pledged themselves to buy liberty with their lives. Liberty is never unalienable; it must be redeemed regularly with the blood of patriots or it always vanishes. Of all the so-called 'natural human rights' that have ever been invented, liberty is least likely to be cheap and is never free of cost.\n\n\"The third 'right'? -- the 'pursuit of happiness'? It is indeed unalienable but it is not a right; it is simply a universal condition which tyrants cannot take away nor patriots restore. Cast me into a dungeon, burn me at the stake, crown me king of kings, I can 'pursue happiness' as long as my brain lives -- but neither gods nor saints, wise men nor subtle drugs, can insure that I will catch it.\"\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_160ijy", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7ro23w", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357424352", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_160ijy", "selftext": "&gt;what would prevent the State from transforming from a meritocracy to an oligarchy, or an aristocracy? \n\nwhat prevents universal franchise democracies from being an oligarchy controlled by media and financial interests?", "id": "t1_c7s7q3i", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "C-LAR", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c7rmy23", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430877379, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7s7q3i", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357509514", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t3_160ijy", "score": 16, "retrieved_on": 1430866523, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_160ijy", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7rmy23", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357420379", "ups": 16, "distinguished": null}
