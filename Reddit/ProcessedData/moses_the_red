If you're in what is in effect a local monopoly, you'd lose that. You might even start struggling to meet that 2 million a year. Your employees might start leaving you too, because rather than shut his business down and fire his employees when he hits the 2 million dollar mark like some complete asshole, your former employee's company might raise wages and benefits for its employees, which might draw away most of your top talent (even after picking up all the people you laid off). His company would then be full of happier people making enough to support themselves, and they'd know that they have a boss willing to compensate them, so they'd work in a better work environment, and at the end of the day, offer higher client satisfaction.\n\nNow you'd have to personally work much harder, and offer better incentives for your employees to attempt to match what your former employee's company is offering if you want to keep your precious 2 million dollar a year cash cow business from collapsing.\n\n2 million dollars is about equal to 40 man years of work for the average person. Its what most people might make in their entire lifetime. I personally would not shed any tears over your plight should such a thing occur as you'd still be extraordinarily rich. That said, I'm not for a maximum wage. High tax rates yes, but not a maximum wage. 75% taxes should get most of the benefit while keeping incentives high for the wealthy. If nothing else going for 75 over 100 should keep us all from drowning in a sea of rich tears.\n\nThis exchange between us, is a great example of why one of the pillars of right wing thinking is so flawed. The right believes that successful people are successful because of their individual actions. This is partly true, but they're also successful because of the presence of opportunities in their environment. The opportunity, the demand is what really governs business. The rich are not job creators, demand is what creates jobs. If you gave up your business, someone else would step in because there is demand. You started it, so you deserve credit, but if you didn't exist, people would still be able to buy CPA services in your area.\n\nIf Walmart up and collapsed tomorrow, Target, Kmart or some other perhaps new corporation would immediately take its place. The Waltons did not gift the world with megastores, they did some work, and deserve some compensation, but if they were never born there would still be megastores. \n\nSo why the hell do they pocket more than 40% of Americans?", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "moses_the_red", "id": "t1_c8mkdmx", "parent_id": "t1_c8lyidu", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431425927, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1361973412, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_19935q", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8mkdmx", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361972026", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}

Social contracts, being social, can only exist between persons, and are only binding to the extent that, in essence, \"you have previously observed me to act in this manner, and you can be assured that this is the manner in which I will continue to act\".\n\n&gt;Notice that these are individual, two party contracts. \"This is how I will treat you, and this is how you will treat me\". These \"contracts\" are immediately, regularly, and constantly modified by our observation of other's behavior. If someone who has previously given you no threat of violence punches you in the face, their SC with you has been modified to warn you that further punchings may be had, and now your SC with them must be modified to respect this risk.\n\n&gt;That is at its fundamental level, what a social contract is - your informed expectation of how others will treat you, and how you will respond to their treatment. Note the lack of a state at any point in this construct. A state is a mutually shared illusion between many parties, not just two parties, and thus cannot be justified by SCs.\n\n&gt;Statists like to justify the state through social contracts, by claiming that SCs are the basis of the state, and the state is the formalization of the most generally shared characteristics of the SCs, such as, most people mutually agree that they will not commit violence on others, and will respond to violence committed against themselves.\n\n&gt;A statist points to this mutuality among diverse SCs and says \"here, the people have agreed to the police\". But this ignores that the SCs are mutable and constantly mutating. So an establishment or fixture cannot be supported by SCs because SCs change constantly, and the purpose of an establishment (such as a police agency) is to not change.\n\n&gt;So, the state is not based upon SCs, and SCs do not justify the state. At best, SCs inform what kinds of behavioral expectations are widely shared, which in some ways is reflected in the state's actions, but by no means does the fact that I treat you this way and you treat me that way justify that we impose our manners of mutual treatment on an uninvolved third party. That is to say, SCs do not justify the state.\n\nSocial contracts are not the same thing as more traditional contracts like hiring a plumber to fix your pipes. They are a wholly different beast.\n\n&gt;Get over it.\n\nThis is a sign of intellectual laziness if I've ever seen it.\n\n&gt;If you want to live the libertarian dream where everything you earn is yours by right, move\n\n\"This is 'Murica.

That would be the moral thing to do right, as we avoid raising anyone's taxes. \n\nHere's why your argument makes no sense: \n\n* We, in the United States, are part of a social contract. This contract impinges on our freedoms, for instance, we're not allowed to murder anyone. The terms of this contract are decided by the people signed onto the contract, ie United States citizens. \n\nNow you might argue that its not a contract since you didn't sign anything, but I imagine that you're a big fan of the \"do not murder\" clause that you've benefited from since Birth when, by being born on US soil, you were entered into the contract (or you can say that your parents chose for you by bearing you here). \n\nSo since this whole society is set up by contract and we're all a part of it, and since the contract explicitly states that the government gets the power to change taxation policies, it is not stealing when the government raises taxes and extracts more money from the population. \n\nSo the entire \"Its stealing\" argument is BS, its only valuable as a talking point for people that don't actually understand how government and society works. \n\n* Cambodia is not a part of the US, and therefore is not subject to the American Social Contract. That said I am in favor of taxing the rich more to send aid to the people of Cambodia. \n\nSo, in conclusion, taxation is not stealing, and Cambodia is not a US territory. \n\nPS: I'm personally at about the 80th percentile, and I live in a blue state.

Progressive taxation is completely justified for the wealthy because they aren't competing on a level playing field. A person's competitiveness in the marketplace is largely determined by the amount of resources that person has at their disposal. If the person has hundreds or thousands or millions of times more resources at their disposal than the rest of us, then they're no longer really earning their money. Their money is earning their money. \n\nThe simple proof of this is that you can be a complete idiot and make billions just by hiring people that aren't complete idiots to manage your money for you. Now, people can claim that they're earning it by risking their money, but frankly if they spent their money that would help the economy too. Beyond that if I could risk 10% of my total wealth to make say, 20 mil, I'd do it in a heartbeat. I don't see why when they take the same risk, on money that is worth far less to them than my 10% is to me, they should be rewarded with 400 work year's worth of reward. \n\nThat is not \"earning\" it. You're acquiring it, sure, but you sure as hell didn't earn that money. The money was likely earned by all the people that actually put in the work generate those profits. \n\nSo yeah, I think its time for a change.

I mean, I guess if we could convince Europe to engage in another total war to eliminate its industrial capacity, somehow make China go back to its shattered state after Mao's takeover to essentially leave us as the only intact industrialized society...\n\nThat'd be a start.  \n\nAlso, we had usually one worker in the family, less technology and smaller homes.

Social contracts, being social, can only exist between persons, and are only binding to the extent that, in essence, \"you have previously observed me to act in this manner, and you can be assured that this is the manner in which I will continue to act\".\n\n&gt;Notice that these are individual, two party contracts. \"This is how I will treat you, and this is how you will treat me\". These \"contracts\" are immediately, regularly, and constantly modified by our observation of other's behavior. If someone who has previously given you no threat of violence punches you in the face, their SC with you has been modified to warn you that further punchings may be had, and now your SC with them must be modified to respect this risk.\n\n&gt;That is at its fundamental level, what a social contract is - your informed expectation of how others will treat you, and how you will respond to their treatment. Note the lack of a state at any point in this construct. A state is a mutually shared illusion between many parties, not just two parties, and thus cannot be justified by SCs.\n\n&gt;Statists like to justify the state through social contracts, by claiming that SCs are the basis of the state, and the state is the formalization of the most generally shared characteristics of the SCs, such as, most people mutually agree that they will not commit violence on others, and will respond to violence committed against themselves.\n\n&gt;A statist points to this mutuality among diverse SCs and says \"here, the people have agreed to the police\". But this ignores that the SCs are mutable and constantly mutating. So an establishment or fixture cannot be supported by SCs because SCs change constantly, and the purpose of an establishment (such as a police agency) is to not change.\n\n&gt;So, the state is not based upon SCs, and SCs do not justify the state. At best, SCs inform what kinds of behavioral expectations are widely shared, which in some ways is reflected in the state's actions, but by no means does the fact that I treat you this way and you treat me that way justify that we impose our manners of mutual treatment on an uninvolved third party. That is to say, SCs do not justify the state.\n\nSocial contracts are not the same thing as more traditional contracts like hiring a plumber to fix your pipes. They are a wholly different beast.\n\n&gt;Get over it.\n\nThis is a sign of intellectual laziness if I've ever seen it.\n\n&gt;If you want to live the libertarian dream where everything you earn is yours by right, move\n\n\"This is 'Murica.

For instance if you are living on an island (like in the TV show Lost) and you see everybody catching fish with a spear, and you realize that if you take a bunch of strings left from the plane crash and weave into a net then you will be able to catch a lot more fish, and this results in you being able to catch 500% more fish than what you were able to do with a spear then those extra fish or the 'profit' is what was left over from your efficient reallocation of strings into something more productive.\n\nLosses are what the destruction of utility caused by that rearrangement initiative.\n\nProfit and losses exist in reality, they are included in almost every action you perform. IF you eat a burger and enjoyed it then you had profit there(psychological or psychic profit in this case), if you didn't like that burger then it was a psychic loss for you.\n\nIf you buy a microwave for your restaurant business and because of it you were able to produce more food items in less time then the extra money you made was the profit out of rearrangement of the goods. You got that profit because you reduce the time it takes to serve the customer and the food items you produce now cost less.\n\nIF you buy a microwave for your own house and again are able to eat more warm food then you got profit out of it. If you buy it and you don't use it at all then you got a loss in terms of the money you spent on a useless product which you could have spent on something else more profitable.\n\nNow think about healthcare. If an entrepreneur builds a hospital, but he doesn't make profit then he wasted the resources into building something which wan't the most optimum usage of resources. Similarly if he does make a profit then that means he was able to provide this massive utility to the people it serves that it made profit.\n\nYou may ask \"but even if a hospital is making loss, but it is serving only poor patients, wouldn't it be providing a psychic profit to the society\", but the problem is psychic profits only make sense in individual whose psychological desire they aimed to satiate. In this case if the entrepreneur wanted to make psychological profit then he would run a non-profit charity hospital. But don't forget, by making profit, entrepreneur can invest more into the hospital and expand its coverage and activities to serve more people.\n\nIf private hospitals didn't make profit then you can expect to get a very limited and restricted healthcare coverage.  We aim to expand healthcare coverage, and get better at it. If in the name of providing coverage to more people, it restricts increase of healthcare quality and coverage in future timeframes, then your solution also suffers from the same problem you're claiming to solve.\n\nBut what if the govt operated hospitals, sure govt has a huge budget, can't they run healthcare industries the same way. I mean this argument does have a merit from a cursory glance. To think about it, isn't that what govt is doing in defense industry? Defense industry serves only one client, that is the govt, and defense industries are very profitable, and look at the sheer amount of advance weaponry American defense companies product.\n\nThe problem is that there's no profit and loss calculation possible for a nationalized industry, so you can be very sure that it is a net destruction of resources. American defense industry isn't a beautiful example of how a monopolized industry could sustain itself, but its a good example how terribly unaware we would be about the sheer amount of wealth, prosperity and happiness we would be destroying if we had nationalized an industry. \n\nIt could be totally possible that America(and the world) was a much more prosperous, and richer place had US govt didn't spend such a tremendous amount of money on so little benefit. We might have had manned private mars exploration by now, a lot less poverty, our Internet could have been so good that we would be hiring world's most smart teachers to teach our kids remotely through robots.\n\nBut because that didn't happen, its easier to look at the performance of US defense and say \"look they are doing so good\". \n\nEverything should be done for profit, if it needs to be done good and if any progress is deemed to be made. Defense industry just aims to kill and destroy property, so god only knows what an \"efficient\" operation of national defense would mean(more efficient killing and destruction or less killing and destruction), but in case of healthcare and education we can clearly see that we WANT our people to not die, live as long as possible, not suffer from cancer, be the smartest and brilliant as much as possible in the world, so we definitely can't afford to have a nationalized healthcare and educational system.\n\nLemme reiterate, Profit isn't a 'concern', it is an indispensable tool for being anything remotely sustainable. Without it we're all doomed.\n\n&gt; What if a company decided to abandon a town's infrastructure because it became unprofitable because another company failed in a town hurting the revenue base? Why would anyone step in?\n\nYour question(because of a fundamental misunderstanding of 'profits') is tantamount of asking \"what if a owner abandons a building because he has no use to it? Who will step in fix the building and take care of it\".\n\nEconomics tells us that as long as there are people living in the town, and using those infrastructure services for something productive, then infrastructure would be profitable. Why? Because its like asking that a guy makes $60,000 a year, but his car he uses to go to work is broken, who will step in and fix his car if he can't afford it?\n\n&gt; What is so wrong when enough people want socialist attitude when it comes to education, health care, infrastructure and defense/judicial system ?\n\nThe problem with taking a socialist attitude towards education/healthcare/infrastructure etc is simple, if socialist attitude towards few industries could be good, then why not everything be socialist(i.e. nationalized)?? **Why is capitalist attitude towards producing tv, movies, books, music, phones, homes etc is good but socialist attitude towards these things isn't?** ", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8kyld3", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361741652", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c8kl2ix", "parent_id": "t1_c8kaxb7", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431387727, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Most people agree I'm sure in a perfect world there would be no taxes but our world is far from it and that is why the Government needs to exist as a vehicle for democratic action. Privatizing everything is a horrible idea because it puts profit first. With less regulation more manipulation could occur and companies have more rights to their own privacy than say the government so transparency is lost because they have no authority to abide to.\n\nWhen it comes to health care, defense, education, infrastructure and judicial/police, money profit shouldn't and can't be the main concern. Also if your world with no taxes happened what is going to stop a billionaire who has money to waste from damaging our society? \n\nAlso what happens to those who loose their job especially when it isn't their fault. Who will help them? What if a company decided to abandon a town's infrastructure because it became unprofitable because another company failed in a town hurting the revenue base? Why would anyone step in? \n\nA strong government that is transparent and democratic seems to me as better choice. What would a country be like with everything dependent on money profit? My guess would be a ugly, cut throat one. What if a company ruins the environment around a certain area because they calculated the cost of paying lawsuits over potential money and net profit could happen? Humans are too imperfect to live in exclusive for money profit world.\n\nWhat is so wrong when enough people want socialist attitude when it comes to education, health care, infrastructure and defense/judicial system ? At least with the government you can legally enforce transparency and citizens legally have the power over the government through elections. Private companies can essentially do what ever they want as long as they make money and can manipulate because they don't have to be reconfirmed in their position of power", "edited": 1361677122, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8kl2ix", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361674366", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "splintercell", "id": "t1_c8kaxb7", "parent_id": "t1_c8iz4m4", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431382847, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sorry for responding you so late, but a society can work without taxes the same way it does more than 90% of the things. You don't get your food funded through taxes, you don't live in a tax funded house. You consume what you pay for. The same way society can work with the duties which most people consider as indispensable or that only a government could be able to do(such as roads, courts, police and national defense).\n\nSee the problem is, its difficult to envision how these services would work without a govt because they have been always provided to us by the govt. A free market court system would be a lot more efficient in delivering justice because the more people a free market dispute resolution company serves(of course with customer satisfaction) the more money it makes. If there is a bureaucratic hurdle or slow moving part in your dispute resolution organization(or in short DRO) then you need to fix it in order to make more profit. Court managers will send their employees on retreats, buy them faster computers, cell phones (all part of ongoing capital costs). New companies will prop up trying to be more efficient in resolving disputes.\n\nSame thing goes with police system. The reason why you're secure right now is not because of the police, because most of the security provided to you today is done through private means. You have a lock on your door, a doorman in your building or ID access system, that's not govt at all. When you go to a movie theatre, a (private) school, a mall or any business establishment, there are usually employees who have their best interest to ensure you are safe, or private guards specifically hired to ensure that people are safe. In case of a conflict between two individuals, a third party arbitration system could be utilized.\n\nYou might wonder how the law would work if everything is private? Sure nobody is going to enforce drug laws, or prevent gay sex or stupid shit like that, but the 'real problems' will evolve into common law. This is how the whole common law system in England evolved. There were private judges, and whenever they got a case in front of them they decided upon it based on what was the pre-established judgements given. If this is the first time a farmer had his cows killed by his neighbor for venturing on his property, they consulted each other, and established precedents(different from the legal precedent system we have now). These things over time became so consistent that we knew them as common law before it was adopted as statutes by people.\n\nYou might wonder about authority issues, why would two individual agree to accept a third party arbitration? To start with, we already have a third party arbitration system for a lot of things in America. Check out AAA(American Arbitrators Association). Secondly, most of our judicial system relies on 90% of the cases never reaching in front of the judge and the jury, they are settled outside the courts through lawyers, who's the authority here? There is no need of a superior authority, only a desire to settle a dispute, then people can agree on a common third party arbitrator. If you are interested in knowing what happens when two parties cannot agree upon a common arbitrator then I will explain those scenarios for you, but its a very fascinating field.\n\nSame goes for National defense. If we don't have taxation or federal/state government, what stops say another country from invading and taking over and establishing the govt. The answer is, nothing stops anyone from invading a free hold territory, but don't forget, conventional armies are only good at fighting other conventional armies. American army kicked ass in WW1 and WW2, but failed miserably in Vietnam. Then again when it had to fight Republican Guards in first gulf war, it did fine, but when it came down to Iraq and Afghanistan war, its being bled without a victory in sight. USSR couldn't successfully take over Afghanistan either. \n\nThe point being that to understand the incentives behind invading a free area without a govt vs another nation for anyone is the same thing as if a farmer who wants to increase the number of his cattles, takes over his neighbor's farm by killing him, vs he tries to take over a jungle full of wild animals.\n\nTax funded govts want to invade other tax funded nations to increase the pool of their tax payers. Invading a non-tax paying geographical area makes little sense because it requires double the amount of task to turn them into tax payers.\n\nAlso don't forget trading with an anarcho-capitalist geographical region would make a lot more sense than invading them. If Saudi Arabia was a govt less anrcho-capitalist ground, America will never have to maintain occupation anywhere because there would be no need to worry about its govt restricting American oil supply(like what happened in 70s during OPEC oil crises). Buying oil from an ancap oil company in Middle East would be no different than buying oil from an American company(in fact it would be cheaper because no govt is taxing that company).\n\nAnyways, I am here to answer any questions you might have about a society without government or taxation.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18w3zb", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8kaxb7", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361634624", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c8iz4m4", "parent_id": "t1_c8iwuwy", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1435581612, "controversiality": 0, "body": "How can society work without taxes?", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18w3zb", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8iz4m4", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361430193", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "parent_id": "t1_c8iq8sf", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431358589, "controversiality": 0, "body": "No", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18w3zb", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8iwuwy", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361421518", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c8ippa4", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431355461, "controversiality": 0, "body": "So you think there should be not taxes?", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18w3zb", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8iq8sf", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361401451", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c8ip745", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431355126, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; Why do taxes exist in the first place, read the constitution...

My take away on the subjet is that all the places in the world where most people would like to be born and live have the narrowest gab between rich an poor.   That is places like Norway, Germany, Sweeden have narrow gaps, while places with large gaps all belong to developing countries , Sudan, Nigeria, Somalia.  With one exception, the USA Gini is more suitable to developing countries than industrialize countries.\n\nTo clarify my though experiment about where would somebody prefer to be born if given a choice.  Think of it as you're giving one choice; what country do you want be born? but have not control about the family or your soci-economical status in such country. would you prefer Sweden, where you are guarantee excellent education and health service to you and your parents just for being born there or Somalia, where you may be born in a upper class and have everything your heart desires or  brutal poverty, most people would choose the former.\nExcept that Americans had a tendency to think the may give it a go to the later an play the odds, the reason for that is because Americans are being told that the USA have great social mobility, you can be born dirt poor and die richer that Rockeffeler (Notice I didn't use B. Gates as example), well this is a lie, **social mobility in the USA is very low**, you are very likely to die in the class you are born more so that if you're born in Europe.\n\n&gt;Several studies have been made comparing social mobility between developed countries. One such study (\u201cDo Poor Children Become Poor Adults?\")[5][19][20] found that of nine developed countries, the United States and United Kingdom had the lowest intergenerational vertical social mobility\n\n[Social mobility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_mobility)\n\nTL;DR auditortux is using a straw-men; all the available data suggest a small income gap is best for society", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_18w3zb", "selftext": "&gt;Except that Americans had a tendency to think the may give it a go to the later an play the odds, the reason for that is because Americans are being told that the USA have great social mobility, you can be born dirt poor and die richer that Rockeffeler (Notice I didn't use B.

You don't get that sort of mobility without extreme luck, whether in genetics or opportunity.\n\nOh, and why not look at \"socio-economic mobility in the US\" rather than just the generic.  You'll find this:\n\n&gt; A 2007 study \"Economic Mobility Project: Across Generations,\" using Panel Study of Income Dynamics, found 67% of Americans who were children in 1968 had higher levels of real family income in 1995\u20132002 than their parents had in 1967\u20131971[23] (although most of this growth in total family income can be attributed to the increasing number of women who work since male earnings have stayed relatively stable throughout this time[23]) As to whether this figure is higher or lower than other countries is difficult to say as this type of measure has not been done for other countries.[23]\n\nSocial mobility depends on a lot, especially when comparing to other nations.  We're radically diverse compared to Nordic countries.  And I argue that government programs make it harder to move up thanks to various benefit program \"cliffs\" that should instead phase out.\n\nWhatever.  In the end, I'm the one arguing that people can do it, and you're arguing people can't.  And somehow that message wins.

Progressive taxation is completely justified for the wealthy because they aren't competing on a level playing field. A person's competitiveness in the marketplace is largely determined by the amount of resources that person has at their disposal. If the person has hundreds or thousands or millions of times more resources at their disposal than the rest of us, then they're no longer really earning their money. Their money is earning their money. \n\nThe simple proof of this is that you can be a complete idiot and make billions just by hiring people that aren't complete idiots to manage your money for you. Now, people can claim that they're earning it by risking their money, but frankly if they spent their money that would help the economy too. Beyond that if I could risk 10% of my total wealth to make say, 20 mil, I'd do it in a heartbeat. I don't see why when they take the same risk, on money that is worth far less to them than my 10% is to me, they should be rewarded with 400 work year's worth of reward. \n\nThat is not \"earning\" it. You're acquiring it, sure, but you sure as hell didn't earn that money. The money was likely earned by all the people that actually put in the work generate those profits. \n\nSo yeah, I think its time for a change.

I'm saying they (along with stronger unions) led to prosperity by making hording wealth less palatable. \n\nMembers of the board looking to reward the company for a job well done 35 years ago were more likely to increase worker wages (as evidenced by the relationship between productivity and wages from the 40s through about 1975).

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Polarization is not the problem.\n\nLook, whenever someone new to politics starts poking around and investigating this stuff, they come up with the following idea.\n\n\"Well, we have two parties, and its not likely that either one is right on everything, its probably about evenly split, with each party being right on about half of the issues. That means that I should be in the center, where the truth lies between the two parties, and those people that are far to either the right or the left must be crazy/insane/deranged/wrong etc.\"\n\nOn the surface this seems to make sense. If you had a normal group of people arguing in a normal situation, this heuristic would probably lead you to the right answers. However, if you delve just a little bit deeper, you find the following truth. Politics is about the battle between those that are powerful and those that are not. It always has been, this basic rule has never changed. \n\nThe right fights for the powerful. They don't all know it, and they don't all care that they do, but they absolutely do fight for the elites, the haves, the powerful. \n\nThis thread might give you a little more information on this:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/18oyut/right_wingers_do_you_recognize_that_your/\n\nThe left is generally those that are fighting for the non-powerful, or those that are not prepared to fight as hard for the elites as those said to be on the right.\n\nPretty much all political issues in the US can be broken down into two categories. They're either issues that directly benefit the wealthy (lower the tax burden on the wealthy, move to a flat tax, cut government spending so there's room for more tax cuts in the budget etc) or their wedge issues that give the elites enough political capital to continue fighting for more power (gun rights, abortion, prayer in schools etc). \n\nSo what you have is an attractor. You have this immense pull in the political world towards the right by propaganda that the right puts out (AM talk radio, Fox News... and more subtle organizations like the Heritage Foundation and Cato) and its shifted what should be normal politically far out of whack. \n\nSome like to pretend that things are equal, and that there are people fighting for the left. Remember though that the left is largely made up of the powerless. The only real power these people have is their vote.\n\nYou live in a world today where the owners of Walmat, 4 people, control more wealth than 40% of Americans. You live in a world where there are Billionaires, people that are as much richer than the average rich man (millionaires) as the millionaires are richer than you. People that control the amount of resources that a small city of dozens of thousands might have at its disposal. Financial gods that weild the power of small countries... and sometimes much more.\n\nPolarization is not the problem. The problem is that there are people that seek immense power at the expense of the rest of us and they are using the very latest and most sophpisticated propaganda techniqes to bend the people to their will. The average American's income has fallen in the last 30 years even as our output and GDP have skyrocketed. \n\nSo yeah, on the surface it might seem like the middle is the place to be, its not.

I say this as the burden on \"big money\" has been going up, but everyone seems to think they are better off.  Or is it just a matter of class envy?\n\n&gt;You often want to cut government, some of you will explicitly say that you want to cut benefits for the poor, others just vaguely stand by their belief that government should be small, without ever indicating what they'd like to see cut.\n\nThis is what I find so... appalling about those who want more and more government programs.  They assume that we, as people, as so cold-hearted that we would not help our neighbors if they are in need.  Just because there isn't a government program doesn't mean that there are not non-profit or even profit-driven programs that fill that need (or would arise to fill that need).  Government does not always equal better.\n\n&gt;You're generally against programs that help or empower the working class, like labor unions, or a minimum wage.\n\nLabor unions no longer help the working class, at least in the working class' opinions.  That's why the south is so resistant to being unionized.  Labor unions now are almost always only negotiating salary and benefits, in exchange for dues.  Those workers are judging the likelihood of getting what is promised versus the cost of the dues and making a decision for themselves.  Why do you not want people making decisions for themselves?  As far as I've read, there are not any Republicans or right-wingers that seek to limit the ability of people to join unions.  Maybe Walker, but public sector unionism is a different beast than private sector.  And I'm sick of discussing minimum wage, so I'll just let you have that.\n\n&gt;You're also generally against limiting the power of big money through programs like the EPA, that seek to deny corporate interests the ability to ruin things that are \"common goods\" for profit.\n\nAgain, why does \"government=good\" in your eyes?  The EPA can do more damage to the working class than any evill right-winger ever could.  Go look at California's central valley and their unemployment problems.  Yes, there are issues of negative externalities, but I think we're pretty well set with what we have now.  The EPA, in many cases, can simply prevent you from using your land and you have few, if any, options.\n\n&gt;So it seems obvious to me that big money is paying a lot of money to get people to think this way.\n\nThen its not working because Romney got trounced.  \n\n&gt;They desperately want people to want \"small government\", they want taxes low on the rich, they want less regulation and oversight.\n\nAgain, why is government=good?  Can government ever be too big?  Can regulation ever be too much?  We regulate the hell out of most industries.  As much as banking gets a bad name, before the financial crisis they were already one of the highest regulated industries out there, maybe second only to oil.  Did that stop anything from happening?\n\nWhat is the harm in going through our layers and layers of regulation and looking to see if they are effective or even needed?  Heck, with laws in general.  Most people commit crimes without ever knowing they did.\n\nOne of the things I recommend everyone doing is to expand their base of reading to include right-leaning, right-wing, left-leaning and left-wing sources regularly.

First of all, you may be conflating Republican with Conservative.  it's only been in the last couple of years where the Conservative movement has taken hold of the Republican party and chased away the more moderate elements of the party.  So to keep toeing the party line, more moderate republicans are now getting grouped in with the TEA party folks.      \n\nthe answer is that they believe it's the right decision.  Economic considerations are consistently cloaked in American ideals, like a sweet coating allows you to swallow a bitter pill.  Thats why the wealthy are rebranded as \"job creators,\" for example.  \n\nIt also explains the appeal of guys like Paul Ryan.  Rolled up sleeves on a plaid shirt, does his workouts every day, not from the elitist east or west coast, just like you or me.  A real populist fellow.  But he's also the economic brain of the Republican party.  He's a persona selling a set of policies that in practice don't match his persona.     \n\nSo these policies that do what you say they do are seen as the right decision, but it has nothing to do with economics.  The policies are framed as a \"state's rights\" issue or a \"freedom\" or \"self-determination\" issue and sold that way.  speaking only a *little bit* speculatively, i'd say that if you're smart enough to understand how this works, you're either already against that particular policy or set of policies or you're complacent in it.\n\nalso, it's not really a \"sophisticated propaganda campaign.\" Conservative ideals and corporate interests naturally line up in a lot of ways (both favor small, toothless government, minimal working class consciousness, et. al.) so for as long as you can hide the consequences it doesn't really have to be much of a campaign nor really very sophisticated.\n\nTL:DR Since economic policies are always wrapped in American ideals, they're rarely pieced apart and therefore the \"right decision,\" though not for economic reasons.

Is there wealth disparity? Of course, but not like this. Firstly, you need to understand that \"wages\" are not the same as \"compensation\". If you include that benefits as part of compensation have risen dramatically, the change of rates is far less severe. \n\nBut what I really want to point to is the claim that the average person would make $90,000. Take a look at the Social Security Administration's data on annual incomes. The median wage is ~27K, while the average is ~41K. This does indicate an right-sloping bell. But 41K is the technical average for the 150 Million+ workers over 15 in the US. \n\n\nThe reason it is not fair to use the 90K figure is because ~90K is reached by diving the entire US GDP by the number of workers. This of course would include benefits that were not included in your original assessment of wage rates. \n\n\n\nhttp://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/netcomp.cgi?year=2011", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8e9je4", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1360727208", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;Productivity and wages used to increase in tandem.

If you want to check my numbers, by all means, google away. \n\nBut right now I'll provide you with a fourth example. I think this example better exposes the hypocrisy on the right, and shows the \"small goverment\" hype to be the sham it really is. \n\nA few years ago we had a health care debate, and a program called the \"Public Option\" became a major part of that debate. \n\nThe public option was the idea that a government program (remember, those lazy, inefficient things) would be created, and that it would have to run itself like a private entity. It would have to pay its own bills, and act as a health insurance company. If people wanted to buy insurance, they could choose to go with the public option. \n\nIf the right really believed the \"lazy and inefficient\" myth, they would have laughed at this prospect. They would have found it hilarious that silly Liberals would want to pit the lean mean private insurance industry against a lazy, inefficient, government run program. It should not have been a sticking point. It would have been a spectacular example of the failure of government for the right, and it would have propped up the belief that the government needs to be shrunk, that its a waste of money etc... if the right actually believed any of that.\n\nInstead what happened was you all shit your pants. The right was terrified of the prospect of this \"lazy and inefficient\" government program stepping into the private marketplace, because frankly, you all knew that it was going to wipe the floor with the insurance industry. The right said as much when it started calling Obama care a \"government takeover of health care\". \n\nSo despite the nonpartisan CBO's claims that the public option would save a huge amount of money, you all opted to only move forward with Obamacare once the threat of a government run competitor in the private marketplace was soundly removed. \n\nI love this example of right wing hypocracy. It was a beautiful thing. I watched as the pundits went from railing about the inefficiency and waste of government, to talking about how the private insurance industry needed saving from government based competition and back.

The IRS and the payroll deduction system allows them to collect.  They also have no advertising or customer retention teams since you don't have a choice in the matter - you have them both and you will like it.\n\nYet you still quoted their administrative costs, ignoring the elephant in the room - they are operating at deficits and will exhaust their funds in the medium-term.  What do you think happens in the private sector if that happens?  Do you think customers are okay with 75% service (as SS is commonly quoted as needing to go to without changes)?  Do you think customers would stick around if their deal changed unilaterally?\n\nTrying to compare government overhead to private overhead is comparing apples and oranges.

You certainly can't point to the money they spend providing their users with actual benefits and claim that there are hidden inefficiencies there. If we're talking about the efficiency of a program, we are talking about how much it costs to administer the program.\n\nTo call a program lazy or inefficient when it has low administrative costs is gibberish. The administrative costs of the program represent the degree to which the programs are \"lazy or inefficient\". \n\nThe fact that congress is not funding them, or that (in social security's case) the surpluses created by those programs were squandered by Republican administrations such that the programs are now considered to be in the red is irrelevant when we're calculating the efficiency of the programs, and these ARE highly efficient programs. \n\nIts a common right wing tactic right?

The IRS and other departments do not allocate a portion of their costs to Social Security and Medicare as they would if it were a private company that must adhere to GAAP.  Medicare and Social Security and any other program that gets the benefit of other's collections has no cost associated with that.  Yes, those are the governmental rules, but its also one of the few places where the government told the accounting profession to bug off - they have the power.\n\n&gt;The fact that congress is not funding them, or that (in social security's case) the surpluses created by those programs were squandered by Republican administrations such that the programs are now considered to be in the red is irrelevant when we're calculating the efficiency of the programs, and these ARE highly efficient programs.\n\nFirst, it wasn't only Republican administrations - every Congress has gotten Social Security to buy Treasuries with its surpluses.  Technically, they are still there, which is why they are not entirely out of funds yet.  Social Security has been a known problem for... well, since 1988 when it was last revised would be a good starting point.  And its not like projections of it going bankrupt didn't start after that.  Medicare as well.

What the USPS is being forced to do would be what in the business world would be called \"best practices\".  The USPS, over the course of the next few years, is required to fund their pension and retiree health promises at 100% their actuarial projections (now, in terms of the accounting, its much more complicated, which is where the 75-year quote comes from).

I think this example better exposes the hypocrisy on the right, and shows the \"small goverment\" hype to be the sham it really is. \n\nA few years ago we had a health care debate, and a program called the \"Public Option\" became a major part of that debate. \n\nThe public option was the idea that a government program (remember, those lazy, inefficient things) would be created, and that it would have to run itself like a private entity. It would have to pay its own bills, and act as a health insurance company. If people wanted to buy insurance, they could choose to go with the public option. \n\nIf the right really believed the \"lazy and inefficient\" myth, they would have laughed at this prospect.

The right was terrified of the prospect of this \"lazy and inefficient\" government program stepping into the private marketplace, because frankly, you all knew that it was going to wipe the floor with the insurance industry. The right said as much when it started calling Obama care a \"government takeover of health care\". \n\nSo despite the nonpartisan CBO's claims that the public option would save a huge amount of money, you all opted to only move forward with Obamacare once the threat of a government run competitor in the private marketplace was soundly removed. \n\nI love this example of right wing hypocracy.

The IRS and other departments do not allocate a portion of their costs to Social Security and Medicare as they would if it were a private company that must adhere to GAAP.  Medicare and Social Security and any other program that gets the benefit of other's collections has no cost associated with that.

What the USPS is being forced to do would be what in the business world would be called \"best practices\".  The USPS, over the course of the next few years, is required to fund their pension and retiree health promises at 100% their actuarial projections (now, in terms of the accounting, its much more complicated, which is where the 75-year quote comes from).    Right now its pretty close to that, which means workers will most likely get what they were promised.  CalPERS, on the other hand, is roughly [60-70% funded (page 5)](http://www.calpers.ca.gov/eip-docs/about/facts/general.pdf).

Nevermind no one would work at that rate, but that's static scoring.  Its a known limitation, but politicians don't like to talk about it.  There is a decent reason - its impossible to come up with a single dynamic projection, mostly because its extremely difficult to know all the variables.

In addition, if it did not, looking at the finances of these Programs, B and C will look to be more profitable than they really are and Program A will look less profitable then it is - after all, its bearing the collection costs of three Programs (granted, its only incremental most likely, but there are still costs there).

I think this example better exposes the hypocrisy on the right, and shows the \"small goverment\" hype to be the sham it really is. \n\nA few years ago we had a health care debate, and a program called the \"Public Option\" became a major part of that debate. \n\nThe public option was the idea that a government program (remember, those lazy, inefficient things) would be created, and that it would have to run itself like a private entity. It would have to pay its own bills, and act as a health insurance company.

The IRS and other departments do not allocate a portion of their costs to Social Security and Medicare as they would if it were a private company that must adhere to GAAP.  Medicare and Social Security and any other program that gets the benefit of other's collections has no cost associated with that.

The USPS, over the course of the next few years, is required to fund their pension and retiree health promises at 100% their actuarial projections (now, in terms of the accounting, its much more complicated, which is where the 75-year quote comes from).    Right now its pretty close to that, which means workers will most likely get what they were promised.  CalPERS, on the other hand, is roughly [60-70% funded (page 5)](http://www.calpers.ca.gov/eip-docs/about/facts/general.pdf).

In addition, if it did not, looking at the finances of these Programs, B and C will look to be more profitable than they really are and Program A will look less profitable then it is - after all, its bearing the collection costs of three Programs (granted, its only incremental most likely, but there are still costs there).

But it would most likely stay there or even fade a bit as people found ways to get around the taxes - negotiate different compensation plans, working less, running more expenses through their personal taxes rather than having the company reimburse them, changing investment options, etc.\n\nBut I also have to hit this:\n\n&gt;Funny how all attempts to increase revenue by conservatives and libertarians involve reducing taxes on the rich. \n\nHere's the share of the tax burden for the [following years](http://www.ntu.org/tax-basics/who-pays-income-taxes.html) for the top 5% (those making more than $120k in '99):\n\n1999 - 55.45%\n2000 - 56.47%\n2001 - 53.25%\n2002 - 53.80%\n2003 - 54.36%\n2004 - 57.13% (This is the first year of the full Bush tax cuts)\n2005 - 59.67%\n2006 - 60.14%\n2007 - 60.63%\n2008 - 58.72% (Year the economy tanked)\n2009 - 58.66%\n\nNow, tell me, if you're going to cut taxes and 5% of Americans shoulder 55+% of the burden, how do you *not* cut taxes for them?  That's why all the discussion of tax cuts almost always revolve around reducing taxes on the rich.  *That's who are mainly paying taxes*.  Just looking at 2009, the top 25% (those making $66k and up) paid 87.30% of all income taxes!

Go back and look at [Pew's research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_tax_cuts#Debate_over_continuation_of_cuts) - the cost of all the tax cuts would be $3.3 trillion.  Raising it only on the rich would cost $2.2 trillion.  That means the rich are only getting 33% of the cost... tell me, what was their percentage of the tax burden?  From [2009](http://www.ntu.org/tax-basics/who-pays-income-taxes.html) (which is actually low compared to the rest of the source) those making over $150k paid nearly 60% of the burden and those making over $350k paid for nearly 36% of the burden.  So we can assume that their share of the tax cuts were not larger than their share of the burden.\n\nIt could be the GOP cares for billionaires more than everyone else, or it could be that they realize that if you're going to cut taxes, the total amount of tax relief is going to be at some sort of parallel to those who pay the taxes.  I mean, unless its really something other than tax relief.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_181ph7", "id": "t1_c8bo6cr", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "slapdashbr", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_181ph7", "selftext": "&gt;percentage of federal personal income tax.

I'm so tired of people claiming that taxes are so progressive when they are not. \n\nLets take this one by one, starting with the easiest:\n\nState Taxes:  Please, tell me how the federal government has *any* control of what the state do with their own taxes?  Same with local.  Bringing those into the calculation is foolish since we're just talking about *federal* taxes.\n\nLets add in the payroll taxes (FICA, Medicare) and all federal taxes - look, its still [quite progressive - go down to \"Effective Federal Tax Burdens (2009)\"](http://www.justfacts.com/taxes.asp#distribution).  The top 1% still pay 30% of the federal tax burden.  But I argue that payroll taxes themselves should be excluded for this as both FICA and Medicare are funding a system which you will later draw out of (deferred, direct benefit for paying), where federal income taxes are at best attached to nothing directly (current, indirect benefit for paying).  But lets ignore that qualm for now.  They paid 30% of all taxes in 2009.  That's great, but we won't know if its regressive just by that, we also need to know their share of the [income](http://taxfoundation.org/article/summary-latest-federal-individual-income-tax-data-0#table1).  Their share of AGI was 16.9%.  They're paying at roughly a double rate relative to their share of income.\n\nNow, will you find exceptions?  Sure.  I can find them in my own practice.  But on the whole, taxes in the US are progressive, at least on the federal level.  But, again, state and local taxes should not be taken into account *because the federal government has no control over that*.

Cut spending, which lowers revenue but causes huge amounts of human suffering but cutting essential services for people right when they need them the most. \n\n3. Stimulate the economy such that the economy is producing more wealth, and fewer people are using government social services. \n\nThat video promotes #2, which causes the most human suffering for real Americans out there. It promotes #2 at a time when tax rates on the rich are near historic lows. It could have promoted #3, and attempted to keep long term spending and taxes at current levels for the price of a one time large jump in the debt, but the makers of that video chose not to go with that. \n\nThe fact is raising taxes on the wealth directly solves more than a third of the debt problem directly, even when using 2009's numbers (the video chose that year because the debt was higher than other years so the argument that taxing the rich can't fix the deficit was stronger). Having a deficit isn't a problem, its the ratio of GDP to debt that is problematic, you don't want that to go down. With a 400 billion dollar deficit, our GDP/debt ratio doesn't change one way or the other, its a sustainable deficit. \n\nSo with 2009's numbers from the video, you solve 4/11ths of the total deficit problem.

Raise taxes to increase revenue, which directly solves the problem.\n\n2. Cut spending, which lowers revenue but causes huge amounts of human suffering but cutting essential services for people right when they need them the most. \n\n3. Stimulate the economy such that the economy is producing more wealth, and fewer people are using government social services. \n\nThat video promotes #2, which causes the most human suffering for real Americans out there. It promotes #2 at a time when tax rates on the rich are near historic lows. It could have promoted #3, and attempted to keep long term spending and taxes at current levels for the price of a one time large jump in the debt, but the makers of that video chose not to go with that. \n\nThe fact is raising taxes on the wealth directly solves more than a third of the debt problem directly, even when using 2009's numbers (the video chose that year because the debt was higher than other years so the argument that taxing the rich can't fix the deficit was stronger). Having a deficit isn't a problem, its the ratio of GDP to debt that is problematic, you don't want that to go down. With a 400 billion dollar deficit, our GDP/debt ratio doesn't change one way or the other, its a sustainable deficit. \n\nSo with 2009's numbers from the video, you solve 4/11ths of the total deficit problem. Today raising taxes on the wealthy to 1960's levels would nearly bring the deficit to 400 billion by itself. \n\nThere's a lot of money out there that wants people to believe certain things, and the idea that taxing the rich is useless is one of the things they want people to believe the most. The power base of the financial elites is largely dependent on having low taxes, so they pay a lot of money to promote videos like this.

It postulates that no tax revenue will be raised at the extreme tax rates of 0% and 100% and that there must be at least one rate where tax revenue would be a non-zero maximum.\n\n&gt;The Laffer curve is typically represented as a graph which starts at 0% tax with zero revenue, rises to a maximum rate of revenue at an intermediate rate of taxation, and then falls again to zero revenue at a 100% tax rate.

It postulates that no tax revenue will be raised at the extreme tax rates of 0% and 100% and that there must be at least one rate where tax revenue would be a non-zero maximum.\n\n&gt;The Laffer curve is typically represented as a graph which starts at 0% tax with zero revenue, rises to a maximum rate of revenue at an intermediate rate of taxation, and then falls again to zero revenue at a 100% tax rate.

They're on the rocks already, and there are a lot of people that will vote republican no matter what, but this might force them into a minority position for a very long time.

This is superfluous since the budget was already passed. \n\nThe summer before last, republicans started using this as a means of holding the country hostage. You might recall us losing our AAA credit rating from moody's. That was the fallout of the first time the Republicans held the economic welfare of the country hostage and threatened to fuck us all over if they didn't get their way about various issues (extending the Bush era tax cuts for instance). \n\nAnyway, since then, every 6 months or so, we've been hitting the debt limit again. This is because spending has gone up as a result of high unemployment, which was itself a result of republicans and the financial elites crashing and burning the economy, then fighting tooth and nail to ensure that any attempt at fixing things (i.e. The stimulus) would be inadequate.\n\nSo this summer, Obama and the republicans came to an agreement. They punted the problem till after the election. They decided to install automatic drastic spending cuts across the board, and tied the Bush Tax cuts to it such that taxes will rise on pretty much everyone at the same time. This agreement was a \"bad deal\" because it gives disproportionate power to the republican controlled house, and because it was a \"deal\" people forget that this entire mess was created and forced upon us by the Republican controlled douche-bag traitorous (hey, holding the well being of the US hostage to benefit the elites is treason in my opinion) house. \n\nThe entire idea of coming to a deal with Obama was genius politically, because it attacks Obama where he's weakest, at his willingness to compromise. If Obama wanted a chicken sandwich, and the republicans wanted him to eat a shit sandwich. Obama would compromise with them and end up eating a chickenshit sandwich. All men have their weak points, for many Presidents its having a mistress. For Obama, its wanting to fucking compromise. I don't know what's wrong with him. I'd much rather he fucked around on Michelle than fuck us all through compromises, but he's the president we have.\n\nSo now the time limit for congress to fix the budget (i.e. the cliff) is coming and everyone's pissed about it. Republicans because taxes will go up if nothing is done. Democrats because serious cuts to important programs across the board will be put in place if nothing is done. \n\nIt is a bullshit catastrophe literally created by douchebag republicans in the house over a technicality in the way government works (budgets don't automatically change the debt limit).
