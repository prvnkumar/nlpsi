Frank J. Wilson investigated Capone's income tax violations, which the government decided was more likely material for a conviction. In 1931 Capone was indicted for income tax evasion and various violations of the Volstead Act (Prohibition) at the Chicago Federal Building in the courtroom of Judge James Herbert Wilkerson. His attorneys made a plea deal, but the presiding judge warned he might not follow the sentencing recommendation from the prosecution. Capone withdrew his plea of guilty.\n\n&gt;His attempt to bribe and intimidate the potential jurors was discovered by Ness's men, The Untouchables. The venire (jury pool) was switched with one from another case, and Capone was stymied. Following a long trial, on October 17 the jury returned a mixed verdict, finding Capone guilty of five counts of tax evasion and failing to file tax returns (the Volstead Act violations were dropped). The judge sentenced him to 11 years imprisonment, at the time the longest tax evasion sentence ever given, along with heavy fines, and liens were filed against his various properties. His appeals of both the conviction and the sentence were denied. One of the Capone properties seized by the federal government was an armored limousine. The limousine was later used to protect President Franklin D. Roosevelt after the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\n&gt;In ... \n`(Truncated at 1500 characters)`\n\n---\n\n[^(about AutoWikibot)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| *^\\/u/xrelaht ^can ^reply ^with ^'delete'. ^Will ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less.*  ^| ^[**Summon**](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1wc2n8", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cf17026", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1390941562", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "xrelaht", "id": "t1_cf16zzg", "parent_id": "t1_cf109mp", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1435514145, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ah, tax violation: [backup charge for over 80 years!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Capone#Conviction_and_imprisonment)", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1wc2n8", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cf16zzg", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1390941557", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Xing_the_Rubicon", "id": "t1_cf109mp", "parent_id": "t1_cf0x1q0", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1432144732, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cf109mp", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1390927948", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "jimbles1", "id": "t1_cf0x1q0", "parent_id": "t1_cf0kp4s", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1432143067, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1wc2n8", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cf0x1q0", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1390919881", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;Gay marriage, a civil-rights issue, could be legalized nationally by the federal gov't. \n\nThis depends on what you mean by \"legalized\".

Really, it's quite a clever strategy. Every time Obamacare is used, typically in a derisive fashion, \"OBAMA\" is the central part of the word, and the goal is a negative association. (And we saw how all that played out in the 2012 election, what with complaining about Obamacare being the single issue the GOP was reduced to...)\n\nPersonally, I use \"ACA\". Sometimes I go full bore and throw out \"PPACA\", usually when I'm gonna stress the whole \"Patient Protection\" part. I tend to say \"Obamacare\" only when I'm conversing with an adamant right winger, because I know for a fact the word bothers them a *whole* lot more than it does me. You might call it \"trying to gain leverage\", but to that I humbly reply *I don't need any help gaining leverage over somebody arguing the GOP bullshit party line*. I do it to mock them, plain and simple\n\nSo the question remains: Does saying the word \"Obamacare\" make me, or the biggest GOP douchebag in the bunch, a racist? Of course not! What makes the GOP douchebag a racist is all the other shit they've had to say about our Kenyan Muslim bone in the nose fried chicken eating food stamp giving jive talkin BIG OLE BLACK MAN IN ARE WHITE HOUSE!!!! \n\nIf that's not enough for you, just in case you've missed what's been going on for the last five years, how about the way the GOP has for literally decades condoned systematic oppression of people who just don't look (or act, or talk, or worship, or earn...) like them? So really, even \"racist\" is too narrow a term to fully describe the mind set of some of those people.\n\n&gt;So, your attempts to call everyone who uses the term \"Obamacare\" a racist are bullshit.\n\nQuite the strawman you've constructed there. I never said \"everyone who says Obamacare is a racist\". Show me where I did? I said the GOP is chock full of fucking racists, which point you readily conceded. So get off my ass. I'll continue to refer to the GOP as the party of discrimination until they stop being the party of discrimination. I'll take every opportunity to broadly twist that knife as deep and hard as I can, whether it be about their attempts to disenfranchise black voters, or to pass laws that demand Hispanics be stopped randomly and forced to prove they \"belong\" here, or their pig headed insistence that their right to practice their religion trumps the right of some homo to not be persecuted, or some other *not* to be able to practice theirs...\n\n&gt;Seriously, everyone is aware of the racist element within the GOP, but people like you really piss me off because you are just throwing accusations around with absolutely no basis in reality\n\nNow that we've determined that I never did, indeed, accuse everybody who says \"Obamacare\" of being racist, is the above still relevant? No matter. You do understand that in one breath you gently concede that it's common knowledge the GOP is chock full of racists (\"Seriously, everyone is aware of the racist element within the GOP...\"), and in the next you accuse me of \"throwing accusations around with absolutely no basis in reality\"?\n\nWhich is it?

The abortion debate is probably the best example of this: both sides are \"pro\" something (because being against things plays badly) and both sides are in favor of something that sounds pretty nice.\n\n\"Pro Life\" (hey, who doesn't like life?)\n\n\"Pro Choice\" (choice, freedom, these sound nice too)\n\nOf course people who oppose someone who's \"Pro Life\" are \"Anti-Life\" (yikes!) and people who oppose someone who's \"Pro Choice\" are \"Anti-Choice\" (sounds ominous).  You'll actually see \"anti-choice\" batted around by the abortion-rights crowd from time to time as it sounds a little more plausible as a phrase than \"anti-life\" which has kind of vague sci-fi/Fifth Element feel to it.  \n\nIn any case, the right made a decision back during the Clinton years to brand the Clinton healthcare plan \"Hillarycare\" since First Lady Hillary Clinton was so involved in the legislative process and she didn't play quite as well with certain demographics as her husband did.  \"Hillarycare\" made the Clinton healthcare law sound bitchy and controlling and sort-of-eggheady since that's how a lot of folks saw Hillary herself.  \n\nIt worked; and the Clinton healthcare law went down in flames and because it was so successfully tied to Hillary she was politically neutered to a great extent.  \n\nThe GOP thought they'd try the same thing with Obama.  Lashing Obama to the PPACA was a gambit intended to see that Obama's political fortunes would be tied to a healthcare law which would be a real challenge to get through Congress.  \n\nThis was probably exacerbated by the Democrats failure to come up with a better name for the bill.  Laws like the PATRIOT Act (a backronym if ever I've seen one) are difficult to oppose precisely because of their name.  Who wants to come out in opposition to something that sounds as red-white-and-blue as that?\n\nThe Democrats tried -- \"Affordable Care Act\" carries within its name the assumption that the law will make healthcare affordable, defines as a problem the notion that healthcare isn't affordable now, and seeks to identify opponents as people who don't want you to have affordable healthcare (which sounds like a pretty bad thing to oppose) but it lacks style.  It lacks zing.  It lacks sticking power.\n\nAnd it's a mouthful.  So \"Affordable Care Act\" or -- even worse -- \"The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\" got shortened to \"ACA\" or \"PPACA\" which stripped it of its emotional baggage.  That left the right's \"Obamacare\" meme ready to take hold.\n\nAnd that was carved into stone when Obama himself began referring to the program by that name too.  The way he did it was hokey and awkward but suddenly you had both Democrats and Republicans calling it \"Obamacare\" and that's going to give it some real staying power.\n\nSo now I would expect that the moniker \"Obamacare\" will stick so long as President Obama remains reasonably popular within the Democratic Party, particularly if the right maintains its dislike of the law for the foreseeable future.  \n\nYou may see it fall out of use if the GOP decides to abandon its opposition to the law or if the Democrats find that Obama's name actually hobbles the law somehow (maybe a major scandal late in his second term) but otherwise it'll stick around, particularly because, unlike the other major aspects of the US social safety net, the PPACA has no other short, snappy name.  \n\nSo long as our media needs to talk about Obamacare they'll call it by that name simply because it's quick, it's well recognized, and it gets the point across... and that's all the enforcement the meme could need.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1p0lus", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd2684i", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1383062227", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "stickied": false, "title": "Is the name \"ObamaCare\" here to stay?", "media": null, "base10id": 102484900, "id": "t3_1p0lus", "score": 18, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 3, "saved": false, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1p0lus/is_the_name_obamacare_here_to_stay/", "name": "t3_1p0lus", "created": 1382492473, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1p0lus/is_the_name_obamacare_here_to_stay/", "author_flair_text": null, "author": "hungryhungryME", "created_utc": 1382488873, "distinguished": null, "num_comments": 26, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "ups": 21}

There are major parts of the law I don't agree with and want changed, however I would gladly take the ACA over what we have as it is certainly a step in the right direction. This is a stance that many take, so much so that there were enough of us to outvote those of you who were against it.\n\n&gt;Obamacare was sold on lies? Namely the fact that nobody(outside of federal employees) is allowed to keep their own plan?\n\nI don't know why Obama made that claim, because the government cannot dictate the free market in that fashion. If they did, or passed a law to allow them to determine what plans could be offered and at what costs, then there would be no reason not to go to a single-payer plan.\n\nNevertheless, that was hardly a \"pillar\" of the law. Getting access to healthcare for as many of the 50 million US citizens without it as possible, that was. Stopping insurers from denying coverage because of a pre-existing condition, that was. Maintaining the status quo for everything/everyone else, that was not.\n\nAs a side note, it's surprising to see conservatives so vehemently disagree with an idea that was first presented by a Republican, and a Republican who was a Presidential candidate no less!\n\n&gt;It's not even fully implemented yet, and costs are rising across the board. That's considered failure.\n\nIts implementation has only just begun, therefore any immediate conclusions you can draw are weak at best. We cannot know whether the ACA will be a success or a failure until it has been tested. But when the time comes to ultimately determine if the ACA was beneficial or not, it will be professionals who make that decision.\n\n&gt;So what, only MotherJones is ok to you? /eyeroll.\n\nI'm sorry, have I said anything that I can't support on my own? Have I been continuously repeating invalid talking points from biased news networks?\n\nNo, I haven't. However, declaring the ACA as \"failed politics\" **is** an invalid talking point from a biased news network, such as but not limited to FOX News. They started claiming his policies as \"failures\" only days after he first took office in 2008 and haven't stopped since. So yes, you have been mindlessly spouting their talking points and therefore have no ground to stand on and be condescending.\n\n&gt;No, congress/senate/politicians are specifically exempted from Obamacare.\n\n[I'm not going to waste any of my time arguing against lies, please read for yourself.](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/25/fact-check-congress-staff-are-exempt-from-obamacare/)\n\n&gt;Oh, and just in case you're not entirely clear, the majority of people oppose Obamacare, period.\n\nYea...

For one reason or another... perhaps the problem is the corporations/lobbists are influencing those politicians, maybe it's just that those politicians can't accept a law proposed by a democrat (add adjectives as you please to this statement, but I won't get into racial motives), maybe those politicians are worried about being primaried... it doesn't matter.

Basically, it contends that the \"incumbent advantage\" has nothing to do with the media purchased for them with corporate donations and lobbyists' \"campaign contributions\", or that more principled candidates cannot afford to run for national office for lack of this funding. This may be the case in some alternate reality, where politicians are not dependent for their political lives upon those \"campaign contributions,\" but in America this is not the case. Candidates are selected by well endowed interests, and the electorate has virtually nothing to say about who they're offered on election day.

We were the primary founders of it, along with it's progenitor, the League of Nations, and we have always acted as we saw fit, whether the UN agreed or disagreed. To boot, it's headquarters are in *New York City*, on American land. Plus, it's other 'arms', like the World Bank, and the IMF, are both headquartered in the US, and heavily influenced by American politics and the like. \n\n&gt;Second, increases in wealth and interdepence make sure we rely on trading and cooperation in stead of conquering each other. \n\nGenerally, this would be attributed to American naval dominance, allowing for the free-est trade, especially on the seas, since the age of British naval dominance. Other American 'policing' efforts are similarly responsible. \n\n&gt;Also important is a change in norms and practices which ensure we don't beat eachothers heads in when we have an argument (and yet the USA ranks among the highest in civilian interpersonal violence- despite being a 'hegemony' internationally). \n\nInternal affairs of a nation, and how it's power and actions figure into the global community don't overlap 100%. For one, much of America's social issues and violence stems from the still-present specter of slavery, Jim Crow laws, and segregation. You don't spend the vast majority of your nation's history attempting to essentially 'drown' an entire racial group without expecting any repercussions. A similar society is South Africa, in which apartheid has essentially resulted in a great deal of the crime in their modern-day society. Certainly, in both nations, there's some individual-level, and inter-community issues, but when you spend centuries fucking over blacks, and then wonder why black crime rates are sky-high, it's kind of fucking obvious.\n\n&gt;You're confusing correlation with causation. Besides that, you cannot say the world is better off when violence is essentially monopolized by a global superpower just because there is less violence, which was also the case in corrupt communist regimes.\n\nA monopoly on violence is also essential to a harmonious state, and sub-international affairs. Cops can be good or bad, but a strong police force generally helps prevent petty crime, at the least. \n\nAdditionally, while the US is not a 'perfect' country, no nation is, and any of it's 'excesses' are farts in a hurricane compared to what the British, Chinese, Russians, and Japanese do, and have done.

And even though I know this, I can't correct that error. There's a very lengthy process of notifying them and the state. By the time it gets corrected, 6 months can easily go by. And that's if I catch it, and if I even know the person. Do you know how many people I *don't* know? There could be a whole bus of people voting in two places and we would have no way of even knowing because of how obsolete our system is. And even if I *did* know someone who came in who is registered somewhere else, I have to let them vote. There's really nothing I can do about it. As far as the \"official\" paperwork I have is concerned, they're allowed to. If I suspect something is fishy, the best I can do is make them sign an affidavit, but then I'm getting close to \"discriminating\". Which leads me to the second reason: resources. Do you have any idea how expensive it is to bring litigation against someone? Even if we did have reasonable suspicion to believe someone committed voter fraud, we'd go bankrupt just trying to prove it. Court costs and attorney fees would just drain our budget on prosecuting one person. And we might not even win! But you're taking the realities of the situation and using them (wrongly) as evidence that a problem doesn't exist. \n&gt;But seriously, please please please give me an example of voter fraud? \n\nGiven the antiquated system and procedural roadblocks, I'd abandon this type of argument from now on. I live in a major Democrat state (CT), but not one Democrat Registrar I know is for loosening voter laws. This is a position that's more popular with people who don't actually have to work on the implementation side of voting.

You seem to believe that because there aren't many cases of voter fraud, that it doesn't happen. [I'm sure you know this is a logical fallacy, and that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Absence_of_evidence) But in case you don't, I'll do my best to shred some light on the subject. There are two main reasons you won't find many cases of voter fraud. \n\nOne, and most importantly, the system we use to keep track of who is registered where is incredibly out of date. Just a cursory browsing of who is currently registered and allowed to vote in our town, I found 20 people I *personally* know who do not live in our town anymore, and are registered in another town. And even though I know this, I can't correct that error. There's a very lengthy process of notifying them and the state. By the time it gets corrected, 6 months can easily go by. And that's if I catch it, and if I even know the person. Do you know how many people I *don't* know? There could be a whole bus of people voting in two places and we would have no way of even knowing because of how obsolete our system is. And even if I *did* know someone who came in who is registered somewhere else, I have to let them vote. There's really nothing I can do about it. As far as the \"official\" paperwork I have is concerned, they're allowed to. If I suspect something is fishy, the best I can do is make them sign an affidavit, but then I'm getting close to \"discriminating\". Which leads me to the second reason: resources. Do you have any idea how expensive it is to bring litigation against someone? Even if we did have reasonable suspicion to believe someone committed voter fraud, we'd go bankrupt just trying to prove it. Court costs and attorney fees would just drain our budget on prosecuting one person. And we might not even win! But you're taking the realities of the situation and using them (wrongly) as evidence that a problem doesn't exist. \n&gt;But seriously, please please please give me an example of voter fraud? \n\nGiven the antiquated system and procedural roadblocks, I'd abandon this type of argument from now on. I live in a major Democrat state (CT), but not one Democrat Registrar I know is for loosening voter laws. This is a position that's more popular with people who don't actually have to work on the implementation side of voting.

You seem to believe that because there aren't many cases of voter fraud, that it doesn't happen. [I'm sure you know this is a logical fallacy, and that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Absence_of_evidence) But in case you don't, I'll do my best to shred some light on the subject. There are two main reasons you won't find many cases of voter fraud. \n\nOne, and most importantly, the system we use to keep track of who is registered where is incredibly out of date. Just a cursory browsing of who is currently registered and allowed to vote in our town, I found 20 people I *personally* know who do not live in our town anymore, and are registered in another town. And even though I know this, I can't correct that error. There's a very lengthy process of notifying them and the state. By the time it gets corrected, 6 months can easily go by. And that's if I catch it, and if I even know the person. Do you know how many people I *don't* know? There could be a whole bus of people voting in two places and we would have no way of even knowing because of how obsolete our system is. And even if I *did* know someone who came in who is registered somewhere else, I have to let them vote. There's really nothing I can do about it. As far as the \"official\" paperwork I have is concerned, they're allowed to. If I suspect something is fishy, the best I can do is make them sign an affidavit, but then I'm getting close to \"discriminating\". Which leads me to the second reason: resources. Do you have any idea how expensive it is to bring litigation against someone? Even if we did have reasonable suspicion to believe someone committed voter fraud, we'd go bankrupt just trying to prove it. Court costs and attorney fees would just drain our budget on prosecuting one person. And we might not even win! But you're taking the realities of the situation and using them (wrongly) as evidence that a problem doesn't exist. \n&gt;But seriously, please please please give me an example of voter fraud? \n\nGiven the antiquated system and procedural roadblocks, I'd abandon this type of argument from now on. I live in a major Democrat state (CT), but not one Democrat Registrar I know is for loosening voter laws. This is a position that's more popular with people who don't actually have to work on the implementation side of voting.

Divided by 2 to remove children, as you did, and multiply by .25 for the 25% that are missing IDs, and you already have 1.5%, without even taking into account elderly or young people without IDs. \n\nJust to touch on young people, the actual percentage of childern under the age of 15 is closer to 20% than 50. Add another 5% for children 15-18. So in reality, you have closer to 2.25% of the population disenfranchised due to lack of IDs in the black community.

One very important aspect was that it moved thousands and thousands of poor, angry young men out of densely populated areas in the big cities of the country. It's not well known or well reported, but the Fascist movement that eventually prevailed in Germany and other Axis countries was beginning to gain a foothold in some communities in America as well. The plan was not only to employ these potentially dangerous groups of men, but to spread them out and prevent the sort of momentum that allowed for the rapid rise to power that lead to the Third Reich situation. It was an extremely clever move, but one that doesn't really seem to be applicable in todays economic climate.\n\nI would love more money to be pumped in to our infrastructure, but a massive project on the scale of the CCC or WPA is really over the top considering a 7.5% unemployment rate that shows slow but steady improvement.

The simple truth is that if we had 7.5% unemployment back in 2009, we would be *freaking out*. By the standards of past recessions, 7.5% unemployment is a total disaster that should be met with a massive government response.\n\nAnd yet the fact that the unemployment rate is dropping has served not just as justification to maintain the status quo- but to *radically* scale back our response to the crisis.\n\n&gt;artificially inexpensive work puts the real businesses out...it does no good to bump them out of business for a few years of government welfare labor projects\n\nWhat businesses are you talking about?

A steady influx of labor powers industry, and a democratic government and decent social infrastructure draws the best and brightest from around the world. I think people see that to draw the outside talent that they want, the perception of certain areas of Europe as xenophobic or racist needs to improve.\n\nAnd to answer the question of why Europe needs to be \"diverse\" and \"multicultural\"...well, basically, there are a handful of places that people choose to emigrate to. Who wants to move to Saudi Arabia? People move for economic opportunity and they move to find a more free and just society. \n\nSo, Europe is a big one, and North America is the other big one. The difference between the two is that North America, for all of the racism and bigotry in it's history, has a sort of process for absorbing new immigrant groups. It's not always smooth or easy, but huge quantities of Irish, German, Greek, Italian, Chinese, African, Japanese, and now increasingly Indian and Middle-Eastern immigrants have been full integrated into the mix. It's strange...the immigration seems to come in waves from certain regions, and within one or two generations those waves are accepted. \n\nThe group coming in at this moment causing a stir is Mexican and Central American...and I can tell you as a Texan who works with and around both white Texans and legal and illegal Mexican immigrants, there is very little observable racism on the ground (now, our politicians present a different image, of course).\n\nOn the other hand, Europe is divided into countries predominantly made up of people claiming one ethnic identity. A common question in the US is \"when did your people get here?\" I have the feeling that if I asked that to an Italian, the answer would be \"we've always been here.\" Or maybe \"have you heard of the Roman Empire?\" It's harder to integrate new cultures when your culture is so old, so well-defined and so ingrained in life. \n\nHaving said that, immigration is very clearly the key to prosperity (and a lot of Europe could use a little bit of that right now...) and many recognize this and are pushing to overthrow the old notions of ethnic identity.
