{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Ultimately, a very large portion of the American service industry in the Southwest depends on a very vulnerable population that they can exploit. With a highly mobile, very vulnerable, and constantly increasing population of exploitable workers, employers can hire people for far less than minimum wage, deny them benefits, work them longer hours, and in dangerous conditions.\n\nThe exploitable quality of this population is \"deportability.\" E-verify and most other government programs for ensuring that employers hire documented workers are intentionally designed to put all the onus on the workers and not on the employers. If the worker gives a forged document with someone else's information on it, the employer can blithely punch it in, and hire the worker, even if it's an obvious forgery. But because the employer knows it's a forgery, they can fire workers whenever they want.\n\nThis isn't a good economic system. Besides the fact that we believe it is a moral good of society to have employers comply with basic human rights -- paying a minimum/living wage, safe working conditions, benefits when you're full time -- it's not good economics. It increase unemployment, because a big agri-farm can hire 10 tomato pickers for 80 hours a week and pay them nearly nothing, whereas if it complied with state, local, and federal law, it would have to hire more since it couldn't work them so hard.\n\nSimilarly, it depresses wages. If I'm a restaurant and I've decided I'm going to do everything legal, but there are other restaurants out there who are paying dishwashers below minimum wage, as a legal owner, I'm going to depress my wages as low as I legally can.\n\nIt also creates a giant black market of immigration documents, gangs, and other violence. If I can't make a living wage doing one, or two, or three jobs because I'm undocumented, joining a gang and dealing drugs is a darn good way. And even if I don't want to do that, if I get thrown in State of Federal prison for a year or two due to immigration issues, I'm likely to join a prison-based gang for protection, like La Eme, La Nuestra Familia, Texas Syndicate, El Barrio Azteca, or gangs that aren't *based* in prison, but have strong prison ties, like MS-13, 18th Street, or the Latin Kings. Once I get out, if I'm not deported, I stick with my gang and often cause more crime. If I *am* deported, I might still end up going back to my main country and joining its gang there, and participating in the huge amounts of gang violence in my home country. *See* Mexico, Guatamala, Honduras, for some examples. That of course, fuels more drug trafficking north towards the United States.\n\n***\n\nAt the end of the day, these people are coming here for opportunity. By exploiting them, we hurt them, we hurt our economy, and we hurt our civic society. Are there some \"pluses?\" Sure: some businesses get to make a lot of money. A lot of our fruits and vegetables are a lot cheaper. But the cost? I don't think it's worth it.\n\nPluses of easier immigration? Besides eliminating the exploitation of these workers, there's more tax revenue. Although most undocumented immigrants who work legitimate jobs *do* pay taxes already, although using false documentation, this would bring a vast number of people under the tax umbrella. When people can make more money, pay more taxes, and have more to spend, it's good for the economy. Secondly, it decreases healthcare costs, because more people will be getting insurance rather than using the ER. Thirdly, well, it's just the right thing to do.
