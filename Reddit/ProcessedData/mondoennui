It helps to have congressional members on staff, but lobbying groups are also successful because they often succeed in portraying their interests as similar to the interests of constitutients in the Congressperson's state/district. If some new regulation is going to cost a labor group or a company or something, they'll tell the Congressman it hurts jobs, etc and will lead to unemployment in the area. No Congressperson wants high unemployment in their district. Reddit seems to think lobbyists literally hand bags of cash to politicians, but this is rarely the case and is actually very illegal. Lobbying isn't just money - it's access and voter support as well.\n\n2. Third parties, as others have noted, have existed in the US for a long time. As recently as the 1990s, the Reform Party candidate (Ross Perot) was threatening to win the Presidential Election. The US electoral system, however, requires a majority vote in the electoral college to actually win, so if a third party does rise it typically spells the end of one of the two other major parties. This happened to the Whigs, Federalists, anti-Federalists, etc.\n\n3. If you really can't see any ideological differences between the Democrats and Republicans on issues like health care, taxes, and spending I feel bad for you. You also incorrectly attribute church power to money, when I would argue it has far more to do with mobilization. Churchgoers vote consistently, and often are willing to dedicate a lot of time and effort to a cause or candidate. \n\n4. A high minority turnout was important, yes.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE SITUATION IN THE SENKAKU ISLANDS.\n\n    It is the sense of the Senate that--\n\n        (1) the East China Sea is a vital part of the maritime commons of Asia, including critical sea lanes of communication and commerce that benefit all nations of the Asia-Pacific region;\n\n        (2) the peaceful settlement of territorial and jurisdictional disputes in the East China Sea requires the exercise of self-restraint by all parties in the conduct of activities that would complicate or escalate disputes and destabilize the region, and differences should be handled in a constructive manner consistent with universally recognized principles of customary international law;\n\n        (3) while the United States takes no position on the ultimate sovereignty of the Senkaku islands, the United States acknowledges the administration of Japan over the Senkaku Islands;\n\n        (4) The unilateral action of a third party will not affect the United States\u2019 acknowledgment of the administration of Japan over the Senkaku Islands;\n\n        (5) the United States has national interests in freedom of navigation, the maintenance of peace and stability, respect for international law, and unimpeded lawful commerce;\n\n        (6) the United States supports a collaborative diplomatic process by claimants to resolve territorial disputes without coercion, and opposes efforts at coercion, the threat of use of force, or use of force by any claimant in seeking to resolve sovereignty and territorial issues in the East China Sea; and\n\n        (7) the United States reaffirms its commitment to the Government of Japan under Article V of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security that \u2018[e]ach Party recognizes that an armed attack against either Party in the territories under the administration of Japan would be dangerous to its own peace and safety and declares that it would act to meet the common danger in accordance with its constitutional provisions and processes\u2019.\"", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_14mnru", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7ehdeh", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1355180725", "ups": 5, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_14mnru", "id": "t1_c7eigfb", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I would wonder, why then it was included in the NDAA, if it does nothing to modify existing foreign policy or treaties.", "id": "t1_c7eix29", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "mondoennui", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c7ejirq", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_14mnru", "selftext": "That is for the political stage and attention.
