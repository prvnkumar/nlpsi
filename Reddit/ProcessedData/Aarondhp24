The ONLY opinion we should formulate from what we know is that no one saw what happened and so we don't know.\n\nWe know things in hindsight like George Zimmerman was wrong for carrying a gun in direct violation of the neighborhood watch handbook. A group of people he supposedly was \"captain\" of.\n\nWe know that Treyvon Martins pictures on facebook had some of him looking very \"ghetto\" as people on the right would say, and that carries a LOT of negative racial connotation with it.\n\nWe're ALL basing opinions of these guys based on little to no knowledge about their personal character or the situation itself.\n\n\nTo answer your question simply, people on the right find it easier to believe that Treyvon Martin was a hoodlum, and people on the left find it easier to believe that George Zimmerman was a bad racist guy on a power trip.\n\nBut which is actually TRUE?!\n\nWouldn't we all be surprised to learn Treyvon began CHASING Zimmerman? Wouldn't we be surprised to learn that moments before Treyvon died, Zimmerman exclaimed \"Prepare to die Nigger!\"\n\nWe just don't know what happened. So people choose the side that is easiest for them to digest. \n\nI don't know what happened, and I'll leave it to the lawyers to hash out this stand your ground bullshit.

The law goes out of its way to forbid accessories that make firearms easier to aim (and therefor safer to bystanders,) such as the barrel shrouds, forward vertical grips, pistol style handles on rifles. This is the rough equivalent to outlawing rear view mirrors on automobiles on grounds of their \"tactical\" appearance.\n\nYet this is what is being proposed... again!  Haha\n\n&gt; Other rules in the legislation just make firearms more difficult to use: magazine release buttons that require the user to insert a pointy tipped object to release the magazine, and external \"safeties\" for example. A safely operated firearm is one that can be handled simply and effectively with a minimal use of fine motor skills.\n\nOnly if the weapon has a pistol grip.  I really don't see this as a solution because there are so many other options for an active shooter to choose.  Not to mention: it handicaps the rest of us gun owners.\n\n&gt; For example, one such advancement in safety that every manufacturer should be utilizing is the advent of light weight firing pins that lack the inertia to discharge the firearm when dropped, high visibility sites that make it easier to be sure of your target in low light situations, and more reliable feed lips on magazines.\n\nMost of these things are already implemented.  Guns rarely, if never, go off when dropped.  Modern Glocks are some of the safest and reliable firearms out there.\n\nAs for sights, that's a user preference.\n\n&gt; In conclusion, making firearms more difficult to use safely is simple asinine legislation, and it is wrong to celebrate such \"gun manufacture regulation\" as though it's akin to other safet regulation like airbags in automobiles.\n\nAgreed.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1542zv", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7l4zjc", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1356293091", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "parent_id": "t1_c7j8odm", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430753540, "controversiality": 0, "body": "The real offensive aspect of the 1994 Assault Weapon Plan (and similar rules from the ATF) is that the regulations it imposed were in almost all cases either cosmetic or detrimental to gun safety.    The law goes out of its way to forbid accessories that make firearms easier to aim (and therefor safer to bystanders,) such as the barrel shrouds, forward vertical grips, pistol style handles on rifles.  This is the rough equivalent to outlawing rear view mirrors on automobiles on grounds of their \"tactical\" appearance.\n\nOther rules in the legislation just make firearms more difficult to use: magazine release buttons that require the user to insert a pointy tipped object to release the magazine, and external \"safeties\" for example.   A safely operated firearm is one that can be handled simply and effectively with a minimal use of fine motor skills. \n\nThe worst part of this legislation is that it reflects a very poor understanding of firearm mechanics by the very people sponsoring the bills.   If, instead, the law were written like automobile regulation - encouraging or mandating actual improvements to firearm safety that are being pioneered in some areas of the industry, then they would be much more palletable to gun owners.\n\nBy way of examples, some advancements in safety that every manufacturer should be utilizing include the advent of light weight firing pins that lack the inertia to discharge the firearm when dropped, high visibility sights that make it easier to be sure of your target in low light situations, more reliable feed lips on magazines that prevent failure to feeds, and multistage recoil springs that soften felt recoil without adversely effecting the feed of the next round.  (failure to feed a round completely into the chamber regularly causes catastrophic firearm failure and explosion)\n\nIn conclusion, making firearms more difficult to use safely is simple asinine legislation, and it is wrong to celebrate such \"gun manufacture regulation\" as though it's akin to other safety regulation like airbags in automobiles.\n\nEdit: sorry to place this here, I realize you are not supporting this law and that you probably agree with me.

I personally believe compulsory military service runs contrary to the foundations of liberty and freedom upon which our nation is built.  I personally believe that firearms training should be taught in schools in the following manner:\n\n* To those children of a young age, you must train them on what to do if they come upon a firearm that is unattended.  You train them to leave it alone and tell an adult.  Never to touch it.  You reinforce this training by rewarding positive behavior and punishing negative (candy for those who do right, punishment for those who do wrong).\n\n* As children get older, you teach them how to properly handle a firearm.  You teach them the FOUR RULES, 1. Treat the gun as if it's always loaded, 2. Never point the gun at someone or something you do not intend to shoot, 3. Never place your finger on the trigger until you are absolutely ready to fire, 4. Beware of your target and what's behind it.\n\n* As they get even older (like High School), you can begin teaching marksmanship basics, and other forms of shooting, like sport shooting.\n\nThis way, you remove the 'mystery' of the gun, you instill responsible behavior, and train folks on both how to use firearms, and how handle them if they need to.\n\nIf you want to instill training, you need to do it early, and often.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1542zv", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7j8odm", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1355951202", "ups": 11, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1542zv", "selftext": "*\"Regulation only affects those who would never break the law to begin with.

(Are you confusing me with the user \"Aethec\" and his claims?)\n\nHowever, because I am genuinely concerned with making sure you understand my claim and find it credible, I am willing to improve my statement by adding a source.   Here is a video of an 11 year old completely field stripping and reassembling an AR-15.  \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irykjLjuKo8\n\nIt is important to note that she is doing much much more than inserting the bolt assembly.   That particular step takes her less than two seconds, and it occurs at this point in time in the video:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=irykjLjuKo8#t=44s\n\nThe item she \"whips\" with her wrist (accompanied by a clicking sound), is the bolt assembly.   This takes place entirely between the 44 second and 47 second time indexes.  The rest of the disassembly/reassembly shown is not required to perform this bolt insertion step, with the exception of pulling the rear detent pin in order to pivot the rifle's upper assembly open.\n\nI bring this up so that folks that may not understand the mechanics of firearms will be better equipped to judge what ramification storing a bolt separately from the firearm really has on the readiness of said firearm.  I will now let you draw your own conclusions on the relevance of bolt storage to the politics of gun ownership.   \n\nI hope you now understand that I was not making things up to try and prove a point.\n\n\n", "edited": 1356299587, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7l6g3e", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1356299018", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c7kztd2", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430754161, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1356301201, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7l66dy", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1356297893", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c7jtm43", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430751069, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I believe the point is moot, anyway.
