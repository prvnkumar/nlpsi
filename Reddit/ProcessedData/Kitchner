If Ireland sent their President however, we would send the Queen (or the royal family in any case). This means there are actually plenty of engagements throughout the year where the Prime Minister would be required instead of the Queen.\n\nWhile it seems you write off a lot of these as \"ceremonial\" duties, they are actually quite important to Britain's diplomacy and other things.

If we replaced the Queen we would either need to transfer those powers to the PM formally, making them extremely powerful, or to someone like an elected President etc. In either case it will fundamentally alter the politics of this country, and not necessarily for the best.\n\nIn relation to the Queens signature not granting authority, I'm afraid you're entirely wrong. The Queen has actually veto'd a bill once in her lifetime and it was a private member's bill (i.e. one with no democratic mandate) that wanted to move the power to declare war from the \"Queen\" (read: the government) to Parliament. If the government had a mandate for that law, she wouldn't have veto'd it, and she basically only did it on the advice of the Prime Minister.\n\nIt's not a convention at all, the monarch's signature is required for a bill to become law. You're right in the sense that if the military and the Police start treating it as law and oppressing anyone who disagrees, then yes it wont apply, but in that scenario we have more to worry about then the legitimacy of the laws they are waving around.\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Zarick452", "id": "t1_cewr8yq", "parent_id": "t1_cesoed3", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1432069006, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Not easy no - all I am saying is that the constitution has to do a series of back flips to maintain the current system, no reason it can;t do back-flips for a different one (aside from the obvious fact that there is only small support for  changing it)\n\nAs you mentioned, most states are divided into the 3 powers of state, legislature, judiciary and executive. Thing is in the UK there isn't a huge amount of distinction between these 3. PM is also de facto leader of legislature due to being leader of the largest party in the house. Why is the sanctity of the separation of the Head of state and head of govt so important when an arguably more important distinction, that between the executive and the legislature, is non-existent in the UK.\n\nI don't disagree that ceremonial duties aren't important, indeed their important to the level that I would only trust them to someone who can be held to account by the people they are supposed to represent.\n\nThanks for highlighting the fact she hasn't signed a bill, genuinelly wasn;t aware of this. Surprised to see it was a bill that sought to take a power from the monarch. Shows there might be a level of self interest there. PM told her not to sign it - doesn't really matter: A bill that got through the elected house was turned down by an unelected monarch doesn't sound like the best defense of the system.\n\nMandate is no source of legitimacy either. look at the current govt, most policies lack a mandate and govts cannot be expected to stick to their manifesto, what with the changing nature of politics. Something that was promised in an election might not actually be plausible, ie  scrapping tuition fee's. Would you suggest the queen not have signed that bill as there was no mandate? \n\nAlso, head of the country is an unelected monarch? embarrassing. UK gave alot of stick t US for president Bush Jr - at least they got the chance to pick him. When The queen dies you've got no other choice than Charles.\n\nAs for other comments.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Statistically there is strong support for the Royal Family in the UK, the highest public opinion polls showed in a long time backing a change was after the death of Diana, where one in four (or one in five) people supported getting rid of the monarchy. 20-25% in favour of their removal was seen as a miniature crisis. \n\nPersonally I am in favour of retaining the monarchy, not for any particularly royalist arguments, simply pragmatic. For me the points in favour are:\n\n* Why change what isn't broken? The royal family currently perform their duties well.\n\n* We would require a head of state, which would mean giving the Prime Minister formal powers which are currently only de facto their to use, or having an elected President which would mean a constitution.\n\n* The royal family and the UK history surrounding them brings in a lot of extra tourist money. Exactly how much they generate is of course debatable, but there are plenty of tourists who come \"to see the Queen\". \n\n* The Queen serves as a final defence against undemocratic legislation (which is ironic when you think about it). If Cameron were to pass a bill granting the Tory party all 600 seats of Parliament, the Queen could oppose it (the only reason the undemocratic Lords can no longer indefinitely delay bills is due to a King agreeing to appoint a load of Lords specifically to pass the bill, think about that)\n\n* The royal family is essentially brought up with a specific purpose which is to represent Britain abroad. If I were to propose we steal 600 children and raise them from birth to be politicians people would think it's unethical. William has known all his life that one day he will be king and has been pretty much groomed to be an excellent diplomat.\n\n* The Royal family own a lot of land in the UK, unless you propose stripping it off them (which some do) or your argue the legality of them \"owning\" it (which some do) then they actually provide more money to the Government then they cost.\n\n* Even if you don't include the revenue above, the Royal family cost a fraction per person of the UK and give us all the benefits included above.\n\nThe arguments against the royal family usually boil down to:\n\n* The rights of man\n\n* They cost too much\n\nThe first argument holds no water with me as our diplomats and civil servants who wield far more power then her Majesty does are not democratically elected either. You could argue they are meritocratically selected, but considering the vast majority of top civil servants are from Oxbridge and not working class backgrounds I'd have to disagree. \n\nIn fact I'd say the Royal Family is more honest about the truths of reality in a way. Only 1 person is born as the next King, you cannot \"become\" King (or at least, not without your own army). On the other hand people are sold the lie that they can make it rich every day, and yet very very few people will ever get from nothing to the 1% of the wealthiest people. Who your parents are is the largest single influence on how your life will unfold, but people often fool themselves into thinking otherwise.\n\nThe second argument I disagree with, as every single republican has always argued that they cost more, but it always relies on not including the Royal Estates, which is land given to the government by the Royal Family in exchange for the royal grant.\n\nAnyone who says it was gave to the government also, for some reason, thinks the fact that it was given to the Government by King George and then Queen Elizabeth had to agree to the same agreement upon sitting on the throne is irrelevant, when actually I think it would show legal precedence that ownership is passed from royal to royal.

If we replaced the Queen we would either need to transfer those powers to the PM formally, making them extremely powerful, or to someone like an elected President etc. In either case it will fundamentally alter the politics of this country, and not necessarily for the best.\n\nIn relation to the Queens signature not granting authority, I'm afraid you're entirely wrong. The Queen has actually veto'd a bill once in her lifetime and it was a private member's bill (i.e. one with no democratic mandate) that wanted to move the power to declare war from the \"Queen\" (read: the government) to Parliament. If the government had a mandate for that law, she wouldn't have veto'd it, and she basically only did it on the advice of the Prime Minister.\n\nIt's not a convention at all, the monarch's signature is required for a bill to become law. You're right in the sense that if the military and the Police start treating it as law and oppressing anyone who disagrees, then yes it wont apply, but in that scenario we have more to worry about then the legitimacy of the laws they are waving around.\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Zarick452", "id": "t1_cewr8yq", "parent_id": "t1_cesoed3", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1432069006, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Not easy no - all I am saying is that the constitution has to do a series of back flips to maintain the current system, no reason it can;t do back-flips for a different one (aside from the obvious fact that there is only small support for  changing it)\n\nAs you mentioned, most states are divided into the 3 powers of state, legislature, judiciary and executive. Thing is in the UK there isn't a huge amount of distinction between these 3. PM is also de facto leader of legislature due to being leader of the largest party in the house. Why is the sanctity of the separation of the Head of state and head of govt so important when an arguably more important distinction, that between the executive and the legislature, is non-existent in the UK.\n\nI don't disagree that ceremonial duties aren't important, indeed their important to the level that I would only trust them to someone who can be held to account by the people they are supposed to represent.\n\nThanks for highlighting the fact she hasn't signed a bill, genuinelly wasn;t aware of this. Surprised to see it was a bill that sought to take a power from the monarch. Shows there might be a level of self interest there. PM told her not to sign it - doesn't really matter: A bill that got through the elected house was turned down by an unelected monarch doesn't sound like the best defense of the system.\n\nMandate is no source of legitimacy either. look at the current govt, most policies lack a mandate and govts cannot be expected to stick to their manifesto, what with the changing nature of politics. Something that was promised in an election might not actually be plausible, ie  scrapping tuition fee's. Would you suggest the queen not have signed that bill as there was no mandate? \n\nAlso, head of the country is an unelected monarch? embarrassing. UK gave alot of stick t US for president Bush Jr - at least they got the chance to pick him. When The queen dies you've got no other choice than Charles.\n\nAs for other comments. I can only agree, British monarch being head of state for other countries is absurd.

In regards to ceremonial duties, the monarch can remain head of the Commonwealth, with the UK simply being an equal member, as well as head of the CofE.

If Cameron were to pass a bill granting the Tory party all 600 seats of Parliament, the Queen could oppose it (the only reason the undemocratic Lords can no longer indefinitely delay bills is due to a King agreeing to appoint a load of Lords specifically to pass the bill, think about that)\n\nThe monarch could similarly make the UK less democratic, if we want to imagine extreme circumstances.

I also think it's a bit sick to revere people without any concern for their accomplishments. Therefore any institution that tries to maintain this reverence and subservience needs to go (especially, given that I don't find any convincing *practical* arguments for the institution's existence). \n\n&gt; The first argument holds no water with me as our diplomats and civil servants who wield far more power then her Majesty does are not democratically elected either. You could argue they are meritocratically selected, but considering the vast majority of top civil servants are from Oxbridge and not working class backgrounds I'd have to disagree.\n\nCivil servants and diplomats are employed to enact the will of a duly elected government. Why on Earth should the ambassador to Sweden be elected? If the man is incompetent at his job, the government will be held accountable for it.

The examples you use do not apply to both systems.\n\nYour first point on \"voting\" by choosing to work for a company or not would never be used in our governmental system. In the private sector, as you say, workers choose a job or choose to change jobs if they are unhappy. This is strictly different from how our government works. Only being able to interact with your government on a meaningful level by leaving is not a meaningful interaction. No one would accept \"just leave your state\" in lieu of a vote.\n\nSimilarly, workers aiming at better jobs is not a system of interaction that would function in government. We actively shun merit based voting rights such as poll taxes or tests. Additionally this seems a very hierarchical structure, with players looking out individually and not as a group. They don't need the support of other workers, just the board or shareholders. We see this with how often CEOs are new hires instead of promoted from within. \n\nSpeaking of stockholders, we don't have our government function this way either. You do not and can not buy shares of votes the way stock holders can. Just because you bought bonds does you won't get more sway or extra votes, because that would undermine the concept of everyone having a say. You would *literally* be buying votes. \n\nLastly, unions on their own accomplished nothing. It required heavy government involvement to accomplish their goals. Strikes can only go so far, and often include the a loss of pay. Additionally, without laws in place workers who are desperate enough to work anyway will take the job (\"scabs\") and the condition never changes. When left to it's own devices, it often [ends poorly](http://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/connections/haymarket/history4.html).

I think the American workforce does carry its values of liberty and equality and democracy into the workplace, and companies do change and respond to employees.\n\nAs laborers, our first and most powerful \"vote\" is the freedom to choose whether to work for a company or not. No one person is forced to work for any one organization, and no one is forced to stay. Culturally, we celebrate songs like \"Take This Job and Shove It.\" In \"Maggie's Farm\" Bob Dylan sings:\n\n&gt;I got a head full of ideas\n&gt;That are drivin' me insane\n&gt;It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor\n&gt;I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.\n\nIn the song, Dylan thinks he knows how to run the farm better than Maggie's autocratic family, and since they won't listen to his ideas, he leaves. Many, many laborers at every level work for change at their jobs. Every day, employees come up with ways to do things differently or better, and you can trust me, as a one-time manager, few people restrain from complaining when they think something is wrong. Management concepts like Kaizen and lean manufacturing that actively seek employee input and innovation, albeit borrowed from the Japanese, have been codified at many US corporations since the 1980s. What's more, tons of people are driven to advance in their careers not only because of the higher pay grade, but *because they think they can do their boss's job better than their boss can.* These are just a few of the ways employees have a say in the direction of a company, and they all come from the idea that no one person necessarily knows better or is better than another. That's an awfully democratic idea.\n\nEven though technically no private enterprise is obligated to respond to employee opinions, they often do. Management tends to keep a finger on the pulse of employees, through annual and quarterly reviews, exit interviews, and turnover rates. I can't think of a corporation that doesn't have a Human Resources department to handle employee concerns, whose mission is to attract and retain employees, and whose head is usually C-suite. These controls aren't in place to be nice, generally, or from a place of social justice, but because finding and training quality employees is expensive. So through market forces, corporations take employee wants and needs into consideration. (You can add to this the notion that higher employee morale = better productivity, though personally I've found that to be mostly lip service, and the days of skateboarding through the office at Yahoo are pretty much over.)\n\nAll this leaves aside labor unions, which are as American as apple pie. In many sectors, they're still a big player when it comes to employee representation. It's kind of ironic: the workplace safety laws and measures you mentioned imposed by the government were driven by unions, and their consequent adoption has probably been the biggest reason unions have diminutive power these days.\n\nNow, do employees get to approve next year's capital budget? Of course not; But at the same time, voters didn't get to decide whether or not we'd shoot missiles at Syria last year. All we could do is make a bunch of noise and question whether or not it was a good idea. But leaving these types of decisions to others is more a function of the division of labor than it is an insult to democracy. You can't ask voters for a referendum on every decision, because it's not efficient and because not everyone has the information or the background to make the call, and you can't ask assembly line employees at what price you should value your competitor's shares in the buyout for the very same reason. But if any one employee has misgivings about the way the company is being run, she can sure as shit leave, or work her way closer to being the one that makes the call.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ces8ekr", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1389996352", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "HalfoffSale", "id": "t1_ceryyl1", "parent_id": "t1_cervj13", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431984130, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Cynicism aside, it's different structurally.

If McDoanlds offered me \u00a312,000 a year and as a results the government only paid me \u00a38,000 so I earned \u00a320,000 total I'd actually be earning more then I do in my current job (but not by much).\n\nOn the other hand though I enjoy my current job more then working at McDoanlds (plus I'd be earning more anyway as I'd probably get my wage topped up too).\n\nIf I was unemployed though had the choice though between working a shit job for an extra 5 grand a year (or less then \u00a3500 extra per month BEFORE tax), would I do it? I don't know, probably not though. Which means McDoanlds would have to pay their staff more (or make their work environment better).\n\nThe whole point of this system isn't to make \"the shittiest job\" enough to live off because then you just get a load of poor people stuck in \"the shittiest jobs\" because they need to live.\n\nHowever, if you make *no job* enough to live off then companies need to offer you an actual incentive to turn up and work, whether it is money or good working conditions. \n\n", "id": "t1_ce32uuo", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Kitchner", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1sz3yy", "selftext": "&gt;No because you just make it so working always makes you better off then not working, for example:\n&gt;Earn 0 - 3,999 = paid 20,000 = Total salary of 20,000-23,999\n\nAsk yourself this, would you go from not working at all, to working a 35 hour week (involving a hour long drive to work and back maybe) for an extra $4000 in your pocket per year?\n\nAnyway, what you are talking about is a top up. Perhaps if you were only eligible for the top up if you work.. ok. But then this just becomes a tax break for corporations to pay workers fuck all. They'll know that they can cut worker wages and it's ok because the workers will hardly notice the difference and the taxpayer will pick up the tab.\n\nIt's not about always earning more when you're in work, because that's pretty much how it is already. What needs to be true is that you are *way* better off in work, not just a little bit better off. But when you are out of work, the safety net exists that you can still use to live off.\n\nPerhaps if job seekers was means tested to tax recently paid. I've paid tens of thousands of pounds in taxes over the last couple of years. If anyone should be entitled to a buoyant safety net in the event of losing my job, it's me. People who have never worked, not so much.\n\n&gt;McDonalds would have to pay more than they do now to get staff.\n\nWhy? because people would chose to not work instead? unless of course you're only getting the top up if you work - but then we're back to square 1.\n\nThe problem of our time is low wages. The government isn't there to top up wages with taxes paid for by tax on the same wages they are topping up.\n\nIf the minimum wage was brought to a level that an individual could rent a shitty apartment and buy enough food and transport to live off (which would be considerably higher than it is now) then Macdonalds would be forced to pay people more money by law. By extension though, engineers will start commanding more money because what's to stop them walking out of their high stress job into a a fast food joint and earning 80% the wage they used to earn?\n\nAll this extra wage in the hands of Joe public means public spending increases and the opposition noise yelling of companies going bust because they can't afford to pay their employees will be drowned out by the sound of till checkouts ringing off the hook.", "id": "t1_ce34fyj", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "MrPoletski", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_ce32uuo", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428108348, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ce34fyj", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1387214875", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_ce3005h", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428109089, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ce32uuo", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1387210964", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_ce2z5gg", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428110494, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ce3005h", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1387201579", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_ce2xpv2", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428110957, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1sz3yy", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ce2z5gg", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1387197354", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}

If nothing else, in this type of environment, political science prepares you to think about the world in terms of conflict, limited resources, and alliance-building.\n\n&gt; Lets use an example. Someone's interested in transportation policy. Maybe at US (or a state's) DOT. Maybe for House T&amp;I, or Senate Commerce.\nWhat do you think makes them more marketable to their prospective employer? Having a substantive degree (transportation engineering, civil engineering, whatever)? Or having a poli sci degree?\n\nI would hope in this case, the applicant with the engineering degree would get the job, since a political scientist wouldn't be prepared to handle the day-to-day tasks of, say, overseeing adoption of new highway safety regulations, or something. But if the job-opening was at a policy think tank for the position of a policy analyst, I don't think the engineer would be in such a comfortable position as the political scientist.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1rf3vz", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdnlvni", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1385495414", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdncprb", "score": -1, "retrieved_on": 1428499283, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdniub9", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1385488665", "ups": -1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdmubs3", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428502215, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1rf3vz", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdncprb", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1385471140", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Apart from you wont do that, because that is not what businesses do.\n\nThe only reason you'd try to net a competitive advantage over McDonalds is if you thought it was sustainable. \n\nBoth your examples are pretty bad as /u/justsomecollegeguy implies McDonalds makes 0 profit off the burger. \n\nInstead it would be more accurate to say this:\n\nMcDonalds pays 10cents for the burger, 40 cents to staff and sell said burger for $1 and nets 50 cents profit. \n\nAccording to The Internet\u2122 McDonalds sells 2,365,200,000 burgers a year. Let's say our hypothetical McDonalds sells 2,000,000,000 a year netting them a turnover of $1,000,000,000 (on just the burgers, lets assume they only sell burgers!).\n\nIf you're saying Burger King also pays 50 cents a burger in terms of cost to buy and wages, and makes the same profit, let's assume Burger King also sells 2 billion burgers a year and makes 1 billion a year turnover.\n\nNow I'm the government and I have put a 10 cent burger tax on burgers. McDonalds have a choice of either reducing their margin by 10 cents a burger (costing the company $200,000,000) or you can pass on the cost to the consumer (costing them nothing).\n\nLet's assume McDoanlds passes on the cost. Now you as Burger King have two options:\n\n1) Copy McDonalds and pass on the cost (costing you nothing)\n2) Offer a lower price then McDonalds (costing you any where between $20,000,000 and $200,000,000 in your margins)\n\nNow your argument is you pick option 2 and charge $1.01 for a burger and laugh all the way to the bank as your extra customers will pay for the reduced margin. In order for you to do that, you'd have to sell and extra 352,941,177 burgers, or about 17.6% of McDonald's market share.\n\nLet me just say at this point, stealing 17.6% of another company's market share based on a 9 cent difference is pretty difficult.\n\nNow here's the biggest flaw in your logic. You know McDonalds has the same operating costs as you do, so if you DO manage to steal 17.6% of their market share, they can just drop their price to match yours and bring it back. Suddenly you've managed to destroy nearly $400,000,000 worth of value across the entire market.\n\nYou know from the start that you can't sustain your competitive advantage as McDoanlds will just copy you to avoid losing their market share, and then you both lose out.\n\nSo unless you know you can out price McDonalds no matter what, there is no long term benefit to reducing your price. Therefore you'll just increase your cost the same as McDoanlds, and consumers wont have a choice, you'll increase your profits and the government gets more tax money.\n\nThe only time you see companies competing on price is if they can gaurentee that they can out price and subsequently outlast their competition at a rock bottom price. \n\nIt is not in a company's interest to directly compete on price, it never is unless they know they have the lowest costs. Taxes on corporations are nearly always passed onto the consumer, and then eloquently avoided paying through tax loopholes anyway (it's in the news there is a 10p burger tax, so you put prices up by 10p, then use your accounts to only pay 5p of the 10p tax anyway, thus bagging a profit). Why did you think that big companies like Wal-Mart and McDonalds aren't constantly cutting their prices? *New entrants* compete on price because they have nothing to lose by devaluing the market.\n\nThat's not to say they don't have their uses though, in some cases you want them to pass cost onto the consumer in order to discourage consumers from buying the product in the first place (e.g. cigarettes) and other times it's simply the best political course of action to raise more tax money or take a stance on a particular issue. \n\n\n", "id": "t1_cdbouvy", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Kitchner", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cdbfqli", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428705786, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1qc72o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdbouvy", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384172575", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}

Realism isn't some monolithic beast that only cares for material power (even if people like Waltz, Mearsheimer, Rose would have it that way). This comes down to the non-material forms of power that the United States draws from to supplement material powers (the nukes, the carriers etc).

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Given large countries don't have as big an influence as they once did, does this put the smaller countries at an advantage?\n\nDefinitely.\n\nFor example if you look at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) that is arguably the strongest Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) in the world. It can levy massive tariffs against a country's imports if they feel someone has broke the WTO agreements. \n\nNeed an example? The US, arguably still the most powerful singular country in the world, had to back down from placing tariffs on steel imports (intended to protect the failing US steel industry) by France taking the case to the WTO. If they didn't they could have effectively be fined \u00a31.3 billion in terms of extra charges on US steel exports to other countries.\n\nAs the world becomes more and more globalised as lot of academics predict you'll see a lot more supranational organisation like the EU. Poland doesn't have economic or military power, but it does have a vote in the EU and in some cases even a veto. \n\nThrough international law and organisations smaller countries are becoming more influential and larger ones are finding their power diminishing.\n\nWhen you ask me \"Which countries have a nice balance [of sorting their own problems vs other people's]?\" the answer is entirely dependent on your point of view!\n\nI mean western countries generally have all sorts of problems, but realistically the poorest in the UK, US, Europe etc live like a king compared to even the \"standard\" lifestyles of many countries. So at what point do you say you have your own ship in order to fix other people's problems? (Assuming they even want your help!).\n\nSmaller european countries tend to have less influence in the world then say countries like the US and UK, but also even less then places like India, Australia, Canada.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I think your question is really \"Why do political leaders feel the need to convey how important and powerful their country is?\"\n\nSo there are a whole range of reasons to do so, but really the country it is has a massive influence on what those pros and cons are.\n\nFor example during the Cold War posturing was necessary from both the US and USSR in order to try and \"beat\" the other one, convince allies to join them as they could protect them etc etc.\n\nWhen a country has the power to actually influence events around them, whether they be global or regional, appearing powerful is necessary. No one country  on the planet, not even America, holds the power to force other countries to do what they want anymore, so instead you need to remind people how difficult you could make their lives if you wanted to.\n\nThe last time this happened that relates to the UK was probably the Suez Crisis, where Britain ignored the American government and the US government promptly responding by crashing the UK economy pretty much overnight. \n\nNow the US could theoretically fuck with people economically if it wanted to, but both justifying that action and following through with it are much harder then they were 50 years ago.\n\nIf you're a small country or one that has no power in the events you are trying to influence, there's no point in trying to look powerful; no-one will listen no matter what you say. However, countries still posture. The reason for this of course is the intended audience.\n\nRelating it to the UK again, you're probably referring to Cameron's alleged \"defence\" of the UK when a \"Russian Official\", which no-one has been able to name or pinpoint, said Britain was a \"small island\" and that no-one cared what we thought.\n\nNow, conspiracy theories aside about whether or not it was ever said, who actually cares what a russian official who isn't even senior enough to be well known by the media says? Just as if a random US official said \"Syria's/Iran's/North Korea's opinion is irrelevant on the world stage\" it's not going to *change* anything.\n\nOn the other hand could you imagine the press if Cameron had said nothing? \"Russia slights UK, Cameron does nothing\" etc etc. \n\nSo often countries without power \"talk big\" to tell *their own citizens* about how big they are talking and how powerful their country is. \n\nIf you needed to break it specifically into pros and cons, you can see some of the pros above, but there aren't really any inherent cons to \"talking up your country\". \n\nThe only downside is people may look to you for help which you cannot provide either for international or political reasons at home. This has happened to the US numerous times. Realistically though from the point of national interest, there is are dire consequences of this.

It can levy massive tariffs against a country's imports if they feel someone has broke the WTO agreements. \n\nNeed an example? The US, arguably still the most powerful singular country in the world, had to back down from placing tariffs on steel imports (intended to protect the failing US steel industry) by France taking the case to the WTO. If they didn't they could have effectively be fined \u00a31.3 billion in terms of extra charges on US steel exports to other countries.\n\nAs the world becomes more and more globalised as lot of academics predict you'll see a lot more supranational organisation like the EU. Poland doesn't have economic or military power, but it does have a vote in the EU and in some cases even a veto. \n\nThrough international law and organisations smaller countries are becoming more influential and larger ones are finding their power diminishing.\n\nWhen you ask me \"Which countries have a nice balance [of sorting their own problems vs other people's]?\" the answer is entirely dependent on your point of view!\n\nI mean western countries generally have all sorts of problems, but realistically the poorest in the UK, US, Europe etc live like a king compared to even the \"standard\" lifestyles of many countries. So at what point do you say you have your own ship in order to fix other people's problems? (Assuming they even want your help!).\n\nSmaller european countries tend to have less influence in the world then say countries like the US and UK, but also even less then places like India, Australia, Canada.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "This is a pretty good answer in regards to the immigration factor, however it is very one dimensional to say it is purely to do with immigration. There have been \"waves\" of immigration into Europe for the last 100 years, and yet the far right has \"risen\" only twice; once before WW2 and, you could argue, now. \n\nSo therefore it is useful to also highlight that the rise of the far right can also be linked to: \n\n1) The increasing integration of the EU; \n\n2) Economics; and \n\n3) Political systems.\n\nPersonally I think point 3 really needs to be mentioned.\n\nThe reason it is linked to the first one is because whenever there is change there is always a counter movement. The EU is eroding the national sovereignty of the member states (for better or for worse) and a lot of the right wing movements are very nationalistic. The BNP in the UK for example talks about how great Britain is and how we shouldn't get told what to do by other countries.\n\nThe reason the second point is important is because in times of crisis people turn away from the establishment and turn towards the extremes. In the run up to Hitler's role as Chancellor before WW2 both the communist AND the right wing parties saw an increase in votes gained. When your current leaders (and by leaders I mean the established parties) all fail to provide solutions to the problems facing your country (even if it's because realistically the problem is out of everyone's control) people turn to those providing alternative answers. For example Hitler actually put forward a lot of very radical economic policies, very *socialist* economic policies to guarantee every German a job. \n\nFinally it relates to the political system. Europe is the largest concentration of proportional representation democracies in the world. Nearly every country outside of the UK in Europe has a democratic system that is inclined to produce coalition governments and parliaments made of multiple, small parties (and even the UK ended up with a coalition in 2010!). These proportional systems benefit small parties greatly and allow them to get a \"foot in the door\" as it were. Once you have a party physically in the system it legitimises them. In France their extreme right party (trans. as The National Front) literally almost won the presidency, has MEPs and controls regional councils in France. The Greek extreme party (Golden Dawn) as MP equivalents in Greek parliament. This lends legitimacy to these parties and gives them a platform to spread their message.\n\nIndividually none of these things can cause a \"rise\" in extreme politics. The systems never really showed signs of a rise before, there have been economic recession in the past without a rise, and moves to integrate the EU didn't result in a big rise.\n\nHowever when you combine my three points with the commenter above you get:\n\n* Increased immigration creating social unease and providing a handy scapegoat for those wishing to blame their troubles somewhere;\n* Step by step progress towards integration of the EU, with more decisions being taken away from countries. \n* Especially economically at the moment;\n* Economic problems that are out of the control of normal politicians, and people looking for a way to fix this; and\nPolitical systems designed to give voice to smaller parties with minority opinions. \n\nThe combination of all four is why you have a rise of the right wing extremists. They propose radical solutions to fix the current economic problems, blaming immigration and loss of national sovereignty (and pride!) on their recent woes. They are able to do this because they just need to win a few relatively small victories to get a platform, and can then build up momentum.

The only other answer that is likely is that the OP is British as we Brits don't like to think of us as \"European\". In either case both countries use a FPTP system rather then proportional ones.\n\nThe countries where you have seen a prominent rise in the right are countries with systems that benefit smaller parties more, namely proportional representation systems, which in turn benefit coalition governments.\n\nWhether or not you feel coalition governments are effective or not is a matter of debate. I've seen studies and papers showing that they are both more effective and less effective then \"strong\" single party governments. If you believe they are less effective it adds another cause to the rise (weak government, weak solutions. People get sick of them) or it doesn't.\n\nSo if you exclude that, the point isn't that coalition governments = rising right wing parties, it's that systems that *tend towards* coalition governments usually provide a platform to smaller parties to get their message across in a legitimised fashion.\n\nAgain, the point wasn't that the system in of itself leads to the rise of the right, but in combination with the others helps enable it. If it wasn't for Britain's FPTP system for example I'm sure that UKIP and even the BNP would have had at least 1 MP by now.

The reason is that you only need a certain percent of total votes to get mandate in office (though method of government can differ conutry to country).

However social issues would have been masked by the inherent racism in British society, after all how do you distinguish racism caused by social friction from \"general\" racism?\n\nThe next big wave of immigration was in the 80s and this was largely former colonies again, however before it was primarily west Indies, jamacian etc this time there was a mix if Indian and Pakistani thrown I to the mix too.

You have seen the rise of organisations like the EDL who claim Muslims will overthrow the UK etc.\n\nNow/next will be the continuation or possible increase of immigration from eastern Europe, which is possible due to EU rules. You have seen the rise of UKIP and other right wing parties have taken a very anti-EU posture.\n\nThe fact is any country that attempts to integrate individuals of radically different cultures in what is quite frankly an astonishingly short space of time will face pressures. The 'home' citizens feel they are competing for state resources with people who haven't been here as long so therefore aren't as deserving and the 'new' citizens (usually 2nd generation mind you) try to retain the parts of their culture that make them different. \n\nThe reason the right is on the rise in Europe is the factor of all the combinations above, immigration alone will not prompt it.

The population is becoming extremely top heavy with at least 30% of the population over the age of retirement. The burden comes from the fact the UK hasn't expanded it's infrastructure to cope with approx. an extra 10million people over the last ten years. It doesn't matter if it was a baby boom or immigration. \n\nAlso it's worth noting even if the actual competition isn't there, it's the perception of competition that matters.\n\nAs for the culture thing, everyone has a point where they wouldnt accept someone else forcing their culture onto you. For example, implementing sharia law in the UK or even allowing others to be governed by it outside of the normal legal process would be unacceptable to me. Now, I consider myself quite a multicultural person, but saying I don't want others to be governed by a separate legal system, even if it's their culture, does that make me racist? \n\nMost would say not, some would say it does. The majority will always feel threatened by a strong minority, either strong because of numbers or strong due to cultural differences.\n\nThe Welsh were brutally oppressed by the English due to the fact they spoke another language hundreds of years ago for example, despite Wales being tiny compared to England's size and strength. In northern Ireland there is/was violence against Catholics from protestants and vice versa, yet in the republic there wasn't. Why? There is roughly a 60/40 split of protestants to Catholics in the north but only like a 95/5 split of protestants to Catholics in the south.\n\nLikewise humans are naturally racist. The human brain puts people in boxes as an evolutionary method of survival. Not ALL bears are dangerous, but MOST are etc. Everyone in the UK has an idea of what bring \"British\" is and people who don't fit I to their \"box\" are different, and therefore difficult to understand and, thus, a potential threat.\n\nLabelling people who feel uneasy about a strong culturally different minority in their country as \"racist\" fuels the fire of actual racists who hate based on skin colour etc alone.\n\nIt's very difficult to tell the difference in the current climate, as often those who fall for the right wing narrative are undereducated, so would have difficulty articulating or understanding the wider issues if you engage them in debate. \n\nIt is perfectly natural to see unease though.
