There is business incorporation, which, depending on the state in which it forms, has various tax benefits and liability protections. Then there is municipal incorporation, which is when a state grants a certain area the right to govern itself according to state laws. New York City, for example, has elections for mayor and a city council which passes local laws that only apply in the city and do not violate existing state law. \n\nAs far as incorporated businesses are concerned, there are a few advantages and disadvantages to forming one. First, its very easy to raise capital (money) for a corporation. They can issue stock or bonds that can be bought by the public at large or only offered to select people (closed corporation, usually small companies). Second, the owners (any person who has one or more shares of outstanding stock), have limited liability for the debts incurred by the business. If you buy stock in, say, X-acto corp, then you are one of the onwers (there can be hundreds of thousands of owners!). Now let's say they build a $100 million X-acto factory, and they borrow the money from the bank to get it done. So, you are currently an owner of a company that owes the bank big money. If the business tanks (somebody invents a better process for X-actoing) before the debt is repaid, nobody from the bank is going to come knocking on your door looking for money. Your liability is limited to the amount you invest in the company. If you only bought $50 worth of shares, then that is the maximum amount of money you can lose. \n\nAs far as voting goes, every shareholder has one vote per share they control in a corporation. Usually this is used to elect new board members (high level executives) who run the company on behalf of the owners - the shareholders (that's you!).", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1pba8c", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd0mpom", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1382886139", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1pba8c", "id": "t1_cd0n76t", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "weetbix-kid", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1pba8c", "selftext": "The reason for privatization is globalization.

Earlier campaign finance reform had stipulated that such ads couldn't be aired within so many days before a campaign. A case that came later that year in the US Circuit Court for DC (*SpeechNow.org v. FEC*) ruled that it was unconstitutional to limit the amount that such organizations could receive in donations. Essentially, these cases together said that organizations (unions, non-profits, corporations) could not be barred in spending money on political activities **so long as said organizations had no entanglement with a campaign or candidate**. Though these rulings affected what is known in political science as *soft money* (money donated to organizations other than directly to a candidate or his/her campaign), it didn't really affect *hard money* (money given directly to a candidate). There are still limits on how much businesses and individuals can give to a candidate directly. \n\nSheol brings up great points, but the constitutionality of campaign finance doesn't really relate to the type of donation that you are talking about. I think more so it wouldn't really make sense to ban donations because of his second point, as Congress members talking about job creation are 99% of the time doing such for political purposes. While it is true that they can pass legislation that could catalyze job growth potentially, they aren't directly creating jobs at all. Rather, mostly small businesses are the ones that create jobs. Whenever you hear a pol talk about job creation or really anything in general it is usually all for politics (and essentially a ploy to get more donations/supporters and win reelection). For example, look at President Obama. While he talks a ton about job creation, it is mostly because that is part of his job: to direct the Congress to pass legislation that will possibly help small businesses (or corporations) hire more people. This doesn't mean that jobs will be created by the politicians.

Earlier campaign finance reform had stipulated that such ads couldn't be aired within so many days before a campaign. A case that came later that year in the US Circuit Court for DC (*SpeechNow.org v. FEC*) ruled that it was unconstitutional to limit the amount that such organizations could receive in donations. Essentially, these cases together said that organizations (unions, non-profits, corporations) could not be barred in spending money on political activities **so long as said organizations had no entanglement with a campaign or candidate**. Though these rulings affected what is known in political science as *soft money* (money donated to organizations other than directly to a candidate or his/her campaign), it didn't really affect *hard money* (money given directly to a candidate). There are still limits on how much businesses and individuals can give to a candidate directly. \n\nSheol brings up great points, but the constitutionality of campaign finance doesn't really relate to the type of donation that you are talking about. I think more so it wouldn't really make sense to ban donations because of his second point, as Congress members talking about job creation are 99% of the time doing such for political purposes. While it is true that they can pass legislation that could catalyze job growth potentially, they aren't directly creating jobs at all. Rather, mostly small businesses are the ones that create jobs. Whenever you hear a pol talk about job creation or really anything in general it is usually all for politics (and essentially a ploy to get more donations/supporters and win reelection). For example, look at President Obama. While he talks a ton about job creation, it is mostly because that is part of his job: to direct the Congress to pass legislation that will possibly help small businesses (or corporations) hire more people. This doesn't mean that jobs will be created by the politicians.

We examine earnings mobility among pairs of fathers and sons as well as fathers and daughters using both mobility matrices and regression and correlation coefficients. Our results suggest that all countries exhibit substantial earnings persistence across generations, but with statistically significant differences across countries. Mobility is lower in the U.S. than in the U.K., where it is lower again compared to the Nordic countries. Persistence is greatest in the tails of the distributions and tends to be particularly high in the upper tails: though in the U.S. this is reversed with a particularly high likelihood that sons of the poorest fathers will remain in the lowest earnings quintile. This is a challenge to the popular notion of 'American exceptionalism'. The U.S. also differs from the Nordic countries in its very low likelihood that sons of the highest earners will show downward 'long-distance' mobility into the lowest earnings quintile. In this, the U.K. is more similar to the U.S..\n\nDownload Info\n\nFile URL: http://ftp.iza.org/dp1938.pdf", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "id": "t1_c8rtyhl", "parent_id": "t3_19vm2o", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1431518733, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8rtyhl", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1362715975", "distinguished": null, "ups": 3}

If a company wants to enjoy all the benefits of being based in America then our labor laws should apply to wherever they employ people. It is morally irresponsible to say that slave labor is illegal for our own citizens but just fine for everyone else. This would bring manufacturing jobs and all other oft outsourced work back to America OR it could possibly cause a lot of businesses to flee America and make their base of operations elsewhere. If the latter were the case I think they would find that success is not as easy without the generous support of the American government and the huge market of the American people and ultimately they would choose to return or fail (of course some would still succeed, possibly a fair number, but that would cause similar labor revolutions in those countries as America in the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries).\n\nTo preserve the market of America we would also have to begin taxing imported goods a sufficient rate to discourage the kind of flight of business that I just mentioned. Why would we want them to prosper enormously on the backs of slaves and then charge a huge mark-up in the states for those products? We need to generate our own economy to a certain degree and if we are the ones buying the stuff we should try and make us the ones that are making those things or have a sort of equitable trade of exports with other countries that is mutually beneficial. Again, if we believe that C and Y has to be the law in America then we should not be allowing trade with business that ignores these rules, it is a pretty clear-cut moral imperative. \n\nNest, in a similar vein, we have to begin fining companies for their misconduct at a sufficient rate so that it is not financially possible for them to break the rules, pay the fine, still make a shitload of profit, and pass on all the costs of their blunder to the taxpayers. This would be for things like pollution and whatnot. As it stands the fines for massive toxic dumpings and other similar egregious errors of judgement are a pittance in compared to what it would actually cost to dispose of this waste responsibly and effectively, this cost is then passed on to the taxpayers when the government has to clean it up or onto the people as China is seeing with their unbreathable air and undrinkable water.\n\nThis same policy also would have prevented the current banking scandal in which we simply bailed out the banks rather than, as a an option in the bailout bill allowed for and what the US has forced other countries to do when we have intervened in their banking scandals, to have the government take over the banks and run them until they are profitable again at which point the shares would be sold off back to private investors and the taxpayers would get a small and reasonable return on their investment that would act as interest on the bailout loan. \n\nThis also means simply no more of these bullshit tax loopholes. I can't understand how anyone is not outraged by this. In tons of cases the government and taxpayers are literally paying huge corporations for the privilege of being fucked by them. If you run a business, if you earn money, and use public services then you pay taxes to support that system. It is literally that simple. Some of these loopholes are simply legalese bullshit and others are there for a reason and we know why they are there and how they are supposed to be used. If a giant corporations bookkeepers can find and exploit these loopholes the government should also be able to find them and close them up or deny the flagrant use of them for other than their intended design.\n\nFinally (not necessarily the last thing but I don't know how much more I can actually type with becoming exhausted or aggravated right now) we actually need to begin investing in the people of this country again. This means putting a focus on free, equitable, and quality education all the way through college. The more educated and skilled our populace the healthier the economy on the whole is. This would also mean better public services, chiefly of which would be universal healthcare [(I just went on a tear about this in another thread)](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/18uua0/americans_of_reddit_if_sacrificing_your_defense/c8i6t5t?context=3) which would serve to lessen personal debt among our citizens, encourage a healthier population, and overall cost the government a great deal less.\n\nOther 'entitlement' programs (the quotes are derisive, these are programs meant to help those who need help. Of course they will be abused but it is our duty to help those who need it and that means a few bad eggs are going to bilk the system - though that money would be a pittance in comparison to what giant corporations bilk from us currently) need to be re-imagined, retooled, made more effective and comprehensive, and all around better. Though that is a whole other discussion about how to make that happen.\n\nI probably just came off as a blow-hard, narcissist, know-it-all but I ruminate on these issues quite often and will take any opportunity I have to try and explicate them and tout the good that could come of actually realizing the real American Dream where everyone actually does have the ability to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and make a better life for themselves and their families. Every man, woman, and child should be ashamed at the state of moral repugnance this country has gotten to thanks to the fake design of 'capitalism' and 'free-market' that conservatives have created over the past 100 years. Yes, what I am talking about is not an absolutely free market, it is a controlled free market and this is the only way to actually create an equitable system and more importantly the only way to scrupulously run a country. A truly free market is every third-world country in the world where drug kingpins, warlords, and tyrants rule at the cost of the health, happiness, and lives of the people they are exploiting. That is free-market and I will not stand for the kind of freedom that allows children to starve and women to be raped for the greed of despicable human beings.      \n\nSorry about the rant, I am sure I said way more than you wish to read.

America's shrinking middle-class is largely due to both the export of labor and the mechanization of labor. Anyone used to be able to be trained for manufacturing jobs and because these jobs required some know-how but were relatively trainable positions both employee and employer were likely to work with each other's interests in mind thus creating a network of livable wage jobs for people without specific and rare marketable skills.\n\nWe are going to start seeing more and more of this as time progresses and as the world population grows the problem wil;l be exacerbated to the nth degree. It is a scary future for the lower-class, if something doesn't change it is going to become nearly impossible for them to ever claw their way out of the bottom of the barrel no matter how capable. \n\nIt is possible that programming could become the new equivalent to manufacturing though. There is more and more of a demand for capable and innovative programmers who are up-to-date with all the software and hardware that exists right now and we are seeing these people coming not from schools or universities but from their parent's basements. As long as computer hardware remains at the relatively affordable rate it has been becoming anyone who can afford a cheap crappy PC has the ability to learn to upgrade that machine at cost through using it and grow their skills from there own their own terms and schedule.\n\nYou are absolutely correct though, the number of jobs is shrinking due to increased industrialization and mechanization that humans can't compare to in speeds or even sometimes quality and accuracy. There will also always be positions hor artisans who specialize in handmade goods in certain areas though because until 3D printing technology makes a huge, enormous leap some things aren't cheap to automate simply because each single item needs to be (or would be better if it were) catered to the customer. A really good cobbler or tailor can always find work and so can a contractor and various other postions like these.\n\nWe are moving to a world of more hyper-specific professions that people will have to decide on earlier and dedicate more time to in order to be worth more than a machine that can output with uniformity at great speeds.\n\nGood points.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18uegs", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8i5awg", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361320830", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c8i3gdv", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431345021, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1361320405, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18uegs", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8i505k", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361319906", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

The real danger *as well as beauty* I think for humanity is the fact that in the final analysis these things are at their core, tools, but incredibly sophisticated ones. They can make some parts of the work much easier, for example, filling in the tedious details while the architect directs the process.. \n\nBut, I would be lying if I did not admit that there is a very real process of devaluation of any static skill over time.. The bar is continually rising, very quickly and anybody who stats still for too long risks being put out of the game so to speak..\n\nHowever, all the architects that I know are really passionate about computers and computing..\n\nOf course all engineers are familiar with various kinds of CAD software some of it quite sophisticated.. Another huge area is computer visualization, an area I have always been interested in.\n\nTechnology's huge gift to creative folk is tempered by the fact that it democratizes the arts by making the cost of entry much lower.. \n\nEverybody isn't an architect, but software makes it much easier to be a amateur and a good one.\n\nAnyway, here I find myself with the opportunity to write something very - how can I put it, multifacteted about technology. But I'm sleepy and I'm just not up to it as I would like to be..\n\nWe should not fear technology - Technology could transform our society in very good ways..\n\nBut, then i think of my architect friend C. who cant get work doing architecture (which she loves) because there simply isn't much of a demand for it unless you're well known, however for years she was paying her rent doing Autocad for other architects.. But last i spoke with her she was getting disgusted with that because she says that the clients she has recently got dont care about quality and are nickel and diming her on her rates.. Lots of people know Autocad now, and she feels, not many clients really appreciate quality. I don't know how it is now, it might be better, that was a few years ago..\n\nPro photographers bitch about digital photography a lot (even as they use it all the time)\n\nBut, I guess architecture is a good example of an area where practitioners have to keep moving or their skills become worth less and less by staying in the same place... All technical skillsets are like that.\n\nThe gradual evolution of parametrically driven software that can take a set of design specifications and work with it to output a completed building plan and bill of materials as well as sequential instructions for its assembly could be a boon or a threat, it will effect the entire spread of a field from top to bottom... \n\nThis area a very very interesting one and of course it is and will be and will eternally be solved over and over in very interesting ways. One of the most interesting I think is generative art..\n\nMy first exposure to generative art was when I quite young  when I first heard brian eno's music for airports.. which is rules based generative music..  \n\nPeople rarely realize this but computers only with much coaxing can produce anything truly random..\n\nBut generative art requires a random seed.. entropy..\n\ntypically a \"seed\" is used that is used to make a series of art pieces that are generated randomly and the user selects the subset of the generated pieces that appeal to the user for any reason whatsoever, then the computer generates another set more like the ones picked, each successive iteration in theory the output will be closer to the unverbalized desires of the user. In a sense its a bit like a random toss of the dice but this technique can be quite well developed and ultimately it is a very productive space - the artist and the machine working together to create originality. Ive actually done works of \"architecture\" using generative art using programs that I have which produce 3D \"minimal surfaces\" and then mapping the 3D shapes produced into imaginary buildings. I would have to dig through my old stuff to find them but they were quite beautiful!\n\nActually, the world of mathematics has a great many shapes which can be translated into architectural structures that have enormous appeal for many reasons. One of my favorites is the [tensegrity mast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kenneth_Snelson_Needle_Tower.JPG) which is a very strong structure that can be erected vertically with very little in the way of equipment. (pipes and cable) \n\nI suspect that its not as difficult as it sounds to write a piece of software that lets you say- design software to generate plans for a building that say, always can withstand  wind of x, and support y kilos, contains a mens room and a ladies room, always contains electrical outlets at x number of feet apart, always includes some minimum of windows in a room, except for a closet, and so on.\n\nI use software to create PC boards that has similar kinds of processes going on. There isn't much of  difference in certain ways between an architecture program and a PCB design that creates a multitude of different kinds of files which can be sent to a PC board fab that tell them what to put on each side of the boards, where to drill the vias, auto routes traces, and so on.\n\nI'll answer the others a bit later when I have more time.", "id": "t1_c8fa3lv", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "But architecture is as much about aesthetics as it is about functionality, and that's where a computer program would fall short.

Because the United States must provide compensation under WTO rules \nbefore removing U.S. health care policy from WTO jurisdiction, quick action to do so will be \nmuch less costly, before more foreign insurance and health care providers enter the U.S. market. \"\n\nNow Google Antigua WTO \"online gambling\" GATS\n\n\n", "id": "t1_c8d171c", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c8d0u3d", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431255799, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1360555657, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1809t9", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8d171c", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1360555026", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c8czimf", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431255654, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1809t9", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8d0u3d", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1360553925", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c8czbcj", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431255011, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1809t9", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8czimf", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1360549979", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I think the rich people pretend to be unaware for reasons such as plausible deniability.. \n\nI have read some interesting thoughts on that in literature identified as \"situationism\"", "id": "t1_c8czlby", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c8czbcj", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431255043, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1809t9", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8czlby", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1360550214", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c8cqlod", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431254915, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8czbcj", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1360549341", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c8an1ce", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431250745, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1809t9", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8cqlod", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1360520404", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

You can't have it both ways.\n\nA tax on consumption naturally discourages it, but there are two other factors brought in.  One, there is more income for someone to consume with (no more income taxes, plus the prebate) and the suppliers of those items also no longer have taxes, so prices will go down.  IIRC, they picked their rate as it was the average tax rate baked into the cost of things.\n\nIn the end, you end up with prices stabilizing back to where they were (or less or more, depending on the item) but each item will still have its own demand price inelasticity - iPhones, for example, might not be impacted by a higher price, but cans of tomato sauce might be.\n\nConsumption is a large part of our economy, but many economists argue that we consume too much and save far too little.  Because we save too little, when there is a shock to a person, we typically rely upon debt to bridge that gap.  Debt incurs interest, which is essentially stealing from the future consumption for today (less money to spend in the future).  Savings is the opposite of that - you bypass consumption today for the future.  Savings is seen as a benefit because it leads to stability... not to mention the ability for people to consume things they ordinarily wouldn't be able to (not consuming 1 Big Mac each day allows someone to go and consume a 5-star dinner if they wait long enough).\n\nDoes that make sense?

[Republican Legislators and Governors are proposing plans](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/gop-eyes-new-election-laws) to adjust how they apportion electoral votes based on proportional popular vote.  \n3. If corporations are barred from contributing money to political causes, so too should any organization that is not an individual. That means unions, non-profits and other formally organized groups of people are also barred from using money as speech. That's a dangerous proposition.  \n4. As for creating a public web site to access candidate advertising, who pays for the website? The design? The hosting? The traffic? Who maintains and updates it for every candidate? [This study](http://www.census.gov/prod/2/gov/gc/gc92_1_2.pdf) (PDF) from the 1992 Census found that there were about 513,000 elected officials. We can only assume that has grown.

Not to mention the overall decreased access.

Publicly funded mailings for candidates is unsustainable. Which candidates are able to use this service? If you don't include all of them, you're violating their First Amendment rights to free speech by prioritizing *some* speech over theirs. But if you do include all of them, then you're giving any nutjob with two thumbs and the will to fill out a form the ability to spew whatever rubbish they want into every single household in the country. Not to mention the cost of such a measure. 2012 estimates of election mailings are as high as [$375m](http://money.cnn.com/2012/10/12/news/economy/election-bailout-postal-service/index.html).

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_17n9hx", "selftext": "&gt;*\"1.What's to stop someone from going to school forever?\"*\n\nPeople would be expected to both learn and produce something of value. Also, the core idea as I visualize it sees this as more of a say, one year out of five thing. Or a few months out of the year. During that time people would have to have a plan. Significant resources would be devoted to connecting up people with similar goals so they could help one another learn faster. (in my experience, people learn faster and better when they are doing it with others) Then they would return, often to new work, renewed. People would have new skills and many of them would likely be in demand.\n\n&gt;*\"2. Many current grads have problems finding jobs in their fields. Lack of education isn't what's slowing the economy.\"*\n\nSee my answer to your next question which is related.\n\n\n&gt;*\"3.When they're recruiting people where I work, the typical shortcoming of most candidates is experience and not education.\"*  \n\nOne of the main functions of these schools would be to give people an experience working with a group of people on some complex challenge which will push them to the limits of their ability, push them to learn more.\n\nI dont think many people here see the urgency that I feel here but I suspect you someday will and will understand what I am getting at a bit more. I am just trying to make this country more of what it could be and less of a bedraggled, dispirited echo of what it was. I see some serious problems ahead in the mindset that prefers to ignore a great many realities and instead attributes laziness to a larger and larger number of people when in fact, whats happening could be likened to a game of musical chairs where each time the music stops, there are fewer chairs.  Its not a matter of not trying or not wanting to learn, its a matter of not being able to marshall the resources and time to in the current environment. What I think we should do is accept that this is a challenge of national importance and elevate learning to the primary position in our national priority structure. \n\nWe worry about terrorism. I know that this seems in a sense paradoxical, but suppose to fight terrorism, instead of warfare, the United States made itself such an indispensable part of the global future that we would be sorely missed should that assistance end, even by current \"terrorists\". Certainly some terrorists would maintain their belligerency but their base of support would be decimated by the US becoming such a powerful force for good. Thats what would happen if we deveoted even a half of our current military budget, which exceeds that of the rest of the world's combined, to learning in pursuit of reinventing our nation and the world. That would be real, not illusory national security.\n\nThe previous posters allusion to genocide or global war is not something the human race would survive, the people who think we would are delusional. The fact is, advances in technology are offering us a very bright future, one freed of the \"need\" for most of us to work. But, idleness would not be good for people's self images or futures. \n\nIn the positive future, the motivators to achieve will be different than they are now, to some extent. Money will be less important. What will be important will be changing the world in some way. To do that we have to change the way we look at learning. In the past, the reason for the existence of the educational system was to train workers to man the machines of the industrial age. Now, that need is diminishing and what we need are fresh ideas and fresh ways of looking at new problems. For example, we have some very urgent challenges in energy and earth science we have to solve in order to move forward, otherwise, we could easily fail and the human race would quite possibly not survive very far into the future. People need to be able to learn. Not just a few people, not just an elite, we all need to be able to learn if thats what we want and need and we are willing to apply ourselves.\n\nOne of the largest advantages many other countries have right now over us is their lower costs of living, public healthcare systems, public education. Americans are killing our country with stress. And its likely to get far worse. We could find ourselves in the near future with a nation of people most of whom has PTSD. Is that what we want?\n\nIts been shown that people who are under a lot of stress can't learn.  The mechanism of \"long term potentiation\" depends on the ability to synthesize proteins and create new cells in the dentate gyrus and that ability is disrupted by corticosteroids (stress hormones) in excess. Stress will eventually have permanent effects on the hippocampus and amygdala, the ability of the cells in the hippocampus to create new cells (necessary to continue the learning and integration process) appears to be seriously, as far as we can tell, irreversibly impacted by large amounts of stress for a long period of time. Its likely that these cells can only divide a specific number of times, they run into something called the hayflick limit.\n\nThats why the big stick, as opposed to the carrots, wont work.\n", "id": "t1_c8766dv", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_17n9hx", "selftext": "If you could put all that in a summary, it would be nice. ;D.

Also, the core idea as I visualize it sees this as more of a say, one year out of five thing. Or a few months out of the year. During that time people would have to have a plan. Significant resources would be devoted to connecting up people with similar goals so they could help one another learn faster. (in my experience, people learn faster and better when they are doing it with others) Then they would return, often to new work, renewed. People would have new skills and many of them would likely be in demand.\n\n&gt;*\"2. Many current grads have problems finding jobs in their fields. Lack of education isn't what's slowing the economy.\"*\n\nSee my answer to your next question which is related.\n\n\n&gt;*\"3.When they're recruiting people where I work, the typical shortcoming of most candidates is experience and not education.\"*  \n\nOne of the main functions of these schools would be to give people an experience working with a group of people on some complex challenge which will push them to the limits of their ability, push them to learn more.\n\nI dont think many people here see the urgency that I feel here but I suspect you someday will and will understand what I am getting at a bit more. I am just trying to make this country more of what it could be and less of a bedraggled, dispirited echo of what it was. I see some serious problems ahead in the mindset that prefers to ignore a great many realities and instead attributes laziness to a larger and larger number of people when in fact, whats happening could be likened to a game of musical chairs where each time the music stops, there are fewer chairs.  Its not a matter of not trying or not wanting to learn, its a matter of not being able to marshall the resources and time to in the current environment. What I think we should do is accept that this is a challenge of national importance and elevate learning to the primary position in our national priority structure. \n\nWe worry about terrorism. I know that this seems in a sense paradoxical, but suppose to fight terrorism, instead of warfare, the United States made itself such an indispensable part of the global future that we would be sorely missed should that assistance end, even by current \"terrorists\". Certainly some terrorists would maintain their belligerency but their base of support would be decimated by the US becoming such a powerful force for good. Thats what would happen if we deveoted even a half of our current military budget, which exceeds that of the rest of the world's combined, to learning in pursuit of reinventing our nation and the world. That would be real, not illusory national security.\n\nThe previous posters allusion to genocide or global war is not something the human race would survive, the people who think we would are delusional. The fact is, advances in technology are offering us a very bright future, one freed of the \"need\" for most of us to work. But, idleness would not be good for people's self images or futures. \n\nIn the positive future, the motivators to achieve will be different than they are now, to some extent. Money will be less important. What will be important will be changing the world in some way. To do that we have to change the way we look at learning. In the past, the reason for the existence of the educational system was to train workers to man the machines of the industrial age. Now, that need is diminishing and what we need are fresh ideas and fresh ways of looking at new problems. For example, we have some very urgent challenges in energy and earth science we have to solve in order to move forward, otherwise, we could easily fail and the human race would quite possibly not survive very far into the future. People need to be able to learn. Not just a few people, not just an elite, we all need to be able to learn if thats what we want and need and we are willing to apply ourselves.\n\nOne of the largest advantages many other countries have right now over us is their lower costs of living, public healthcare systems, public education. Americans are killing our country with stress. And its likely to get far worse. We could find ourselves in the near future with a nation of people most of whom has PTSD. Is that what we want?\n\nIts been shown that people who are under a lot of stress can't learn.  The mechanism of \"long term potentiation\" depends on the ability to synthesize proteins and create new cells in the dentate gyrus and that ability is disrupted by corticosteroids (stress hormones) in excess. Stress will eventually have permanent effects on the hippocampus and amygdala, the ability of the cells in the hippocampus to create new cells (necessary to continue the learning and integration process) appears to be seriously, as far as we can tell, irreversibly impacted by large amounts of stress for a long period of time. Its likely that these cells can only divide a specific number of times, they run into something called the hayflick limit.\n\nThats why the big stick, as opposed to the carrots, wont work.\n", "id": "t1_c8766dv", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_17n9hx", "selftext": "If you could put all that in a summary, it would be nice. ;D.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Yes, we allied with the Soviet Union and both Chinese governments (the Communists and the Nationalists under Chiang Kai Shek) to defeat Germany, Japan and Italy. A little known, quite unfortunate fact is that a dying Roosevelt made concessions to Stalin and the Yalta conference which will live in infamy almost as much as Pearl harbor in that the UK and the USA agreed to the postwar partition of Europe and Asia into Western and Soviet spheres of influence and horribly agreed to Stalin's demands to \"repatriate\" AGAINST THEIR WILL hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions of Russians and Eastern Europeans, many of whom died in Stalins gulags. At Yalta an infamous bar napkin was used to divide up the postwar world. The phrase \"Iron Curtain\" was used to describe the division of Europe by Nazi propaganda minister Goebbels, but the phrase stuck, eventually being used in a famous speech by Churchill. Shortly after the war America realized the depth of the mistake but by then it was too late. The damage was done. It was a real betrayal in every sense of the word. They needed our help but we were not there.\n\nIn Europe, though, the Russians, although horribly repressive, became our aliies after Hitler invaded Russia. \n\nStalin did not seem in those days to be the expansionist we later realized he was. But we should have realized how brutal he was. Hitler had, terrifyingly, a lot of support in the US, his mountain retreat was featured in Better Homes and Gardens..for example..However, we should have known..Hitler was promising as early as the 30s to exterminate the Jews and other so called \"inferior races\" (which basically meant everybody who was not Northern European and not Slavic) Also, similarly, few Americans realized the depth of Stalin's brutality due to lack of willingness to ask the difficult questions that needed to be asked about Russia.. It seems that Americans are often quite naive about the rest fo the world. We were largely unaware in America of Stalins forced collectivization of the Ukraine in which perhaps a million people died by arguably intentional starvation (a situation much like the Great Leap Forward famine in China and the famines in North Korea in recent times and currently) But, even so, its still somewhat arguable that the Russians were not as evil as the Nazis who planned to exterminate one group after another in their quest for (as Hitler put it) \"breathing room\". For example, after the Jews and Roma, he planned to eliminate the Catholics. He was building huge hangar sized gas chambers in the Channel Islands to gas Britons. We also made a mistake in China to shun contact with Mao, just as we did in Vietnam with Ho Chi Minh. Thereby missing an opportunity to reduce the bloodshed by leaving room for a moderate path - which might have led to democracy eventually. Instead we supported and trained right wing dictators and pretended to be surprised when they turned out to be bloodthirsty killers who were looting their national treasuries and living in luxury, often selling US aid and weapons on the black market, even to their enemies, while their people starved. \n\nIn China, in 1949, the Nationalists were famously brutal and corrupt. (Apart from the different nationality and the fact that they were at war, politically, the Chinese Nationalists were much like the Japanese. Its also not commonly known that the Chinese and Russian communists were not of one mind, they were often at odds.. Ironically, at one point Mao Zedong was being financed by Yale University..Also, China had a war with Vietnam. We could have made use of this division to offer a path to democracy which did not involve repression on the level it eventually did. Instead, we made the same mistake over and over again. Virtually every time we supported fascists, almost each time it resulted in blowback on a massive scale.\n\nIraq, Iran, South Korea, Indonesia, dozens of countries in Latin America .. Also, in Europe in the late 20s and early 30s US power brokers favored the Nazis and the grandfather of George W Bush, Prescot Bush, was their financier in the US. Hitler and his NSDAP claimed his ideas came from the US and he had a huge portrait of Henry Ford on his wall.

Totalitarian regimes function much more like cults than like democracy, however, its common for a society to maintain the trappings of democracy but make them impotent, and actually be ruled from within by a cult. \n\nThat is one of the most common patterns of totalitarianism, and Arendt goes into discussing it at length..giving examples.. For example, Germany maintained an entire show government that had no real power.... So did the Soviets (with their soviets)  This is a very unique and insightfult section of her book.. the middle chapters are especially valuable..\n\nI have had many friends who lived under communism and they describe a system where certain people were in reality the bosses of organizations, however they were not the official bosses.. But basically everything had to be approved by these \"political appointees\". \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_Reform_and_the_Psychology_of_Totalism\n\nBy Robert J Lifton. Lifton described criteria which define cult-like behaviors..The book was about the \"thought reform\" techniques of the PRC, but many Communist nations have variations on the theme.. But the characteristics show up again and again in cults of all kinds..\n\nIn the book, Lifton outlines the **\"Eight Criteria for Thought Reform\":** (what Americans called \"brainwashing\")\n\n**Milieu Control**. This involves the control of information and communication both within the environment and, ultimately, within the individual, resulting in a significant degree of isolation from society at large.\n\n**Mystical Manipulation**. The manipulation of experiences that appears spontaneous but is, in fact, planned and orchestrated by the group or its leaders in order to demonstrate divine authority, spiritual advancement, or some exceptional talent or insight that sets the leader and/or group apart from humanity, and that allows reinterpretation of historical events, scripture, and other experiences. Coincidences and happenstance oddities are interpreted as omens or prophecies.\n\n**Demand for Purity**. The world is viewed as black and white and the members are constantly exhorted to conform to the ideology of the group and strive for perfection. The induction of guilt and/or shame is a powerful control device used here.\n\n**Confession**. Sins, as defined by the group, are to be confessed either to a personal monitor or publicly to the group. There is no confidentiality; members' \"sins,\" \"attitudes,\" and \"faults\" are discussed and exploited by the leaders.\n\n**Sacred Science**. The group's doctrine or ideology is considered to be the ultimate Truth, beyond all questioning or dispute. Truth is not to be found outside the group. The leader, as the spokesperson for God or for all humanity, is likewise above criticism.\n\n**Loading the Language**. The group interprets or uses words and phrases in new ways so that often the outside world does not understand. This jargon consists of thought-terminating clich\u00e9s, which serve to alter members' thought processes to conform to the group's way of thinking.\n\n**Doctrine over person**. Members' personal experiences are subordinated to the sacred science and any contrary experiences must be denied or reinterpreted to fit the ideology of the group.\n\n**Dispensing of existence**. The group has the prerogative to decide who has the right to exist and who does not. This is usually not literal but means that those in the outside world are not saved, unenlightened, unconscious and they must be converted to the group's ideology. If they do not join the group or are critical of the group, then they must be rejected by the members. Thus, the outside world loses all credibility. In conjunction, should any member leave the group, he or she must be rejected also.[3]\n\n---\n\n**Thought-terminating clich\u00e9**\n\nThought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism popularized the term \"thought-terminating clich\u00e9\", which refers to a clich\u00e9 that is a commonly used phrase, sometimes passing as folk wisdom, used to quell cognitive dissonance. Though the clich\u00e9d phrase in and of itself may be valid in certain contexts, its application as a means of dismissing dissent or justifying fallacious logic is what makes it thought-terminating.\n\nLifton said:[4][5]\n\n*The language of the totalist environment is characterized by the thought-terminating clich\u00e9. The most far-reaching and complex of human problems are compressed into brief, highly reductive, definitive-sounding phrases, easily memorized and easily expressed. These become the start and finish of any ideological analysis.*\n\nIn George Orwell\u2019s novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, the fictional constructed language Newspeak is designed to reduce language entirely to a set of thought-terminating clich\u00e9s. \n\nAldous Huxley\u2019s Brave New World society uses thought-terminating clich\u00e9s in a more conventional manner, most notably in regard to the drug soma as well as modified versions of real-life platitudes, such as, \"A doctor a day keeps the jim-jams away\". \n\nHannah Arendt, in her 1963 book Eichmann in Jerusalem, describes Adolf Eichmann as an intelligent man using many of these thought-terminating clich\u00e9s to justify his actions and the role he played in the Holocaust. For her, these phrases are symptomatic of an absence of thought.\n\n---\n\nAnother characteristic of totalitarian regimes is a conscious effort to **dehumanize** or **scapegoat** groups for the failings of society..\n\nThis becomes a practice of sequential dehumanization and often, extermination directed against these perceived enemies of the state. (who often are illusory) These campaigns are used as thought terminating cliches..\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought-terminating_clich\u00e9\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehumanization\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoat\n\n", "id": "t1_c82ad1e", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_170027", "selftext": "&gt;None of the examples you gave were democracies or sprung out of democracies.. all were preceded by disorder and dysfunction.\n\nthis is just a well constructed \"No True Scotsman\" argument with interesting links (thanks!).\n\nI would argue that modern western democracies have similar, but more skillfully engineered, aspects as to what you outline above in every single point you raise.\n\ni.e. the \"show government\" consists of the parties deemed acceptable by those controlling mass media. even if the elected officials (anyone ever audit any of these major elections to ensure accuracy?) give the decisions, their vetting by a de facto oligarchy is a massive limit on choice of the citizens. \n\nthought-terminating cliches and shifting of language use abound in the modern west as well. overall i'd say you make a pretty good argument for the modern west being totalitarian than being qualitatively different than these previous regimes. if anything this should be more concerning given the greater skill in managing the show.", "id": "t1_c82almy", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "C-LAR", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c82ad1e", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431056659, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c82almy", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1358973306", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c8132z9", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431056547, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1358987018, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c82ad1e", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1358972652", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}

Then the Smart party tries to stop using insurance and after campaigning on single payer they win, only to discover that the USA, having \"made a commitment\" under the WTO's GATS treaty, is TRAPPED.\n\nSee http://www.citizen.org/documents/PresidentialWTOreport.pdf", "id": "t1_c7xqmoi", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_16mopd", "id": "t1_c7xrftu", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "classdismissed", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_16mopd", "selftext": "You don't think people would be pissed if Obamacare turned out to be a betrayal of all those people, if they realized they had been gamed?\n\nAlso, as I said, by 2017, it would, surprise, be too late.\n\nSince the Presidential candiates in 2008 both pretended to know nothing about these agreements, but later on turned out to know quite a bit, I would hope that nobody is fooled by the studied fake ignorance.\n\n------\n\nHere is an essay on the Antigua - USA dispute in the WTO\n\nInternational Economic Law Edition\n\nThe WTO Gambling Dispute: Antigua Mulls Retaliation as the U.S. Negotiates Withdrawal of its GATS Commitments\n\nBy Simon Lester\n\nhttp://www.asil.org/insights080408.cfm\n", "id": "t1_c7xrlap", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c7xs0ej", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "classdismissed", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_16mopd", "selftext": "Read this: http://tacd.org/index2.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_view&amp;gid=191&amp;Itemid=\n\nor this http://www.tacd.org/events/meeting5/P_Arnold.doc\n\nand this\n\nhttp://www.citizen.org/documents/Gamblingsummary2007.pdf\n\nand this\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19492630", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "id": "t1_c7xs7qe", "parent_id": "t1_c7xs0ej", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1435642904, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1358319031, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7xs7qe", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1358317484", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_16mopd", "selftext": "I sent you links to several other documents in another response as well as a somewhat logical (I hope) explanation of why I think the Antigua decision has important implications for the solving of the US health insurance quandary.\n\nIt would be irresponsible to allow selling insurance across state lines knowing that that could potentially make it impossible to implement a solution we know works in the future.

On the other hand, some doctors don't get it and will simply throw a battery of prescriptions, tests, and procedures at the patient, often exacerbating their problems with side effects and weird medication combinations. The uneducated **consumer** of medicine is partly the problem because they are not communicating with their providers regarding other treatments or test results. That said, many of these frequent consumers of medicine also have substantial (often undiagnosed) mental health issues, and the onus should be on the **provider** to take the appropriate steps to reduce the chance of a backslide in health or a lapse in compliance,  and manage a complex patient's comorbid chronic conditions in a holistic manner.\n\n\nThat is rather convoluted, but my point is that often it seems overworked and tired ER physicians and Urgent Care physicians fail to take a high-level view of chronic medicine consumers and make their conditions worse, at high cost, with poor results.\n\n\nI don't really have a policy proposal to offer a fix, but it seems to me that a small segment of the population is driving the overuse of medicine and some providers (especially Medicaid providers in major metro areas) are complicit in the overuse and abuse of medicine ... which drives up the cost for everyone.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7xhsal", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1358282991", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c7xmgt2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "punarvasu", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Except that your non-solution will of course result in neither the poor nor the middle class getting good healthcare or affordable healthcare.\n\nWhy can't you just accept that doctors will do the right thing?

But, every time I've tried to tell doctors about them, even after my own medical condition has dramatically improved, they don't listen. They dont read papers Ive given them. Its an exercise in futility. Doctors don't follow their own field. they can't see the forest for the trees.\n\nI know this sounds completely insane but I would be willing to bet that we could trim 10-20% (conservative estimate) off of our nations healthcare bill without having people do anything unpleasant or expensive, spending literally pennies a day (much of this could be achieved via phytomedicine). That would just be the low hanging fruit. But, lacking any credentials, (except street cred in certain circles) my suggestions are completely ignored.

Antigua won, and the WTO gave them the right to ignore US copyright law in some particular area.\n\nThats a potentially large penalty but it dwarfs the penalty the US would be subjected to were we to \"make a commitment to open our *health insurance* financial services market\" (the largest and most profitable such market in the world) to foreign trade (what they want to do, by allowing **\"selling across state lines\"**) and then, later, WITHDRAW THAT COMMITMENT.\n\n(See http://www.citizen.org/documents/PresidentialWTOreport.pdf   also http://tacd.org/index2.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_view&amp;gid=191  or http://www.tacd.org/events/meeting5/P_Arnold.doc )\n\nIt would make no difference that Americans could not afford health insurance any more in the WTO, even less than it does to the wealthy Republican and Democratic Senators and Congresspeople.

Bundled payments should help that.  *This is true regardless of who is making the payments*, this is not necessarily about private insurance vs. public financing.  \n\nI wouldn't get your hopes up too much about technology because it is only another complicated piece of the puzzle.  Technology can make things cheaper, and it can also make things more expensive.  It's all very contingent and specific.

Markets are systems of rationing.  There has always been rationing.  Until healthcare is as abundant as oxygen there will be rationing of some kind.  It's about who has control and who should make the decisions.

Controlling costs also depends on how money flows through the system, and on how prices are set, not just on the population's usage rates (how many people bought how much of what, at what price?)  The health care industry as a whole does not have incentive to see prices decline, and it is a very big industry!  In short, rather than just look at demand, you have to look at supply.  And a lot of the PPACA AFAIK is aimed at supply side reform. \n\nFee-for-service, the most straightforward and 'normal' way of paying for things, encourages over-production.  Doctors order every lab they think might be of use, every med, and they keep patients in hospital for as many billable days as they can, because they make money directly based on services provided.\n\nWith capitation, the HMO model, providers are paid up-front.  Their incentive then is to provide as little service as possible in order to make a profit- they want to keep whatever money they can save.  So they end up doing all kinds of nasty things, when the intention was to encourage preventative care.  Even with what you would expect to be very smart and compassionate people like doctors, when you get them in a system w/ managers and finance, you have to really go with the lowest common denominator as far as behavior goes.  The HMO revolution was a disaster.  The providers ended up acting like sharks, like the worst of insurance companies, driven purely by financial incentive; medicine becomes a by-product of the process, rather than the absolute priority.\n\nThe PPACA is trying to move things toward bundled payments.  Bundled payments in my understanding as of now should be some kind of mix of fee-for-service and capitation, intended to minimize the faults of each and get the best of each.  But it will undoubtedly be complex, and as of this afternoon in health economics class, there are only a small number of research institutions working on the system and they are behind schedule.  \n\nOn another note, we may hope to see a better and more balanced preventative care situation.  Fewer poor people will be forced into hospital with catastrophic problems that are so expensive and dangerous.  But this will take time in any case, and as that is happening, the aging population will rapidly expand.  Those older people will eventually end up in hospital with catastrophic, expensive problems, and there is going to be a very high proportion of them when they start showing up.  They are past the preventative care issue; if anything they are the inevitable result of good preventative care.  Doing everything possible to keep the poor, and younger population out of the hospital is absolutely a good idea, especially because of this, but no doubt there will be a lot of voices piping up, mis-characterizing a difficult situation and probably seeking to take the health system in a much less equitable and human direction.

For example, when you are running a fever, it makes sense to get treated.  When you go into for a physical, you do not need a cardio-stress test each year.  I can speak to that from personal experience - I started my career running the books for doctor's offices.  You would be amazed at how they encourage tests that really aren't needed as often as they try got give them to patients.  And yet the patient doesn't mind since it doesn't cost them anything else.  That's the definition of the third-party problem.\n\n&gt;Also people in other countries tend to take newer, name brand drugs more, and they pay less for them.\n\nIts very difficult to figure out what people pay for things in other countries as their direct costs are only a fraction of the actual total cost.

On the other hand, some doctors don't get it and will simply throw a battery of prescriptions, tests, and procedures at the patient, often exacerbating their problems with side effects and weird medication combinations. The uneducated **consumer** of medicine is partly the problem because they are not communicating with their providers regarding other treatments or test results. That said, many of these frequent consumers of medicine also have substantial (often undiagnosed) mental health issues, and the onus should be on the **provider** to take the appropriate steps to reduce the chance of a backslide in health or a lapse in compliance,  and manage a complex patient's comorbid chronic conditions in a holistic manner.\n\n\nThat is rather convoluted, but my point is that often it seems overworked and tired ER physicians and Urgent Care physicians fail to take a high-level view of chronic medicine consumers and make their conditions worse, at high cost, with poor results.\n\n\nI don't really have a policy proposal to offer a fix, but it seems to me that a small segment of the population is driving the overuse of medicine and some providers (especially Medicaid providers in major metro areas) are complicit in the overuse and abuse of medicine ... which drives up the cost for everyone.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7xhsal", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1358282991", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c7xmgt2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "punarvasu", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Except that your non-solution will of course result in neither the poor nor the middle class getting good healthcare or affordable healthcare.\n\nWhy can't you just accept that doctors will do the right thing?

I have a unique perspective on this because for decades Ive been interested in low tech high tech health \"hacks\". And a lot of those hacks work and are also cheap and would work to save literally biillions of dollars. But, every time I've tried to tell doctors about them, even after my own medical condition has dramatically improved, they don't listen. They dont read papers Ive given them. Its an exercise in futility. Doctors don't follow their own field. they can't see the forest for the trees.\n\nI know this sounds completely insane but I would be willing to bet that we could trim 10-20% (conservative estimate) off of our nations healthcare bill without having people do anything unpleasant or expensive, spending literally pennies a day (much of this could be achieved via phytomedicine). That would just be the low hanging fruit. But, lacking any credentials, (except street cred in certain circles) my suggestions are completely ignored.

Antigua won, and the WTO gave them the right to ignore US copyright law in some particular area.\n\nThats a potentially large penalty but it dwarfs the penalty the US would be subjected to were we to \"make a commitment to open our *health insurance* financial services market\" (the largest and most profitable such market in the world) to foreign trade (what they want to do, by allowing **\"selling across state lines\"**) and then, later, WITHDRAW THAT COMMITMENT.\n\n(See http://www.citizen.org/documents/PresidentialWTOreport.pdf   also http://tacd.org/index2.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_view&amp;gid=191  or http://www.tacd.org/events/meeting5/P_Arnold.doc )\n\nIt would make no difference that Americans could not afford health insurance any more in the WTO, even less than it does to the wealthy Republican and Democratic Senators and Congresspeople.

Equipment is easier to make and is already more affordable. Maybe better equipment will also mean less lawsuits. Will technology have a dramatic effect on the cost of health care? Absolutely.

Hospitals and other provider systems are strongly influenced by finance and policy, and we can't expect the outcomes we want unless we create strong policies to promote those outcomes.  Bundled payments should help that.  *This is true regardless of who is making the payments*, this is not necessarily about private insurance vs. public financing.  \n\nI wouldn't get your hopes up too much about technology because it is only another complicated piece of the puzzle.  Technology can make things cheaper, and it can also make things more expensive.  It's all very contingent and specific.  Hopefully, tho, when the baby boomer thing really starts to hit, we can use better technology to do more with less expense.  \n\nThere's a lot of irony to all this crap about rationing and free markets IMO.  Markets are systems of rationing.  There has always been rationing.  Until healthcare is as abundant as oxygen there will be rationing of some kind.  It's about who has control and who should make the decisions.  The unfortunate thing about that, for the US, is that a centralized and universal system could be much more efficient and could really help us deal with this baby boomer problem among other things.

Controlling costs also depends on how money flows through the system, and on how prices are set, not just on the population's usage rates (how many people bought how much of what, at what price?)  The health care industry as a whole does not have incentive to see prices decline, and it is a very big industry!  In short, rather than just look at demand, you have to look at supply.  And a lot of the PPACA AFAIK is aimed at supply side reform. \n\nFee-for-service, the most straightforward and 'normal' way of paying for things, encourages over-production.  Doctors order every lab they think might be of use, every med, and they keep patients in hospital for as many billable days as they can, because they make money directly based on services provided.\n\nWith capitation, the HMO model, providers are paid up-front.  Their incentive then is to provide as little service as possible in order to make a profit- they want to keep whatever money they can save.  So they end up doing all kinds of nasty things, when the intention was to encourage preventative care.  Even with what you would expect to be very smart and compassionate people like doctors, when you get them in a system w/ managers and finance, you have to really go with the lowest common denominator as far as behavior goes.  The HMO revolution was a disaster.  The providers ended up acting like sharks, like the worst of insurance companies, driven purely by financial incentive; medicine becomes a by-product of the process, rather than the absolute priority.\n\nThe PPACA is trying to move things toward bundled payments.  Bundled payments in my understanding as of now should be some kind of mix of fee-for-service and capitation, intended to minimize the faults of each and get the best of each.  But it will undoubtedly be complex, and as of this afternoon in health economics class, there are only a small number of research institutions working on the system and they are behind schedule.  \n\nOn another note, we may hope to see a better and more balanced preventative care situation.  Fewer poor people will be forced into hospital with catastrophic problems that are so expensive and dangerous.  But this will take time in any case, and as that is happening, the aging population will rapidly expand.  Those older people will eventually end up in hospital with catastrophic, expensive problems, and there is going to be a very high proportion of them when they start showing up.  They are past the preventative care issue; if anything they are the inevitable result of good preventative care.  Doing everything possible to keep the poor, and younger population out of the hospital is absolutely a good idea, especially because of this, but no doubt there will be a lot of voices piping up, mis-characterizing a difficult situation and probably seeking to take the health system in a much less equitable and human direction.

The reason people aren't able to explain the real cost of health insurance is that we are trying to force insurance to cover things that insurance of any type was never designed to cover.\n\nInsurance, by definition, is essentially a hedge against a low-risk, high cost event, such as death of the only earner in a family.  You would be willing to pay a small amount per month in case the sole earner dies, for a large cash payout to attempt to replace that income over time.  Or, to use a more classic example, paying for collision insurance to cover repairs for a car.  You don't know when it will happen, but you're willing to gamble that it will happen soon/often.  The insurance company takes the opposite position - it hopes you never get in a wreck or die after the policy expires.\n\nI can do this based on risk-profiles and actuarial assumptions.  To put it simply, they will determine that you have a 1% chance to get in a collision every year and it will cost $10k to repair the car.  So, to determine the annual premium, their base is 1% x $10k or $100.  Now this is the minimum it will take, otherwise it will lose money.  But most people are risk adverse, so they would be willing to pay $120 for that protection - or more.  If their assumptions are perfect, they will make $50 on that policy each year.  Out of that $20 profit comes all administrative expenses and anything left over is profit.  Lets say that profit for a perfectly run company is $10 on that policy.  That means Saint Non-Profit would run that policy for $110.  It need that 10% markup to cover all those expenses.\n\nNow, what happens if you decide to get Saint Non-Profit Insurance to cover gas purchases?  They go through their process and figure policyholders will have a 100% chance to spend $10k per year in fuel.  They will make the premium, at minimum, $10k.  But they need that 10% to cover their costs, so they will charge $11k for \"gas coverage\" on each customer.  Now, if you realize, customers are now overpaying for that coverage.  Some will win, some will lose on that policy, but Saint Non-Profit breaks even still.\n\nTo compare the two in health insurance, the first would be a \"catastrophic coverage\" or \"major medical\" plans.  They do not cover physicals, doctor visits, but rather ER visits, hospital stays, etc.  Things that are rare but expensive.  Again, you are hedging your bets; you figure you will need it a lot, they hope you never need it.\n\n\"Gas coverage\" in this case is what we would call \"preventative care\".  Physicals, for example, are \"free\".  But they really aren't, Saint Non-Profit still has to pay the doctor and cover their costs, so they'll take that premium that they would have charged for this coverage and try to apply it to other items.  Or simply eat the cost and eventually go out of business (remember, Saint Non-Profit makes no profit and only breaks even).\n\nNow, perhaps at some point Saint Non-Profit might see savings on the catastrophic side, but there is one other factor that this whole thing doesn't take into account that will eat Saint Non-Profit alive - its called the third-party problem.\n\nThere's an old saying that when I spend my own money, I'm careful.  When I spend my own money on others, I'm a little less careful - I want to make them happy with my gift.  But if I'm spending other people's money on me... time to party!  Just sit in any all-you-can-eat buffet and keep track of what people pull onto their plates.  Most likely they'll eat far more than if they had to pay for it by the dish and many times people will leave food uneaten.  This is an example of the third-party problem - you overconsume what seems \"free\".\n\nSo all those benefits down the road from that preventative care?  They might be eaten by that overconsumption.  Such as people going to the doctor for every sniffle.  Or allowing the doctor to run a massive battery of tests because the visit will be $30 whether he runs 1 test or 50.  It doesn't even need to be greedy doctors: it could be you deciding you want the name-brand prescription rather than the generic.  Why not?  Its the same price to you.\n\nNow, there are solutions, even single-party payer solutions, but at some point in the health insurance/healthcare market, there has to be some level of rationing of consumption.  Those solutions just vary on whom is doing the rationing.  Anyone telling you different is either lying or doesn't understand that the concept of scarce resources.", "id": "t1_c7xftd7", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "AuditorTux", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_16mrsn", "selftext": "All in all, I thought your answer was good, it explains that insurance wasn't meant to be used in the context we're trying to make it function in.\n\nThis is interesting, you probably didn't realize that lots of research shows that this part of your answer isn't true in the medical context..

Lack of access to affordable health care seems to be resulting in serious problems here. Also people in other countries tend to take newer, name brand drugs more, and they pay less for them.

On the other hand, some doctors don't get it and will simply throw a battery of prescriptions, tests, and procedures at the patient, often exacerbating their problems with side effects and weird medication combinations. The uneducated **consumer** of medicine is partly the problem because they are not communicating with their providers regarding other treatments or test results.

But, every time I've tried to tell doctors about them, even after my own medical condition has dramatically improved, they don't listen. They dont read papers Ive given them. Its an exercise in futility. Doctors don't follow their own field. they can't see the forest for the trees.\n\nI know this sounds completely insane but I would be willing to bet that we could trim 10-20% (conservative estimate) off of our nations healthcare bill without having people do anything unpleasant or expensive, spending literally pennies a day (much of this could be achieved via phytomedicine). That would just be the low hanging fruit. But, lacking any credentials, (except street cred in certain circles) my suggestions are completely ignored.

Antigua won, and the WTO gave them the right to ignore US copyright law in some particular area.\n\nThats a potentially large penalty but it dwarfs the penalty the US would be subjected to were we to \"make a commitment to open our *health insurance* financial services market\" (the largest and most profitable such market in the world) to foreign trade (what they want to do, by allowing **\"selling across state lines\"**) and then, later, WITHDRAW THAT COMMITMENT.\n\n(See http://www.citizen.org/documents/PresidentialWTOreport.pdf   also http://tacd.org/index2.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_view&amp;gid=191  or http://www.tacd.org/events/meeting5/P_Arnold.doc )\n\nIt would make no difference that Americans could not afford health insurance any more in the WTO, even less than it does to the wealthy Republican and Democratic Senators and Congresspeople.

It's about who has control and who should make the decisions.  The unfortunate thing about that, for the US, is that a centralized and universal system could be much more efficient and could really help us deal with this baby boomer problem among other things.

Controlling costs also depends on how money flows through the system, and on how prices are set, not just on the population's usage rates (how many people bought how much of what, at what price?)  The health care industry as a whole does not have incentive to see prices decline, and it is a very big industry!  In short, rather than just look at demand, you have to look at supply.  And a lot of the PPACA AFAIK is aimed at supply side reform. \n\nFee-for-service, the most straightforward and 'normal' way of paying for things, encourages over-production.  Doctors order every lab they think might be of use, every med, and they keep patients in hospital for as many billable days as they can, because they make money directly based on services provided.\n\nWith capitation, the HMO model, providers are paid up-front.  Their incentive then is to provide as little service as possible in order to make a profit- they want to keep whatever money they can save.  So they end up doing all kinds of nasty things, when the intention was to encourage preventative care.  Even with what you would expect to be very smart and compassionate people like doctors, when you get them in a system w/ managers and finance, you have to really go with the lowest common denominator as far as behavior goes.  The HMO revolution was a disaster.  The providers ended up acting like sharks, like the worst of insurance companies, driven purely by financial incentive; medicine becomes a by-product of the process, rather than the absolute priority.\n\nThe PPACA is trying to move things toward bundled payments.  Bundled payments in my understanding as of now should be some kind of mix of fee-for-service and capitation, intended to minimize the faults of each and get the best of each.  But it will undoubtedly be complex, and as of this afternoon in health economics class, there are only a small number of research institutions working on the system and they are behind schedule.  \n\nOn another note, we may hope to see a better and more balanced preventative care situation.  Fewer poor people will be forced into hospital with catastrophic problems that are so expensive and dangerous.  But this will take time in any case, and as that is happening, the aging population will rapidly expand.  Those older people will eventually end up in hospital with catastrophic, expensive problems, and there is going to be a very high proportion of them when they start showing up.  They are past the preventative care issue; if anything they are the inevitable result of good preventative care.  Doing everything possible to keep the poor, and younger population out of the hospital is absolutely a good idea, especially because of this, but no doubt there will be a lot of voices piping up, mis-characterizing a difficult situation and probably seeking to take the health system in a much less equitable and human direction.

I think that is a conservative figure. Why isn't there some way people like me can make proposals and have them evaluated in a sensible manner. There should be. If we could cut morbidity and mortality from the cluster of most expensive diseases people would live a bit longer, yes, which would cost some money, but they also would cost a lot less in terms of healthcare.

Government has no competition, and the ability to print your own currency largely insulates you from price. \n\nMake no mistake, I don't think the role of the state is to turn a profit, but if it *really* wants to maintain some semblance of a welfare safety net, then it needs revenue, and it needs it in a long-term sustainable fashion. It makes more sense to allow the free market to make its money and simply skim some cash off the top, than attempting to dictate how it is and isn't allowed to profit.\n\nI think as trade becomes more powerful and global disparity shrinks (which it will continue to do), we'll have less motivation for war and we'll be able to lessen our security needs.

They are a necessary evil. However, this evil needs to be constrained to do only what is absolutely necessary. Necessary doesn't mean what we would like, or to prevent entropy. We have a fairly objective framework laid out in the Constitution, and we ought to stick to it. We have a pretty damned good idea of what was meant by every single word (only 1700 of them) when it was written because of historical context and additional writings from those who wrote and ratified it. We can't constantly seek to re-interpret and change the rules when the \"home team\" loses.\n\n&gt; But governments seem to me to be all we've got as a structure right now.\n\nYes and no. Yes because when they aren't present or functional there is no incentive for industry to *not* pollute or abuse the commons. This would be the tragedy everyone knows. For a society to remain civil and relatively logical, it also has to main a monopoly on retributive justice and place those means under objective control based on laws. This is the rule of law as Ayn Rand describes it, and for a crazy lady, she's right.\n\nBUT\n\nA large degree of structure and order are coming from industry itself. Industry best practices for the ENTIRE tech industry (except TCP/IP) were created in the private sector and became standards without legislation. The open-source movement doesn't need state structure. The two most incredible technological revolutions to date were brought about by private industry, and they've had a measurably beneficial impact on the life of the everyday human. These two revolutions were the Internet and the Industrial Revolution.\n\nI guess if anything, this makes me a [Burkean Conservative](http://www.kirkcenter.org/index.php/detail/ten-conservative-principles/).", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_15ukyf", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7qjdr3", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357251246", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c7qiolo", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430847073, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_15ukyf", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7qiu4y", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357249597", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

In that obligation lies the other role of protector of the commons.

Government has no competition, and the ability to print your own currency largely insulates you from price. \n\nMake no mistake, I don't think the role of the state is to turn a profit, but if it *really* wants to maintain some semblance of a welfare safety net, then it needs revenue, and it needs it in a long-term sustainable fashion. It makes more sense to allow the free market to make its money and simply skim some cash off the top, than attempting to dictate how it is and isn't allowed to profit.\n\nI think as trade becomes more powerful and global disparity shrinks (which it will continue to do), we'll have less motivation for war and we'll be able to lessen our security needs.

They are a necessary evil. However, this evil needs to be constrained to do only what is absolutely necessary. Necessary doesn't mean what we would like, or to prevent entropy. We have a fairly objective framework laid out in the Constitution, and we ought to stick to it. We have a pretty damned good idea of what was meant by every single word (only 1700 of them) when it was written because of historical context and additional writings from those who wrote and ratified it. We can't constantly seek to re-interpret and change the rules when the \"home team\" loses.\n\n&gt; But governments seem to me to be all we've got as a structure right now.\n\nYes and no. Yes because when they aren't present or functional there is no incentive for industry to *not* pollute or abuse the commons. This would be the tragedy everyone knows. For a society to remain civil and relatively logical, it also has to main a monopoly on retributive justice and place those means under objective control based on laws. This is the rule of law as Ayn Rand describes it, and for a crazy lady, she's right.\n\nBUT\n\nA large degree of structure and order are coming from industry itself. Industry best practices for the ENTIRE tech industry (except TCP/IP) were created in the private sector and became standards without legislation. The open-source movement doesn't need state structure. The two most incredible technological revolutions to date were brought about by private industry, and they've had a measurably beneficial impact on the life of the everyday human. These two revolutions were the Internet and the Industrial Revolution.\n\nI guess if anything, this makes me a [Burkean Conservative](http://www.kirkcenter.org/index.php/detail/ten-conservative-principles/).", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_15ukyf", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7qjdr3", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357251246", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c7qiolo", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430847073, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_15ukyf", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7qiu4y", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357249597", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_15ukyf", "selftext": "There is very little that you have said that I necessarily disagree with.

But they have a disproportionate amount of power, largely as a result of mistakes of classification in areas like law.

In that obligation lies the other role of protector of the commons.

Government has no competition, and the ability to print your own currency largely insulates you from price. \n\nMake no mistake, I don't think the role of the state is to turn a profit, but if it *really* wants to maintain some semblance of a welfare safety net, then it needs revenue, and it needs it in a long-term sustainable fashion. It makes more sense to allow the free market to make its money and simply skim some cash off the top, than attempting to dictate how it is and isn't allowed to profit.\n\nI think as trade becomes more powerful and global disparity shrinks (which it will continue to do), we'll have less motivation for war and we'll be able to lessen our security needs. But that day is something to work towards, it isn't today.\n\n&gt; What I just had to wonder though is where you see yourself, you appeal to the Constitution and then you say that national interests or national governments ability to fully grok situations is limited..\n\nWell, I'm no statist, but I'll admit the necessity of a government and of laws. They are a necessary evil. However, this evil needs to be constrained to do only what is absolutely necessary. Necessary doesn't mean what we would like, or to prevent entropy. We have a fairly objective framework laid out in the Constitution, and we ought to stick to it. We have a pretty damned good idea of what was meant by every single word (only 1700 of them) when it was written because of historical context and additional writings from those who wrote and ratified it. We can't constantly seek to re-interpret and change the rules when the \"home team\" loses.\n\n&gt; But governments seem to me to be all we've got as a structure right now.\n\nYes and no. Yes because when they aren't present or functional there is no incentive for industry to *not* pollute or abuse the commons. This would be the tragedy everyone knows. For a society to remain civil and relatively logical, it also has to main a monopoly on retributive justice and place those means under objective control based on laws. This is the rule of law as Ayn Rand describes it, and for a crazy lady, she's right.\n\nBUT\n\nA large degree of structure and order are coming from industry itself. Industry best practices for the ENTIRE tech industry (except TCP/IP) were created in the private sector and became standards without legislation. The open-source movement doesn't need state structure. The two most incredible technological revolutions to date were brought about by private industry, and they've had a measurably beneficial impact on the life of the everyday human. These two revolutions were the Internet and the Industrial Revolution.\n\nI guess if anything, this makes me a [Burkean Conservative](http://www.kirkcenter.org/index.php/detail/ten-conservative-principles/).", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_15ukyf", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7qjdr3", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357251246", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c7qiolo", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430847073, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_15ukyf", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7qiu4y", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357249597", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_15ukyf", "selftext": "There is very little that you have said that I necessarily disagree with.

Government has no competition, and the ability to print your own currency largely insulates you from price. \n\nMake no mistake, I don't think the role of the state is to turn a profit, but if it *really* wants to maintain some semblance of a welfare safety net, then it needs revenue, and it needs it in a long-term sustainable fashion. It makes more sense to allow the free market to make its money and simply skim some cash off the top, than attempting to dictate how it is and isn't allowed to profit.\n\nI think as trade becomes more powerful and global disparity shrinks (which it will continue to do), we'll have less motivation for war and we'll be able to lessen our security needs.

They are a necessary evil. However, this evil needs to be constrained to do only what is absolutely necessary. Necessary doesn't mean what we would like, or to prevent entropy. We have a fairly objective framework laid out in the Constitution, and we ought to stick to it. We have a pretty damned good idea of what was meant by every single word (only 1700 of them) when it was written because of historical context and additional writings from those who wrote and ratified it. We can't constantly seek to re-interpret and change the rules when the \"home team\" loses.\n\n&gt; But governments seem to me to be all we've got as a structure right now.\n\nYes and no. Yes because when they aren't present or functional there is no incentive for industry to *not* pollute or abuse the commons. This would be the tragedy everyone knows. For a society to remain civil and relatively logical, it also has to main a monopoly on retributive justice and place those means under objective control based on laws. This is the rule of law as Ayn Rand describes it, and for a crazy lady, she's right.\n\nBUT\n\nA large degree of structure and order are coming from industry itself. Industry best practices for the ENTIRE tech industry (except TCP/IP) were created in the private sector and became standards without legislation.

Or, if its too expensive (which it OFTEN will be) they will get a fine, (or a free pass ON THE FINE, and be able to remain uninsured 'for free'.)\n\nOf course, the plan is to in theory keep free public education AND the healthcare age tax (premiums), but in practice that plan breaks down only because the amount of the insurance is so high it causes \"crowd out\" of other spending for almost everybody \n\nMany people have a mistaken view of the ACA bill..-Most people who don't have a plan through work *wont actually get healthcare insurance*, nor will someone give it to them, instead, they will merely **have access to** it. \n\nWhich means, in a sense it is almost a code word for, they \"could buy it\"- if they have the money. In other words, they will, if they choose to spend $1700 to $6800 a month, soon be able to purchase health insurance while *right now* many of them would be unable to purchase health insurance *at any price*. \n\nI think its very unlikely that more than a very few of our people (the highest quintile) will suddenly be able to afford it, though. Obviously the government thinks so too because they aren't pushing through huge tax increases to pay for it. They are counting on few people being able to afford their part of the costs.\n\nNote, if they are low income, they may get a *tax refund of some of that $1700/mo to $5500/mo they spent the previous year*, if they are still eligible *when they file their itemized return* at tax time the next year and the money has been appropriated for the subsidies for the poorest 2/5 of Americans.", "id": "t1_c7qdkwg", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Who has done what?

There may also be tax rebates on the difference between what a poor family paid the previous year for insurance (a *very* large percentage of their income, for the poorest 40% of Americans) and some arbitrary value.

They seem to think that what employed Americans pay as their share (along with their employers) is the cost that individuals, the uninsured and the unemployed with some income will pay under the ACA. Nothing could be farther from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The actual cost of individual insurance under the ACA will be far higher, so high that few will be able to afford it. They may get an exemption, or not, but regardless, they won&amp;#39;t suddenly be able to afford it. The subsidies will be huge and so they will prove to be extremely unpopular, especially with the working class in the second and third income quintiles, who wont be able to actually afford insurance, &lt;em&gt;despite being deemed to be able to afford it by the government&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is the divisive and soon to be controversial Catch 22.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a practical matter, due to its size, will the new health insurance &amp;quot;tax&amp;quot; based on one&amp;#39;s age, &amp;quot;crowd out&amp;quot; the &amp;quot;education tax&amp;quot;, (free public education for all children) which is (currently) not based on one&amp;#39;s age or number of your school age children or the likelihood of your having any in the future?&lt;/strong&gt; (as health insurance is priced)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to see that happen, so I am just bringing up the fact that &lt;strong&gt;many Americans DON&amp;#39;T HAVE THE MONEY FOR BOTH&lt;/strong&gt;. And nobody is about to give it to us, either. So, the ACA&amp;#39;s mandates to buy private individual insurance to everybody who does not have a large enough employer to offer them good group based insurance, will fail as you can&amp;#39;t get money from a stone..  And, preserving the insurance system is so prohibitively expensive for the middle class and the middle class&amp;#39;s resources so already stretched thin that public education is in a sense being targeted by the healthcare and insurance industries.  They don&amp;#39;t see themselves as having any choice, its public education or them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are in denial: Healthcare insurance is as expensive as a mortgage on a new home. Nothing else is comparable in cost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With ages to access Social Security and Medicare benefits rising and wages and employment potentially falling, the Congress and Senate are literally insane to want to preserve the insurance system, which imposes this unfunded mandate on families, this tax called an &amp;quot;insurance premium&amp;quot; which is now and will remain equivalent in cost to a new home or several additional children. If they fail to pay the tax, they are and WILL CONTINUE TO be refused healthcare services until after they become so indigent that they only have $2500 in assets, total or less.  BUT, AMERICANS STILL NEED AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What does the ACA do? It tries to end free riding. That is its #1 goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it does not do anything to cut costs and in that respects it was a huge missed opportunity, Obama took the things that could have lowered costs off the table in response to pressure on him by the drug and health insurance industries (who ended up writing the ACA bill)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What will make it easier for families in the second and third income quintiles to afford health insurance?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THEY WILL BE EXEMPTED FROM PAYING A SMALL FINE&lt;/em&gt;  Generally, they will be the people who own their own homes and sometimes, own small businesses. They will likely not be eligible for any help and they may (unless they have employees) be required to pay higher individual rates as well. That didn&amp;#39;t change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, property owners already pay property tax, which is in a sense, an &amp;quot;education tax&amp;quot; regardless of whether or not they have school age children. It varies from community to community but generally it is quite a bit less than health insurance, even in states that tax their residents heavily. Nonetheless, many people have trouble affording it. Imagine how much trouble many people will have affording a new &amp;quot;tax&amp;quot; which is several times larger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The old who are not old enough for Medicare will be hit especially hard by the higher costs, and those living in less affluent communities will also pay more, or if they remain uninsured, they all must pay a fine, unless they are exempt.

They seem to think that what employed Americans pay as their share (along with their employers) is the cost that individuals, the uninsured and the unemployed with some income will pay under the ACA. Nothing could be farther from the truth.\n\nThe actual cost of individual insurance under the ACA will be far higher, so high that few will be able to afford it. They may get an exemption, or not, but regardless, they won't suddenly be able to afford it. The subsidies will be huge and so they will prove to be extremely unpopular, especially with the working class in the second and third income quintiles, who wont be able to actually afford insurance, *despite being deemed to be able to afford it by the government*.\n\nThat is the divisive and soon to be controversial Catch 22.\n\nSo...\n\n**As a practical matter, due to its size, will the new health insurance \"tax\" based on one's age, \"crowd out\" the \"education tax\", (free public education for all children) which is (currently) not based on one's age or number of your school age children or the likelihood of your having any in the future?** (as health insurance is priced)\n\nI don't want to see that happen, so I am just bringing up the fact that **many Americans DON'T HAVE THE MONEY FOR BOTH**. And nobody is about to give it to us, either. So, the ACA's mandates to buy private individual insurance to everybody who does not have a large enough employer to offer them good group based insurance, will fail as you can't get money from a stone..  And, preserving the insurance system is so prohibitively expensive for the middle class and the middle class's resources so already stretched thin that public education is in a sense being targeted by the healthcare and insurance industries.  They don't see themselves as having any choice, its public education or them. \n\nWe are in denial: Healthcare insurance is as expensive as a mortgage on a new home. Nothing else is comparable in cost.\n\nWith ages to access Social Security and Medicare benefits rising and wages and employment potentially falling, the Congress and Senate are literally insane to want to preserve the insurance system, which imposes this unfunded mandate on families, this tax called an \"insurance premium\" which is now and will remain equivalent in cost to a new home or several additional children. If they fail to pay the tax, they are and WILL CONTINUE TO be refused healthcare services until after they become so indigent that they only have $2500 in assets, total or less.  BUT, AMERICANS STILL NEED AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE. \n\nWhat does the ACA do? It tries to end free riding. That is its #1 goal.\n\nBut it does not do anything to cut costs and in that respects it was a huge missed opportunity, Obama took the things that could have lowered costs off the table in response to pressure on him by the drug and health insurance industries (who ended up writing the ACA bill)\n\nWhat will make it easier for families in the second and third income quintiles to afford health insurance?\n\n*THEY WILL BE EXEMPTED FROM PAYING A SMALL FINE*  Generally, they will be the people who own their own homes and sometimes, own small businesses. They will likely not be eligible for any help and they may (unless they have employees) be required to pay higher individual rates as well. That didn't change.\n\nOf course, property owners already pay property tax, which is in a sense, an \"education tax\" regardless of whether or not they have school age children. It varies from community to community but generally it is quite a bit less than health insurance, even in states that tax their residents heavily. Nonetheless, many people have trouble affording it. Imagine how much trouble many people will have affording a new \"tax\" which is several times larger.\n\nThe old who are not old enough for Medicare will be hit especially hard by the higher costs, and those living in less affluent communities will also pay more, or if they remain uninsured, they all must pay a fine, unless they are exempt. But then they will remain uninsured.\n\nSome ballpark figures are given below, for example, around $50k a year will buy a New York family health insurance. \n\n____\n\nhttp://pnhp.org/blog/2009/04/28/new-york-hmopos-death-spiral/\n\nApril 2009\n\nNew York County\n\nMonthly family premium rates for Point of Service Plans (POS)\n\n$4450 \u2013 Aetna Health.

There may also be tax rebates on the difference between what a poor family paid the previous year for insurance (a *very* large percentage of their income, for the poorest 40% of Americans) and some arbitrary value.

We examine earnings mobility among pairs of fathers and sons as well as fathers and daughters using both mobility matrices and regression and correlation coefficients. Our results suggest that all countries exhibit substantial earnings persistence across generations, but with statistically significant differences across countries. Mobility is lower in the U.S. than in the U.K., where it is lower again compared to the Nordic countries. Persistence is greatest in the tails of the distributions and tends to be particularly high in the upper tails: though in the U.S. this is reversed with a particularly high likelihood that sons of the poorest fathers will remain in the lowest earnings quintile. This is a challenge to the popular notion of 'American exceptionalism'. The U.S. also differs from the Nordic countries in its very low likelihood that sons of the highest earners will show downward 'long-distance' mobility into the lowest earnings quintile. In this, the U.K. is more similar to the U.S..\n\nhttp://ftp.iza.org/dp1938.pdf", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c7nz1di", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "ustk31", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "me too..

I think that they will probably get vouchers that will pay for some kind of healthcare partially, but the cost of healthcare in those low value plans is huge, so they will need substantial subsidies to make the care affordable.. I suspect that Congress wont be able to agree on this issue and it will prove that we wasted six to eight years on something which anybody could have told us would happen.\n\nMedicaid is not insurance, medicaid is only available to the most indigent people, and its a loan, at least in theory, people have to pay it back, and I think potentially, the amount of money which ends up not going to their children, to the next generation, is substantial. The same problem occurs because of these unnecessary premiums, and out of pocket costs.\n\nWhat being in medicaid would do to people is make it so they could not get a better job without suddenly not being able to afford healthcare. So, its in a very real sense a worker nullification program. \n\nLook at all the money people will have to spend, as much as a new mortgage for many people.\n\nIn Canada, that money would go to the next generation. The difference will be very noticeable, I think as much as half a million dollars per person over the course of a lifetime.\n\nThe bizarre thing is that the US government currently pays more than 60% of all healthcare bills in the US, in other words, we are already paying in taxes what we could be spending to have a completely free, single payer system. if we simply eliminated the tiers which create a lot of the waste.. Because many hospitals, doctors, etc, expend literally half their staff in billing expenses.. Thats a huge amount of money. Wasted on something that gives us no value and in fact, can easily be show to reduce health and make outcomes measurably worse.. \n\nSee the research at http://www.pnhp.org - Its around a million times more credible than the \"ACA\"\n\nThe ACA is not \"affordable\" despite its name.\n\nEven the World Bank recommends eliminating user fees in poor countries.

As a canadian, you should be familiar with the many studies that have been done on user fees. Basically, its been found that to have user fees (insurance premiums and co-pays) actually makes healthcare more expensive in the long run.. The fact is, that people who get care earlier end up costing a lot less in the long run. the US system wastes more than a third of every dollar that goes into it, part of the reason is the complexity of having more than 1500 different payers.\n\nThis web page \"busts the myth\" that having user fees (charging people money to access healthcare services) saves money..\n\nPDF version here:\nhttp://www.cfhi-fcass.ca/Libraries/Mythbusters/Myth_User_Fees_EN.sflb.ashx\n\n\nHTML version here:\n\nMyth: User Fees Ensure Better Use of Health Services:\nhttp://www.cfhi-fcass.ca/PublicationsAndResources/Mythbusters/ArticleView/12-11-12/519f623f-b805-4550-93a5-648e60b8aad3.aspx\n\n\nHere are the references used in the story:\nReferences\n\n1.

It depends a lot on how you phrase the question, let me see if I can find the URL..\n\nHere it is:\nhttp://pnhp.org/blog/2009/12/06/two-thirds-support-1/\n\nTwo-thirds of Americans support Medicare-for-all (#1 of 6)\nPosted by Andy Coates, MD on Sunday, Dec 6, 2009\n\n\nTwo-thirds of Americans support Medicare-for-all (#1 of 6)\n\nIntroduction to a Six-part Series\nBy Kip Sullivan, JD\n\n\u201cAmericans are scared to death of single payer.\u201d\n\nThese words were not uttered by some foaming-at-the mouth wingnut. They were written by Bernie Horn, a Senior Fellow at the Campaign for America\u2019s Future, a member of Health Care for America Now, on June 8, 2009. Horn explained that he was moved to write this tripe because single-payer supporters were asking why Democrats had taken single-payer off the table to make room for the \u201cpublic option\u201d:\n\nThe question most frequently asked by progressive activists at last week\u2019s America\u2019s Future Now conference was this: We hear Obama and congressional Democrats talking about a public health insurance option, but why aren\u2019t they talking about a single-payer system like HR 676 sponsored by Rep. John Conyers? Why is single-payer \u201coff the table\u201d?\n\nHorn went on to assert that single-payer had been taken off the table because Americans want it off the table. He claimed polling data supported him, but he cited no particular poll. The truth is that the Campaign for America\u2019s Future (CAF) and other groups in Health Care for America Now (HCAN) had decided years earlier they would push Democratic candidates and officeholders to substitute the \u201coption\u201d for single-payer, and they would tell both Democrats and progressive activists that Americans \u201clike the insurance they have\u201d and that Americans oppose single-payer.\n\nThe argument that single-payer is \u201cpolitically infeasible\u201d is not new. That argument is as old as the modern single-payer movement (which emerged in the late 1980s). It is an argument made exclusively by Democrats who don\u2019t want to support single-payer legislation \u2013 a group Merton Bernstein and Ted Marmor have called \u201cyes buts.\u201d\n\nThe traditional version of the \u201cyes but\u201d excuse has been that the insurance industry is too powerful to beat or, more simply, that \u201cthere just aren\u2019t 60 votes in the Senate for single-payer.\u201d But the leaders of the \u201coption\u201d movement felt they needed a more persuasive version of the traditional \u201cyes but\u201d excuse. The version they invented was much more insidious. They decided to say that American \u201cvalues,\u201d not American insurance companies, are the major impediment to single-payer.\n\nHow did the \u201coption\u201d movement\u2019s leaders know that Americans oppose single-payer? According to Jacob Hacker, the intellectual leader of the \u201coption\u201d movement, they knew it because existing polling data said so. According to people like Bernie Horn and Roger Hickey at CAF, they knew it because focus group \u201cresearch\u201d and a poll conducted by pollster Celinda Lake on behalf of the \u201coption\u201d movement said so. ...\n\ncontinued at the url above..\n\nhttp://pnhp.org/blog/2009/12/06/two-thirds-support-1/", "id": "t1_c7nzn0r", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c7nz2kk", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1430802921, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_15n2uh", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7nzn0r", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1356824421", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}

(Edit: In the context of outcomes in healthcare systems, invariably nonprofit systems, in other countries, not the US. I feel the nonprofit approach to be far more professional. I see healthcare as incompatible with what many represent as the ideal- \"free market economics\".)\n\nIn the past people could behave in ways they cannot now, economically.\n\n Back then, people could move freely around the world, so if the economic atmosphere in a nation was unworkable for somebody, they could and sometimes did vote with their feet and leave. Not that they should, or that that would be positive or desirable, but I am basically trying to say that to claim that X is \"free market\" behavior when Y isn't, is subject to many interpretations.\n\nIts arguable that when the rights to national markets are bought and sold in a manner reminiscent of the slave trade. Or serfdom. That that creates an intolerable situation for the common people fairly rapidly. \n\nIf we were truly a free market economy, people would be empowered to buy or sell anything that they desired, within certain limits.  We're not free when it suits the powerful, but then they want us to be free when it suits their purposes. Its a patchwork quilt of hypocrisy.\n\nFor example, if a Rx drug to treat some serious illness, cost $0.11 a dose in one country and $111 a dose in another, and both come from the same factory and in fact, are the same exact drug, in a true \"free market economy\" we would have the choice to buy from the highest value, lowest cost provider, if we desired to. But, we don't.\n\nMedicine is an example of an area where there is arguably a need for the government to lead more than they are currently leading in the US. \n\nIf you watch this video, they compare healthcare systems in a number of different countries..\n\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/sickaroundtheworld/", "id": "t1_c7o0d3g", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_15n2uh", "id": "t1_c7o0vui", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sheriffofreddit", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I'm sorry to say but if you look at HEALTHCARE which we are doing, aren't we, the successes in terms of outcomes tend to be in nations that regulate healthcare a LOT more than we do.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "They don't say \"you will be healthy\" In my impression, that's happening in the US. Basically, the interests who are responsible for the high cost of healthcare are clutching at one straw after another to try to blame the high cost of healthcare in the US on anything but themselves. Blame it on malpractice awards.. nope, malpractice awards and lawsuits are at all time lows.. sorry. Blame it on obesity.. Well, obesity may be caused by environmental obesogens like pthalates and bisphenol a, its not simply a matter of personal habits, its more complicated than that. There may be environmental causes.. And also, mortality and morbidity turns out to be lower than many would lead us to beleive, in short, obesity is not to blame for high healthcare costs, blame it on high utilization of health care.. it turns out that Americans use less healthcare than citizens in most other developed nations, and with a few exceptions in areas which are clearly related to lack of access to affordable healthcare (especially dental care) they are not substantially less healthy either. (although they are heavier, see above)\n\nThey should realize that with many health issues, the illness itself has an almost negligible cost and the cost that is potentially great is the cost of NO treatment. In other words, they have it backwards. Treatment=cost pennies a month No treatment=cost potentially thousands of dollars or loss of crucial abilities that people need to take care of themselves (in the case of some issues)  More often than not, this all revolves around medication like blood pressure medication. When people dont have the money to buy often wildly overpriced drugs, bad things happen.

There is usually almost no reason to visit the doctor every three months, say, once a year would be more appropriate for most people.

As an experiment we should make such a system available to people to choose if they wanted it, in exchange they could access a higher level of care when they needed it (when something had changed) This would be a win win for everybody.

They do not get a good enough job because they don't contribute enough to our society, which is proven because, according to capitalism, people are paid according to their societal worth (the entire concept of wages). \n\nFor a concrete example, I worked hard in high school in order to go to college, then my hard work in college showed I have the work ethic and intelligence/education necessary to do a job with a valuable enough contribution to society to pay me a sufficient amount to cover healthcare. On the other hand, my brother didn't work hard in high school, dropped out of community college, and now works for minimum wage with no benefits. His employer obviously does not value him enough to pay him enough to cover healthcare (which is an expensive service by nature, not just because of our current system). He had the same opportunities I did, yet instead of working hard, he slacked, and due to this he isn't able to afford his own insurance. So why should I have to pay for his laziness? \n\nYou've made it clear throughout this post that you feel that healthcare is a human right, in the same vein as the right to free speech. So is food a human right as well? what about shelter, or heating/AC? In today's society, computers and the internet are becoming integral parts of our world, so is internet access a human right? How about having a car? You can easily get carried away, by slowly but surely adding more things to the list of 'human rights' until we are left at a purely communist state where the government provides everything. At this point, what is the incentive to work? Everyone would become lazy and the government would provide it all. But wait, at this point who would actually be doing the work? Nobody is left to put in the labor! This is the (theoretical) problem with too much welfare\n\nTL;DR: the opportunity to achieve is a human right, but the spoils of achievement are not", "edited": 1356829537, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_15n2uh", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7o0qun", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1356829116", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c7o02vu", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430803216, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1356827085, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7o07zo", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1356826901", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c7o00z6", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430803144, "controversiality": 0, "body": "If the founding fathers thought healthcare was a human right, why did they not include it in the bill of rights?\n\nAlso edit to clarify: if you notice in my first post, I say that I tend to be liberal and I think that social programs such as national healthcare, public education, and unemployment benefits should exist becuase, like you said, we should judge it based on results, not ideology.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_15gwy9", "selftext": "In my experience, people emerging from college vary a great deal in their levels of expertise. Its no guarantee at all of somebody being able to do a job. A smart employer will spend at least a day personally interviewing each applicant and ideally, will have that applicant go around from one potential co worker to another, and have each one of them grill the applicant - have them do some major problem solving to see what they know. These days many employers hire only after two or more often three interviews. Each one winnows down the potential field. Parts of your interviews will be by a committee. You'll sit in front of a panel of people and you have to blow them away. Even so, they will probably have several people who are really good. Its that competitive now.\n\nIf a person can pass that kind of interview process, they clearly do know how to do the job.\n\nAnother way to get experience is through an internship, but, that means working for free, for a year or more, which few people can afford to do. Better to be ready for a hostile job market, where the only way to get a job is to already know how to do it well enough to get aid to do it.\n\nThe point I am making is that employers rarely want a beginner anymore. They want somebody who can hit the ground running and wear many hats..someone who already knows the field. Many college students are not prepared for that - they don't realize that this is what it takes now. In technical fields it means that when somebody goes to college, they should already have some fairly high level of knowledge in their major, so they can hit the ground running in college. For example, in the sciences, many college-bound students already have done college level work in high school, meaning some kind of research, and if they have won some prize or made some kind of contribution to their area, its very good. People should try to publish. Even if they are not in college, they should try to publish their work, whatever they do, on some level. Even if it is just on the Web. Develop a set of contacts in your area, in computing fields, and the sciences, people have to realize that the entire world is the scientific community. It is not just their geographic area. The whole world is your community.\n\nIf you grok all this, then by the time you get out of college, you may already have a job.

Our hyper tiered system is not only providing very low quality healthcare to the poor and those in HMOs which seems to be continually declining in quality relative to other nations. Its also causing healthcare for the wealthy to decline in quality as a result of the impossibility of maintaining two separate levels of healthcare in a manner that does not expose medical professionals to liability. Perhaps partly because their business model (and the huge waste which our system creates) also creates a situation where the choice for providers of healthcare services is to either go to a situation with segregation just like that in the old South. Lets call that the two waiting room scenario.. Or dumb down the care for everybody..Say in the past an imaging provider would provide more information to their self pay and fee for service insurance clients, but would just provide a binary 1 or 0 kind of data to the HMO clients.. They only can do this if they keep the clients separated..\n\nBut that is really expensive and there is still the risk that by providing high quality care to the wealthy, who often self pay, they will be called to task for not providing it to the merely \"insured\". *So, many providers, faced with pressure by HMOS to diagnose less illness, or give up business to other providers, increasingly are lowering the standard of care for everybody!* Or so I've heard many times.\n\nHave a nice weekend!", "id": "t1_c7nhz8e", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c7nhv83", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430794467, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1356734454, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_15iz8v", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7nhz8e", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1356733767", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

Generating revenue by essentially imposing a tax on illness is not good policy. If the goal is to ensure better use of health services, finding and eliminating inefficiencies across the continuum of care holds much more promise.\n\n    Tags: Healthcare financing Public/private mix \n\nTough economic times stir up anxiety over the affordability of public services\u2014especially healthcare. As governments struggle to balance budgets, and healthcare spending continues to grow faster than the economy, conditions are ripe for old\u2014and often discredited\u2014policy ideas to make a comeback. User fees are no exception. At first blush, user fees appear to be an obvious solution. After all, any policy that promises to generate revenue[1] and reduce costs by deterring unnecessary use is hard to ignore.[1,2]  But as research has shown over the years, the silver bullet of user fees really is the stuff of fantasy.[3]\n\nThe evidence indicates that implementing a medical toll booth to reduce healthcare traffic along a particular route can obstruct access to needed care, especially for those that are poor.[4]  Viewing patients as responsible for the high costs of healthcare ignores the evidence against user fees and the opportunities for greater efficiency that can be found along the continuum of care.[5]  A medical toll booth simply won\u2019t do the trick.\n\nThe Tangle of Necessary and Unnecessary Care\n\nThe RAND Health Insurance Experiment, the largest and most rigorous study of user fees to date, found that the more patients had to pay for care, the less they used it.[6,7]  Less care led to lower costs, but it didn\u2019t mean greater efficiency, because sometimes people received fewer services when they actually needed more. Patients did reduce their use of less-effective care, but there was a decrease in the use of effective care as well.[7]  The RAND findings also showed that the proportion of inappropriate hospital stays and admissions was the same with or without user fees.[8]\n\nThe RAND findings have stood the test of time. In one study, user fees lowered the appropriate use of effective prevention services and medications to help manage chronic diseases.[4]  User fees have also been shown to reduce inappropriate as well as appropriate antibiotic use to a similar extent.[9]\n\nSavings At Any Cost\n\n\nIn Canada, user fees were introduced in Saskatchewan in the sixties and seventies. Subsequent research found that they reduced the annual use of physician services by almost 6%. Notably, low-income families reduced their use of physician services by about 18%.[10]  Saskatchewan's overall healthcare costs, however, did not go down. Indeed, over the period user fees were levied, physician fees increased and high income earners on average increased their use of physician services.[11]\n\n\nUser fees may also cause some people to forego necessary treatment. In Quebec, for instance, when the elderly and people on welfare had to pay user fees for prescription drugs, they took less medicine and their conditions worsened. **As a result, they ended up with more visits to emergency departments and an increase in serious adverse events.[12]**\n\n\n**A study of seniors insured through U.S. Medicare found that raising user fees for physician visits and prescriptions increased Medicare costs.[13]  As in Quebec, many patients stopped taking their medications and ended up in the hospital.** These findings are supported by a 2007 systematic review of prescription drug cost-sharing.[14] Researchers found that although it is not certain that user fees lead to negative outcomes for all patients, their effect on the chronically ill was clear: increased emergency department use and hospitalizations.[14]\n\nWho Pays the Price\n\n\nThe Canada Health Act effectively bans user fees for two main health services: hospitals and physicians.[15]  There are good reasons for this. User fees shift costs to those that use the system the most: sick people. This amounts to a tax on poverty and age, since the poor and the elderly are less healthy than other groups.[15,16,17,18]\n\n\nThe poor are especially sensitive to these fees, which have led to policies that exempt them from user charges. A 2010 report examining the possibility of a health deductible in Quebec suggested that such an exemption would thwart much of the revenue-generating potential of user fees.[19]  Because healthcare utilization tends to be concentrated among low-income Canadians, low-income exemptions would significantly reduce the proportion of patients paying user fees.[19]\n\n\nThe poor are negatively affected by user fees in other ways, too. A study looking at the effects of prescription drug user fees found that low-income patients were more likely to stop taking medications to treat chronic disease.[20]  These results are not surprising, as in the RAND study adverse health effects due to a decline in care were concentrated among low-income families.[21,7]\n\nUser fees are a blunt instrument for targeting waste. They are aimed exclusively at patients, but patients have very little control over which medical services they use.[11,22]  Patients choose whether or not to visit a doctor, but ongoing care and big-ticket items are ordered by physicians, the \u201cgatekeepers\u201d of the healthcare system.[23,11,22]  What\u2019s more, physician fees account for only 14% of healthcare expenditures.[24]  Patients are not solely responsible for the high costs of healthcare,[3] so it doesn\u2019t make sense to put cost containment on their shoulders.\nConclusion\n\nWhile user fees are effectively banned for hospitals and family physicians in Canada, we continue to have them for many other aspects of healthcare.[25]  \n\nIf our goal is to ensure better use of health services, the evidence shows that user fees have not been capable of achieving it. Finding and eliminating inefficiencies across the continuum of care holds much more promise. The shift toward integrated and coordinated care delivery systems is encouraging, especially where they have been designed to meet the needs of specific populations.[26]  That said, efforts to integrate healthcare services continue to be frustrated by user fees (routinely required for visits to physiotherapists, psychologists and for home care support, etc.) that can create access barriers to the most appropriate services.\nReferences\n\n1.

Privatizing education gives us a bargaining chip in international trade, we can give foreign multinationals access to our educational services market, in exchange to access to still profitable emergent markets for our companies.

The firms will take around 60-75% of the salaries and the teachers will still get paid more than they would at home. Like healthcare, they see education as too profitable to be public, they see public education as a theft of a profitable global market segment from its rightful owners, corporations.\n\n2.)

Paradoxically, a great amount of research says that we would spend much less (even on a per-person basis) under single payer than under the current system. There are a number of reasons.. One of the main reason is catching illnesses earlier and being able to apply inexpensive fixes by providing appropriate care without the inevitable delay that comes from user fees making the problems much larger before they are addressed. That has been shown to save a lot of money. Google Rand study of healthcare utilization. Also the Canadian government has a web page whose URL I have to find for you in a bit that gathers together all the studies.

Generating revenue by essentially imposing a tax on illness is not good policy. If the goal is to ensure better use of health services, finding and eliminating inefficiencies across the continuum of care holds much more promise.\n\n    Tags: Healthcare financing Public/private mix \n\nTough economic times stir up anxiety over the affordability of public services\u2014especially healthcare. As governments struggle to balance budgets, and healthcare spending continues to grow faster than the economy, conditions are ripe for old\u2014and often discredited\u2014policy ideas to make a comeback. User fees are no exception. At first blush, user fees appear to be an obvious solution. After all, any policy that promises to generate revenue[1] and reduce costs by deterring unnecessary use is hard to ignore.[1,2]  But as research has shown over the years, the silver bullet of user fees really is the stuff of fantasy.[3]\n\nThe evidence indicates that implementing a medical toll booth to reduce healthcare traffic along a particular route can obstruct access to needed care, especially for those that are poor.[4]  Viewing patients as responsible for the high costs of healthcare ignores the evidence against user fees and the opportunities for greater efficiency that can be found along the continuum of care.[5]  A medical toll booth simply won\u2019t do the trick.\n\nThe Tangle of Necessary and Unnecessary Care\n\nThe RAND Health Insurance Experiment, the largest and most rigorous study of user fees to date, found that the more patients had to pay for care, the less they used it.[6,7]  Less care led to lower costs, but it didn\u2019t mean greater efficiency, because sometimes people received fewer services when they actually needed more. Patients did reduce their use of less-effective care, but there was a decrease in the use of effective care as well.[7]  The RAND findings also showed that the proportion of inappropriate hospital stays and admissions was the same with or without user fees.[8]\n\nThe RAND findings have stood the test of time. In one study, user fees lowered the appropriate use of effective prevention services and medications to help manage chronic diseases.[4]  User fees have also been shown to reduce inappropriate as well as appropriate antibiotic use to a similar extent.[9]\n\nSavings At Any Cost\n\n\nIn Canada, user fees were introduced in Saskatchewan in the sixties and seventies. Subsequent research found that they reduced the annual use of physician services by almost 6%. Notably, low-income families reduced their use of physician services by about 18%.[10]  Saskatchewan's overall healthcare costs, however, did not go down. Indeed, over the period user fees were levied, physician fees increased and high income earners on average increased their use of physician services.[11]\n\n\nUser fees may also cause some people to forego necessary treatment. In Quebec, for instance, when the elderly and people on welfare had to pay user fees for prescription drugs, they took less medicine and their conditions worsened. **As a result, they ended up with more visits to emergency departments and an increase in serious adverse events.[12]**\n\n\n**A study of seniors insured through U.S. Medicare found that raising user fees for physician visits and prescriptions increased Medicare costs.[13]  As in Quebec, many patients stopped taking their medications and ended up in the hospital.** These findings are supported by a 2007 systematic review of prescription drug cost-sharing.[14] Researchers found that although it is not certain that user fees lead to negative outcomes for all patients, their effect on the chronically ill was clear: increased emergency department use and hospitalizations.[14]\n\nWho Pays the Price\n\n\nThe Canada Health Act effectively bans user fees for two main health services: hospitals and physicians.[15]  There are good reasons for this. User fees shift costs to those that use the system the most: sick people. This amounts to a tax on poverty and age, since the poor and the elderly are less healthy than other groups.[15,16,17,18]\n\n\nThe poor are especially sensitive to these fees, which have led to policies that exempt them from user charges. A 2010 report examining the possibility of a health deductible in Quebec suggested that such an exemption would thwart much of the revenue-generating potential of user fees.[19]  Because healthcare utilization tends to be concentrated among low-income Canadians, low-income exemptions would significantly reduce the proportion of patients paying user fees.[19]\n\n\nThe poor are negatively affected by user fees in other ways, too. A study looking at the effects of prescription drug user fees found that low-income patients were more likely to stop taking medications to treat chronic disease.[20]  These results are not surprising, as in the RAND study adverse health effects due to a decline in care were concentrated among low-income families.[21,7]\n\nUser fees are a blunt instrument for targeting waste. They are aimed exclusively at patients, but patients have very little control over which medical services they use.[11,22]  Patients choose whether or not to visit a doctor, but ongoing care and big-ticket items are ordered by physicians, the \u201cgatekeepers\u201d of the healthcare system.[23,11,22]  What\u2019s more, physician fees account for only 14% of healthcare expenditures.[24]  Patients are not solely responsible for the high costs of healthcare,[3] so it doesn\u2019t make sense to put cost containment on their shoulders.\nConclusion\n\nWhile user fees are effectively banned for hospitals and family physicians in Canada, we continue to have them for many other aspects of healthcare.[25]  \n\nIf our goal is to ensure better use of health services, the evidence shows that user fees have not been capable of achieving it. Finding and eliminating inefficiencies across the continuum of care holds much more promise. The shift toward integrated and coordinated care delivery systems is encouraging, especially where they have been designed to meet the needs of specific populations.[26]  That said, efforts to integrate healthcare services continue to be frustrated by user fees (routinely required for visits to physiotherapists, psychologists and for home care support, etc.) that can create access barriers to the most appropriate services.\nReferences\n\n1.

I have my ideas but am looking forward to reading the link you provided.\n\n Having just read a couple of good books about our ability to make predictions in a complex world- \"Everything is Obvious, Once You Know the Answer\" by Duncan Watts, and \"The Signal and the Noise\" by Nate Silver- I wonder if a two tiered system would be better for an affluent country like the US? We must take care of the poor among us. Seems like the choices made by the poor (whether due to their poverty or not) should not be the \"rate limiting step\" in our health care system design. Why not have two systems compete side by side? We can learn from this arrangement which features of each work the best and which features lead to problems. Anyway...food for thought.

Health care, even under single payer, would be funded by federal income taxes so I have a hard time seeing one crowd out the other. Another counter-argument I would make is that even under the scenario you paint, I wonder how many (and what power they possess) business leaders have the view you have illustrated? Most business in the US is still small business and those leaders do not think on the scale you are talking about. They have kids and grandkids as well and it seems to me they would work to make the current system better rather than turn it over to an untested new system. I see the big picture you are painting, I just have a hard time connecting the individual dots. It would make more sense to me that Conservative minded folks would resist the concentration of power you are granting to big business and would ultimately oppose the scenario you illustrate.\n \nRegarding health care, yes cost is the big problem. Conservatives see single payer as ultimately making costs greater. The more we attempt to insulate the individual from the costs of consuming health care, the more they will consume. In the end, we all pay more and the costs are getting unsustainable. But there still is a very ambiguous link (to the individual) between the choices we make and the associated costs. I am a huge fan of high deductible plans and HSAs. They brought consumer choice back into the equation. They drove better conversations with our doctor regarding the value of certain tests, imaging, etc. Ultimately the best way to lower health care costs is to have a healthier population and a better way to medically manage the end of our lives. Or perhaps technology will rescue us?\n\nAppreciate your intelligent response.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7na0jv", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1356701654", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c7n2qtr", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1430788083, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1356669210, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_15iz8v", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7n4pr9", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1356667745", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}

Generating revenue by essentially imposing a tax on illness is not good policy. If the goal is to ensure better use of health services, finding and eliminating inefficiencies across the continuum of care holds much more promise.\n\n    Tags: Healthcare financing Public/private mix \n\nTough economic times stir up anxiety over the affordability of public services\u2014especially healthcare. As governments struggle to balance budgets, and healthcare spending continues to grow faster than the economy, conditions are ripe for old\u2014and often discredited\u2014policy ideas to make a comeback. User fees are no exception. At first blush, user fees appear to be an obvious solution. After all, any policy that promises to generate revenue[1] and reduce costs by deterring unnecessary use is hard to ignore.[1,2]  But as research has shown over the years, the silver bullet of user fees really is the stuff of fantasy.[3]\n\nThe evidence indicates that implementing a medical toll booth to reduce healthcare traffic along a particular route can obstruct access to needed care, especially for those that are poor.[4]  Viewing patients as responsible for the high costs of healthcare ignores the evidence against user fees and the opportunities for greater efficiency that can be found along the continuum of care.[5]  A medical toll booth simply won\u2019t do the trick.\n\nThe Tangle of Necessary and Unnecessary Care\n\nThe RAND Health Insurance Experiment, the largest and most rigorous study of user fees to date, found that the more patients had to pay for care, the less they used it.[6,7]  Less care led to lower costs, but it didn\u2019t mean greater efficiency, because sometimes people received fewer services when they actually needed more. Patients did reduce their use of less-effective care, but there was a decrease in the use of effective care as well.[7]  The RAND findings also showed that the proportion of inappropriate hospital stays and admissions was the same with or without user fees.[8]\n\nThe RAND findings have stood the test of time. In one study, user fees lowered the appropriate use of effective prevention services and medications to help manage chronic diseases.[4]  User fees have also been shown to reduce inappropriate as well as appropriate antibiotic use to a similar extent.[9]\n\nSavings At Any Cost\n\n\nIn Canada, user fees were introduced in Saskatchewan in the sixties and seventies. Subsequent research found that they reduced the annual use of physician services by almost 6%. Notably, low-income families reduced their use of physician services by about 18%.[10]  Saskatchewan's overall healthcare costs, however, did not go down. Indeed, over the period user fees were levied, physician fees increased and high income earners on average increased their use of physician services.[11]\n\n\nUser fees may also cause some people to forego necessary treatment. In Quebec, for instance, when the elderly and people on welfare had to pay user fees for prescription drugs, they took less medicine and their conditions worsened. **As a result, they ended up with more visits to emergency departments and an increase in serious adverse events.[12]**\n\n\n**A study of seniors insured through U.S. Medicare found that raising user fees for physician visits and prescriptions increased Medicare costs.[13]  As in Quebec, many patients stopped taking their medications and ended up in the hospital.** These findings are supported by a 2007 systematic review of prescription drug cost-sharing.[14] Researchers found that although it is not certain that user fees lead to negative outcomes for all patients, their effect on the chronically ill was clear: increased emergency department use and hospitalizations.[14]\n\nWho Pays the Price\n\n\nThe Canada Health Act effectively bans user fees for two main health services: hospitals and physicians.[15]  There are good reasons for this. User fees shift costs to those that use the system the most: sick people. This amounts to a tax on poverty and age, since the poor and the elderly are less healthy than other groups.[15,16,17,18]\n\n\nThe poor are especially sensitive to these fees, which have led to policies that exempt them from user charges. A 2010 report examining the possibility of a health deductible in Quebec suggested that such an exemption would thwart much of the revenue-generating potential of user fees.[19]  Because healthcare utilization tends to be concentrated among low-income Canadians, low-income exemptions would significantly reduce the proportion of patients paying user fees.[19]\n\n\nThe poor are negatively affected by user fees in other ways, too. A study looking at the effects of prescription drug user fees found that low-income patients were more likely to stop taking medications to treat chronic disease.[20]  These results are not surprising, as in the RAND study adverse health effects due to a decline in care were concentrated among low-income families.[21,7]\n\nUser fees are a blunt instrument for targeting waste. They are aimed exclusively at patients, but patients have very little control over which medical services they use.[11,22]  Patients choose whether or not to visit a doctor, but ongoing care and big-ticket items are ordered by physicians, the \u201cgatekeepers\u201d of the healthcare system.[23,11,22]  What\u2019s more, physician fees account for only 14% of healthcare expenditures.[24]  Patients are not solely responsible for the high costs of healthcare,[3] so it doesn\u2019t make sense to put cost containment on their shoulders.\nConclusion\n\nWhile user fees are effectively banned for hospitals and family physicians in Canada, we continue to have them for many other aspects of healthcare.[25]  \n\nIf our goal is to ensure better use of health services, the evidence shows that user fees have not been capable of achieving it. Finding and eliminating inefficiencies across the continuum of care holds much more promise. The shift toward integrated and coordinated care delivery systems is encouraging, especially where they have been designed to meet the needs of specific populations.[26]  That said, efforts to integrate healthcare services continue to be frustrated by user fees (routinely required for visits to physiotherapists, psychologists and for home care support, etc.) that can create access barriers to the most appropriate services.\nReferences\n\n1.

Its also causing healthcare for the wealthy to decline in quality as a result of the impossibility of maintaining two separate levels of healthcare in a manner that does not expose medical professionals to liability. Perhaps partly because their business model (and the huge waste which our system creates) also creates a situation where the choice for providers of healthcare services is to either go to a situation with segregation just like that in the old South. Lets call that the two waiting room scenario..

I will look at the info later as I have been at the office all day. My conservative nature makes me wonder how health care can be so different from other aspects of our economic behavior regarding cost and choice and ultimate consequences. I have my ideas but am looking forward to reading the link you provided.\n\n Having just read a couple of good books about our ability to make predictions in a complex world- \"Everything is Obvious, Once You Know the Answer\" by Duncan Watts, and \"The Signal and the Noise\" by Nate Silver- I wonder if a two tiered system would be better for an affluent country like the US? We must take care of the poor among us. Seems like the choices made by the poor (whether due to their poverty or not) should not be the \"rate limiting step\" in our health care system design. Why not have two systems compete side by side? We can learn from this arrangement which features of each work the best and which features lead to problems. Anyway...food for thought.

Health care, even under single payer, would be funded by federal income taxes so I have a hard time seeing one crowd out the other. Another counter-argument I would make is that even under the scenario you paint, I wonder how many (and what power they possess) business leaders have the view you have illustrated? Most business in the US is still small business and those leaders do not think on the scale you are talking about. They have kids and grandkids as well and it seems to me they would work to make the current system better rather than turn it over to an untested new system. I see the big picture you are painting, I just have a hard time connecting the individual dots. It would make more sense to me that Conservative minded folks would resist the concentration of power you are granting to big business and would ultimately oppose the scenario you illustrate.\n \nRegarding health care, yes cost is the big problem. Conservatives see single payer as ultimately making costs greater. The more we attempt to insulate the individual from the costs of consuming health care, the more they will consume. In the end, we all pay more and the costs are getting unsustainable. But there still is a very ambiguous link (to the individual) between the choices we make and the associated costs. I am a huge fan of high deductible plans and HSAs. They brought consumer choice back into the equation. They drove better conversations with our doctor regarding the value of certain tests, imaging, etc. Ultimately the best way to lower health care costs is to have a healthier population and a better way to medically manage the end of our lives. Or perhaps technology will rescue us?\n\nAppreciate your intelligent response.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7na0jv", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1356701654", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c7n2qtr", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1430788083, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1356669210, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_15iz8v", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7n4pr9", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1356667745", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c7mvgva", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1430787148, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Why would the \"party of the rich\" declare war on education (they need an educated populace to work for them) and the fortunes of working people (which they need to buy what they are selling)?

That makes the relatively small amount awarded Friday, $21 million, something of a setback for Antigua, which had been struggling to preserve its booming gambling industry. The United States had claimed that its behavior had caused only $500,000 damage to the Antiguan economy.\"\n\n-----\n\nNote how they claimed annual damages *based on the loss of potential, not actual business.*\n\n-----\n\n\"Yet the ruling is significant in that it grants a rare form of compensation: the right of one country, in this case, Antigua, to violate intellectual property laws of another - the United States - by allowing them to distribute copies of American music, movie and software products, among other items.\n\n\"That has only been done once before and is, I believe, a very potent weapon,\" said Mark Mendel, a lawyer representing Antigua, after the ruling. \"I hope that the United States government will now see the wisdom in reaching some accommodation with Antigua over this dispute.\"\n\nThough Antigua is best known for its pristine beaches and tourist attractions, the dozens of online casinos now based there are vital to the island's economy, serving as its second-largest employer.\n\nBy pressing its claim, trade lawyers said, Antigua could set a precedent for other countries to sue the United States for unfair trade practices, potentially opening the door to electronic piracy and other dubious practices around the world.\n\nStill, implementation will prove difficult, the lawyers say.\n\n\"Even if Antigua goes ahead with an act of piracy or the refusal to allow the registration of a trademark, the question still remains of how much that act is worth,\" said Brendan McGivern, a trade lawyer with White &amp; Case in Geneva. \"The Antiguans could say that's worth $50,000, and then the U.S. might say that's worth $5 million - and I can tell you that the U.S. is going to dog them on every step of the way.\"\n\nThe United States has aggressively fought Antigua's claims at every step.\n\nA WTO panel first ruled against the United States in 2004, and its appellate body upheld that decision one year later. In April 2005, the trade body gave the United States one year to comply with its ruling, but that deadline passed with little more than a statement from Washington that it had reviewed its laws and decided it has been in compliance all along.\n\nFrom the start of the case, the United States has claimed that it never intended to allow free, cross-border trade in gambling or betting services. Those activities are restricted in the United States, though some form of gambling is legal in 48 of the country's 50 states.\n\nIn May, the United States announced that *it was rewriting its trade rules to remove gambling services from the jurisdiction of the WTO. Washington has already agreed on deals with the European Union, Canada and Japan to change the treaty but it has yet to reach agreements with a number of other nations, including Antigua.*\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. trade representative issued a stern warning to Antigua to avoid acts of piracy, counterfeiting or violations of intellectual property while negotiations were under way, saying such behavior would \"undermine Antigua's claimed intentions of becoming a leader in legitimate electronic commerce, and would severely discourage foreign investment in the Antiguan economy.\"*\n\n", "id": "t1_c7ne48j", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c7nejik", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "How would you feel having to sue a Hong Kong company, or worse, having a Honk Kong company be immune to any suits over quality of care because of ERISA preemption (more likely)", "id": "t1_c7neo5j", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c7nfa45", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_15iz8v", "selftext": "Well, its usually employers who buy health insurance, and if their primary motivator is to comply with a law, certainly most employers would care if the insurance was very low quality but some would not.

The United States had claimed that its behavior had caused only $500,000 damage to the Antiguan economy.\"\n\n-----\n\nNote how they claimed annual damages *based on the loss of potential, not actual business.*\n\n-----\n\n\"Yet the ruling is significant in that it grants a rare form of compensation: the right of one country, in this case, Antigua, to violate intellectual property laws of another - the United States - by allowing them to distribute copies of American music, movie and software products, among other items.\n\n\"That has only been done once before and is, I believe, a very potent weapon,\" said Mark Mendel, a lawyer representing Antigua, after the ruling. \"I hope that the United States government will now see the wisdom in reaching some accommodation with Antigua over this dispute.\"\n\nThough Antigua is best known for its pristine beaches and tourist attractions, the dozens of online casinos now based there are vital to the island's economy, serving as its second-largest employer.\n\nBy pressing its claim, trade lawyers said, Antigua could set a precedent for other countries to sue the United States for unfair trade practices, potentially opening the door to electronic piracy and other dubious practices around the world.\n\nStill, implementation will prove difficult, the lawyers say.\n\n\"Even if Antigua goes ahead with an act of piracy or the refusal to allow the registration of a trademark, the question still remains of how much that act is worth,\" said Brendan McGivern, a trade lawyer with White &amp; Case in Geneva. \"The Antiguans could say that's worth $50,000, and then the U.S. might say that's worth $5 million - and I can tell you that the U.S. is going to dog them on every step of the way.\"\n\nThe United States has aggressively fought Antigua's claims at every step.\n\nA WTO panel first ruled against the United States in 2004, and its appellate body upheld that decision one year later. In April 2005, the trade body gave the United States one year to comply with its ruling, but that deadline passed with little more than a statement from Washington that it had reviewed its laws and decided it has been in compliance all along.\n\nFrom the start of the case, the United States has claimed that it never intended to allow free, cross-border trade in gambling or betting services. Those activities are restricted in the United States, though some form of gambling is legal in 48 of the country's 50 states.\n\nIn May, the United States announced that *it was rewriting its trade rules to remove gambling services from the jurisdiction of the WTO. Washington has already agreed on deals with the European Union, Canada and Japan to change the treaty but it has yet to reach agreements with a number of other nations, including Antigua.*\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. trade representative issued a stern warning to Antigua to avoid acts of piracy, counterfeiting or violations of intellectual property while negotiations were under way, saying such behavior would \"undermine Antigua's claimed intentions of becoming a leader in legitimate electronic commerce, and would severely discourage foreign investment in the Antiguan economy.\"*\n\n", "id": "t1_c7ne48j", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c7nejik", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "How would you feel having to sue a Hong Kong company, or worse, having a Honk Kong company be immune to any suits over quality of care because of ERISA preemption (more likely)", "id": "t1_c7neo5j", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c7nfa45", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_15iz8v", "selftext": "Well, its usually employers who buy health insurance, and if their primary motivator is to comply with a law, certainly most employers would care if the insurance was very low quality but some would not.

Also, because more than 60% of the cost of healthcare comes from labor, there's no \"economy of scale\" to be gained from a national program as is. It's a prime candidate for localized control with nationally maintained infrastructure (like Denmark and Germany do).\n\nIn truth, the *best* solution is probably a multipayer system (from the left), or something akin to lodge practice (from the right).", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_15iz8v", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7n8l9t", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1356687586", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_15iz8v", "id": "t1_c7nc7yc", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "If you get a chance to check this out, do, I'm pretty sure its all still applicable..\n\n\nhttp://www.citizen.org/documents/PresidentialWTOreport.pdf\n\nWe're very lucky they have not been able to sell across state lines yet, because when they can. then multinationals will enter the market and their \"investment in it\" will trigger the provisions of the WTO treaty that will give them an entitlement to remain here forever, selling insurance, making any structural changes so incredibly expensive that the US would never ever attempt to do so,\n\nPlease read the section on selling across state lines and let me know what you think, it will blow your mind.", "id": "t1_c7ncwqn", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c7ndzfr", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "What do you make of this Antigua and Barbuda situation?\n\nhttp://www.antiguawto.com/\n\nhttp://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds285_e.htm\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/21/business/worldbusiness/21iht-wto.html\n\n\n**They only have the right to regulate things involving trade and business.

That makes the relatively small amount awarded Friday, $21 million, something of a setback for Antigua, which had been struggling to preserve its booming gambling industry. The United States had claimed that its behavior had caused only $500,000 damage to the Antiguan economy.\"\n\n-----\n\nNote how they claimed annual damages *based on the loss of potential, not actual business.*\n\n-----\n\n\"Yet the ruling is significant in that it grants a rare form of compensation: the right of one country, in this case, Antigua, to violate intellectual property laws of another - the United States - by allowing them to distribute copies of American music, movie and software products, among other items.\n\n\"That has only been done once before and is, I believe, a very potent weapon,\" said Mark Mendel, a lawyer representing Antigua, after the ruling. \"I hope that the United States government will now see the wisdom in reaching some accommodation with Antigua over this dispute.\"\n\nThough Antigua is best known for its pristine beaches and tourist attractions, the dozens of online casinos now based there are vital to the island's economy, serving as its second-largest employer.\n\nBy pressing its claim, trade lawyers said, Antigua could set a precedent for other countries to sue the United States for unfair trade practices, potentially opening the door to electronic piracy and other dubious practices around the world.\n\nStill, implementation will prove difficult, the lawyers say.\n\n\"Even if Antigua goes ahead with an act of piracy or the refusal to allow the registration of a trademark, the question still remains of how much that act is worth,\" said Brendan McGivern, a trade lawyer with White &amp; Case in Geneva. \"The Antiguans could say that's worth $50,000, and then the U.S. might say that's worth $5 million - and I can tell you that the U.S. is going to dog them on every step of the way.\"\n\nThe United States has aggressively fought Antigua's claims at every step.\n\nA WTO panel first ruled against the United States in 2004, and its appellate body upheld that decision one year later. In April 2005, the trade body gave the United States one year to comply with its ruling, but that deadline passed with little more than a statement from Washington that it had reviewed its laws and decided it has been in compliance all along.\n\nFrom the start of the case, the United States has claimed that it never intended to allow free, cross-border trade in gambling or betting services. Those activities are restricted in the United States, though some form of gambling is legal in 48 of the country's 50 states.\n\nIn May, the United States announced that *it was rewriting its trade rules to remove gambling services from the jurisdiction of the WTO. Washington has already agreed on deals with the European Union, Canada and Japan to change the treaty but it has yet to reach agreements with a number of other nations, including Antigua.*\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. trade representative issued a stern warning to Antigua to avoid acts of piracy, counterfeiting or violations of intellectual property while negotiations were under way, saying such behavior would \"undermine Antigua's claimed intentions of becoming a leader in legitimate electronic commerce, and would severely discourage foreign investment in the Antiguan economy.\"*\n\n", "id": "t1_c7ne48j", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c7nejik", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "How would you feel having to sue a Hong Kong company, or worse, having a Honk Kong company be immune to any suits over quality of care because of ERISA preemption (more likely)", "id": "t1_c7neo5j", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c7nfa45", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_15iz8v", "selftext": "Well, its usually employers who buy health insurance, and if their primary motivator is to comply with a law, certainly most employers would care if the insurance was very low quality but some would not.

You can buy an inexpensive Linux computer called a Raspberry Pi for only $35, which will work with any TV that has an HDMI input. (Raspbian is Debian Linux for the Raspberry Pi) \n\n Many jobs now, especially jobs that don't involve computers, are dead end jobs and the wages are not rising.\n\nThe ticket to good jobs is a solid knowledge of MATH and SCIENCE, and unfortunately, now also lots of good luck. Its not enough to just know how to read and write and do arithmetic and spell decently and speak without an obvious problem. \n\nNot long ago that was enough. \n\nKnowing how to use a computer is like reading used to be, its a crucial skill.", "id": "t1_c7l6aje", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_15bblk", "id": "t1_c7l7p40", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "SkarlathAmon", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "What job? They wont get a job. You are thinking like a middle class person with a college degree. They wont get their feet in the door without being REALLY good at something. Not just knowing it. \n\nSimply knowing Windows is not going to get them a job any more, ever, and also even if it could, por people live on next to nothing. They cannot afford windows, because all the software costs money. They don't have it, they are not going to win at that game. They will get sucked into useless, time wasting things that have no value to them in terms of career advancement. Its not unlikely that all that time will be wasted.\n\nLinux is free. And Linux jobs are growing. Linux is the operating system used by many scientists.\n\nWindows makes sense for some situations. I just think that poor people would be better served in terms of a long term career if they really devoted a lot of energy to learning Linux and then learning open source applications like, for example, PostgreSQL. They would be a far more valuable find to an employer if they knew, for example, how to set up and maintain the company's IT assets, using PostgreSQL and some middleware like PHP, than if they knew how to do Word and Excel.\n\nApplications for which a demand exists, for example, SQL expertise, that skill is in demand in business on a higher level than simple windows expertise, and it could get somebody out of poverty.\n\nThe one thing poor people often have is time. What I am suggesting is that they try to use it wisely. Linux and open source is an incredible world where what you know and how well you know it matters more than almost anywhere else. Nobody cares what your background is if you know your stuff. People have done this, people use open source as a route out of poverty. Its not a pipe dream - the chance of success is higher than in a lot of other careers.\n\nAlso, learning electronics.. That is a useful skill.

{"domain": "self.Ask_Politics", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a few questions about the cap on Out of Pocket Costs. (See &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PPACA_Premium_Chart.jpg\"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PPACA_Premium_Chart.jpg&lt;/a&gt; for an image of the values for people up to 400% FPL)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.) Who pays for the difference between the costs and the cap value? Does that money come from the federal government or the states and how is it appropriated? (Will it be subjected to a new battle over appropriations every year.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2.) Assuming (from the chart) that the cap on Out of Pocket Costs is 9.5% of a family&amp;#39;s income for somebody with a income 399% of the Federal Poverty Line, what is the Out of Pocket Cost Maximum for somebody earning 401% of the Federal Poverty Line? (is it still 9.5%, is it capped at any other level, or is there no cap ?) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Often when people have chronic illnesses or when they are suddenly diagnosed with a serious illness, out of pocket costs can be unexpectedly high even for people with excellent insurance. Generally, the less comprehensive the insurance is, the higher the uncovered costs. Paradoxically, those with the lowest ability to buy &amp;quot;gold plated&amp;quot; plans (sick people) often have the biggest need for the better kinds of insurance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently, many (state) programs supply so called &amp;quot;high risk pool&amp;quot; insurance to people who have health problems when they are not able to get into a high quality group plan. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that insurance tends to be way too expensive for many people who need it. In other states the cost is lower, but there are waiting lists or in some cases, even lotteries to get into the programs. (Generally the high risk pools lose money.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other states don&amp;#39;t offer such programs at all. The people who cannot access any kind of insurance now are the people who seem to be in danger of falling through the cracks of the ACA as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many currently cannot buy insurance at any cost- and although they will in theory be able to buy it under the ACA, (or be exempted if the cost is too high, remaining uninsured.) its debatable whether they will be able to afford to be insured without a cap on OOP costs, even if they are making higher incomes than the 400%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chronically ill people are the ones who are the group of people who often these programs are most needed to help, their need for insurance is the big weakness of the American system, (which was rated in one recent study to be the worst developed country in the world to become chronically ill in.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If this weakness exists for this crucial group, and the ACA is trying to obscure this failing without trying to address it for the people who currently are uninsured - that is fundamentally dishonest. It begs the question, what exactly is the ACA intended to do then, if it fails in what many healthcare experts described as what should have been our primary mission.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My worry is many folk who have chronic conditions will find that they have no choice but to remain uninsured under the ACA because the combination of high uncovered costs and high premiums will continue to be be too much for them. The cap on OOP costs is potentially a very valuable benefit for some people, one they will really need, because otherwise, the OOP costs in some lower costs plans can exceed income - currently in many plans, there is no limit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The test will be I think if families with a child or self-employed wage earner who gets hit with a major illness - perhaps they&amp;#39;ve bought a family plan partially subsidized by the ACA when they are in the 2nd quintile and have the cap, then one year they earn enough to put them into the 3rd or 4th quintiles of income - can remain insured and remain able to afford the OOP costs - even if the illness is a serious one..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, quality of care is a major concern.

(See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PPACA_Premium_Chart.jpg for an image of the values for people up to 400% FPL)\n\n1.) Who pays for the difference between the costs and the cap value? Does that money come from the federal government or the states and how is it appropriated? (Will it be subjected to a new battle over appropriations every year.)\n\n2.) Assuming (from the chart) that the cap on Out of Pocket Costs is 9.5% of a family's income for somebody with a income 399% of the Federal Poverty Line, what is the Out of Pocket Cost Maximum for somebody earning 401% of the Federal Poverty Line? (is it still 9.5%, is it capped at any other level, or is there no cap ?) \n\nOften when people have chronic illnesses or when they are suddenly diagnosed with a serious illness, out of pocket costs can be unexpectedly high even for people with excellent insurance. Generally, the less comprehensive the insurance is, the higher the uncovered costs. Paradoxically, those with the lowest ability to buy \"gold plated\" plans (sick people) often have the biggest need for the better kinds of insurance. \n\nCurrently, many (state) programs supply so called \"high risk pool\" insurance to people who have health problems when they are not able to get into a high quality group plan. \n\nBut that insurance tends to be way too expensive for many people who need it. In other states the cost is lower, but there are waiting lists or in some cases, even lotteries to get into the programs. (Generally the high risk pools lose money.) \n\nOther states don't offer such programs at all. The people who cannot access any kind of insurance now are the people who seem to be in danger of falling through the cracks of the ACA as well. \n\nMany currently cannot buy insurance at any cost- and although they will in theory be able to buy it under the ACA, (or be exempted if the cost is too high, remaining uninsured.) its debatable whether they will be able to afford to be insured without a cap on OOP costs, even if they are making higher incomes than the 400%\n\nChronically ill people are the ones who are the group of people who often these programs are most needed to help, their need for insurance is the big weakness of the American system, (which was rated in one recent study to be the worst developed country in the world to become chronically ill in.) \n\nIf this weakness exists for this crucial group, and the ACA is trying to obscure this failing without trying to address it for the people who currently are uninsured - that is fundamentally dishonest. It begs the question, what exactly is the ACA intended to do then, if it fails in what many healthcare experts described as what should have been our primary mission.\n\nMy worry is many folk who have chronic conditions will find that they have no choice but to remain uninsured under the ACA because the combination of high uncovered costs and high premiums will continue to be be too much for them. The cap on OOP costs is potentially a very valuable benefit for some people, one they will really need, because otherwise, the OOP costs in some lower costs plans can exceed income - currently in many plans, there is no limit.\n\nThe test will be I think if families with a child or self-employed wage earner who gets hit with a major illness - perhaps they've bought a family plan partially subsidized by the ACA when they are in the 2nd quintile and have the cap, then one year they earn enough to put them into the 3rd or 4th quintiles of income - can remain insured and remain able to afford the OOP costs - even if the illness is a serious one..\n\nAlso, quality of care is a major concern. Currently, aghast at gag clauses and restrictions on the treatments they give by HMOs many of the better doctors are dropping out of the insurance system. It will be a serious problem if our healthcare system for those who most need it is limited to being accepted by only a few doctors. In Canada, and almost every other developed country, all doctors are \"in network\"\n\n\n(Note: This is a re-phrasing of the question to make it more readable)\n---\nResources:\n\nHere is the source of the data for the chart above\nhttp://bingaman.senate.gov/policy/crs_privhins.pdf\n \nMassachusetts Experience: When The Full Sticker Shock Of Health Coverage Hits Our Family\nhttp://commonhealth.wbur.org/2012/11/sticker-shock-health-insurance\n\nPatients experiences under Massachusetts Health Reform\nhttp://www.citizen.org/hrg/article_redirect.cfm?ID=18399\n\nPNHP Research (comparing different ways of paying for health care)\n\nhttp://www.pnhp.org/resources/pnhp-research-the-case-for-a-national-health-program\n\nSick Around The World | FRONTLINE | PBS (compares several nations healthcare systems)\n\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/sickaroundtheworld/\n\nChart of Health Care Spending Per Capita comparison\n\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Total_health_expenditure_per_capita%2C_US_Dollars_PPP.png", "likes": null, "link_flair_text": null, "children": [], "clicked": false, "title": "A question on the Affordable Care Act's 9.5 cap on Out of Pocket Costs.

As long as we keep that waste, we wont be able to afford healthcare for everybody. As soon as we buy healthcare services as a nation, rather than as individuals, we will save around a third, because our current system is the most expensive in the world because its the most needlessly complicated system in the world..and that change in and of itself makes it possible to pay for it out of taxes and eliminate bills to the end users, the patients.

Or does the government pay it, if so, when, is it a rebate they get at the tax day, (not good because to stay insured they will have to come up with a lot of cash that they would often not have between the day the cost went up and when they received the tax rebate)\n\nAnd so on.", "id": "t1_c7lmu9w", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c7lmd8f", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430762144, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7lmu9w", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1356384149", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "urnbabyurn", "id": "t1_c7lmd8f", "parent_id": "t1_c7llnnq", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1435654727, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7lmd8f", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1356382078", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "parent_id": "t1_c7ll9fv", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430761563, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1356379412, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7llnnq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1356379005", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1569ze", "selftext": "Do you understand what I mean when I say that there could be a huge jump in costs to people that resulted from only a tiny jump in income?", "id": "t1_c7lndsy", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1569ze", "selftext": "The problem is that neither of us know what insurance will cost these families.

I would not cut it to an unreasionable level but I would cut it to much less than it is today, by cutting speculative programs that were scientifically questionable. I would put most of that money into education and lifelong learning. (So people could continue to be employed into the future, otherwise in ten or fifteen years we will almost certainly have huge levels of unemployment.

I would eliminate our current way of paying for healthcare and would look at countries like Canada, France, the UK, Sweden, Taiwan, Australia, and other countries that spend much less but get much better healthcare quality and I would try to emulate them, I would get rid of our system of private insurance and I would make healthcare free to the end user, which would save a lot of money on admin costs.

This is an inspection on the appropriate role for government as it pertains to wealth and lifestyle. \n\nConsider that over time, a week's labor buys a higher and higher standard of living (over the course of hundreds of years, not necessarily the last decade).  We are so wealthy that we fulfill our base dietary needs in just a few hours of work.   Shelter is a bit trickier to measure as a function of work because our living standards, compared to roman times, have sky rocketed.  In America, we have hot and cold running potable water, electricity in every room, central air, and hundreds if square feet per person.\n\nThe question quickly becomes - why do we continue to work 40-50 hours a week?   If the first 8-16 hours work can pay for all our 19th century needs, is it really necessary to indulge in lifestyle advancement?   \n\nSadly, this is no longer a choice we can make as individuals.  Our culture values lifestyle and wealth so much that we have formed government mechanisms to force folks into a high standard of living that effectively mandates long work weeks.  For example, building codes set minimum square footage requirements for housing.  Local butchers are the things of the past in part because the FDA requires a full time inspector to be present for slaughter.  \n\nEverything our government does is a reflection of what we do to ourselves, though.  We place a high value on status symbols.   The American lust for automobiles placed them in nearly every household, which in turn lead to urban planning that assumed their use.  Then, the design of bedroom communities made a car a near requirement.   Our federal government keeps the costs of new cars high, in part through thousands of dollars in mandated safety equipment and emissions capabilities.\n\nIn some parts of the country, we're forced to water our lawns at the expense of hundreds of dollars a month.  We're not permitted to gather rainwater, nor can we burn cheap wood for heat or raise hens or goats.  Folks cannot engage in simple trade craft with our fellow citizens without onerous permits, tax collection, employment regulation, liability insurance, tax preparation, and the slew of professional services and frictional costs each beurocratic system incurs (lawyers, tax accountants, registration fees, etc.).  Should I really have to break multiple laws to pay my neighbor to mow my lawn - should I have to risk losing everything I've worked for if he injures himself in the process?\n\nIf only we were permitted the freedom to chose to live a 19th century lifestyle, then perhaps we would have the choice to be able to work 8 or 16 hours a week.  I support the tiny house movement because it attempts to make this feasible in an environmentally sound way.   I would love if our government offered more support of such movements, and perhaps applied similar ideals in the persuit of economic woes on fronts other than housing.   For example, working less than 32 hours a week does not afford you the same protections as full time employees in many states.   Transportation costs are held too high.   Local governments actively discourage gardening, and outright ban small livestock for most American households.\n\nPerhaps it's time to reject further demands for mandated lifestyle standards and safety in favor of more options that don't require long work weeks.  We're definitely wealthy enough as a society to make some more critical decisions about how we spend our time and resources.  I see no reason that an 8 hour work week shouldn't allow a basic standard of living, if we can change our consumer-oriented culture and the consequent government it supports.\n", "edited": 1356290529, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_152fo9", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7kz6d2", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1356257100", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Very well put, I thank you for your unique insight.

I'm refering to times when humans lead a  nomadic life, and permanent settlements of over a few dozen people were not feasible.  The \"problem,\"  in short, was that everyone was so busy scraping out nutritional calories from nature, that the population could not spare anyone's time to stop hunting or gathering to focus on more specialized trade craft - At least according to this theory.\n\nThe technology of demesticated species (crops and livestock) and food preservation (fermenting in particular) radically changed this.   The sheep shepards of early agricultural societies could provide entire settlements with meat, freeing up others' time to discover and dedicate to math, medicine, sciences, religion, and the humanities.   This was widely considered to be a good idea.\n\nThese types of technological changes have happened several times in the last 5 thousand years.   I would argue that the most significant changes, in terms of scale of automation and the resulting ability for society to develop  specialized skills, are already behind us.  So we have nothing fundamental to fear here.   Modern societies now need but one farmer to provide the food for tens of thousands of fellow citizens.  This ratio is less widely accepted as a good thing, but it's nonetheless amazing that we collectively still find work that puts food in our mouths and increases our standards of living well above that of even a Roman Emporer!\n\nPopulations have expanded at incredible rates, but we still have found or created productive work for over 90 percent of the population (in the case of the US,) through the capitalistic profit motive.   I see no barriers coming that can't also be overcome through the natural self interest of the amazing intellect and passion of human beings.  In other words, I don't see this as a new problem for government to fix.\n\nIn conclusion, this should not be thought of as a zero sum game.   There is not a fixed amount of work to be done in the world.   By freeing up folks from the more fundamental tasks (e.g. Food production, energy, industrial production, transportation), humanity fills the void.  (e.g. Sciences, arts)   Just look at the sheer size of the entertainment industry today.   While we tend to stick our noses up at pop music and infotainment, never before has such a huge percentage of human creative effort - and hard earned wages - gone into the \"art\" category.   Art is no longer the exclusive playground of aristocracy.  Art has been elevated in importance to be the central focus of society, contrary to our tendencies to idealize the 16th and 17th centuries as the golden age for art.  I'm not just refering to paintings, sculpture, and dance; think of the focus on video games, movies, music, fashion, and sports in the lives of everyday citizens.\n\nWe will continue to get wealthier as a people as this technological progress continues.\n\nP.S. - credit to the late Douglas Adams for the paraphrased quote \"this was widely considered to be a good idea\"", "edited": 1356255005, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_152fo9", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7kyju1", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1356251413", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "clicked": false, "title": "What do people think we, as Americans should do about this important issue which is not getting the discussion it needs, that effects all of us a lot- The social changes triggered by rapid increases in computing technology in the workplace- workplace automation?", "media": null, "base10id": 68977881, "id": "t3_152fo9", "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 3, "saved": false, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/Ask_Politics/comments/152fo9/what_do_people_think_we_as_americans_should_do/", "name": "t3_152fo9", "created": 1355860919, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/152fo9/what_do_people_think_we_as_americans_should_do/", "author_flair_text": null, "author": "christ0ph", "created_utc": 1355860919, "distinguished": null, "num_comments": 14, "num_reports": null, "ups": 9}
