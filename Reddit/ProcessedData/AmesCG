{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1uu5to", "selftext": "Some of you guys are getting this wrong. I'll endeavor to correct:\n\nYou may not be aware that Lords is no longer entirely hereditary; it's part appointment-based. For example, Margaret Thatcher sat in Lords until her death. In fact, an appointment to Lords is a common way to honor a retired MP, or get a problematic MP out of the way. As such, the only permanent change in the structure of government following this hypothetical tragedy would be, Lords would be entirely appointment-based. Depending on how you view things, that might make it a better institution. (Appointed members are often very active in advising the Government and Commons on legislative initiatives, for example, while hereditary members are often less....... engaged.)\n\nFurthermore, though Lords is an integral part of government, it's not really a \"massive part of the English political system\" any longer. Remember that the Parliament Acts restrain Lords' ability to stall legislation, may not originate certain bills, and need not be consulted on some matters altogether. Lords factors into the system very rarely, then, and only in specific situations. Its importance is especially diminished since the UK Supreme Court came into being. \n\nAs an example of Lords' real effect on policy, consider the [fox-hunting ban debate](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1846577.stm). After a \"ping-pong\" session in which the bill was passed between Commons and Lords, Commons finally invoked the Parliament Act to cut Lords out of the process altogether. Note, though, that it is **extraordinarily rare** for the Parliament Act to have to be invoked. Most of the time, Lords just sort of, ahem, \"minds its place.\"\n\nSo what I'm getting at is, the loss of all sitting Lords would be a tragedy for the remaining hereditary Peers, and for the nation, in that I imagine this could only happen through a terrorist attack. But it wouldn't be an insurmountable barrier to government. \n\n**Source:** Interned for an MP (Commons), worked with Lords on some legislation.\n\n**TLDR:** The loss of Lords would be a tragedy for the nation, but impact the long-term functioning of government in only minor ways.

In connection with the sale of stock, for example, a CFO's published statements may be subject to SEC regulation. As a leader of a publicly traded company, you can't falsely claim that you're going to beat earnings, because that would be stock manipulation. And, a chemist selling a new medicine may find his claims about the medicine subject to FDA regulation. As a chemist, you can't represent that your placebo cures cancer when in fact it does nothing. \n\nIn both cases, the actor's speech is regulated, such that his First Amendment rights are, in a sense, limited. This is permissible, though, because the First Amendment values commercial speech less than political speech. A simple brightline rule is, commercial speech that is false or misleading can be regulated; political speech that is false or misleading cannot be. \n\nFor a case examining the difference, and why this results, consider [**Virginia State Pharmacy Board v.

Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties.\n\nSo, Thomas Jefferson, too, believed that \"separation of church and state\" was a constitutional bedrock principle, and that is basis was the Establishment Clause.

For sure? \n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that, for an average American living an average life, warrantless wiretapping certainly violates your Fourth Amendment rights.

I'm not just saying that because I used to work there :)\n\nNow the task of finding the controlling rationale in *NFIB* v. *Sebelius* is, however, not terribly hard, because the liberal bloc also joined Roberts in saying that the individual mandate was also proper under the taxing power. (I think you missed this fact, which is understandable.) That means there's 5 votes to uphold the mandate as a taxing power, and 5 votes *against* upholding it as a Commerce Clause power. Here, the taxing rationale controls. \n\nAs to the marriage case, let's assume your hunch is correct, and Kennedy supplies a fifth vote for invalidating DoMA, but does NOT concur in the liberal bloc's Fourteenth Amendment opinion, even in part. In that case, the precedential value of the decision will depend upon the case, and the federal circuit in which the decision is raised. But there is authority to suggest that Kennedy's hypothetical one-vote Tenth Amendment rationale would control. \n\n**Edit to add tl;dr --** in a plurality opinion, the narrowest rationale to command a majority controls. Therefore, correctly interpreting the *Sebelius* case, the tax rationale controls. In a hypothetical 4/1 split on *why* DoMA is unconstitutional, it is possible that the single-vote majority decision could control. Though it would depend.

I would like to add to the discussion a wonderfully curious case by the name of *Apodaca v. Oregon* (1972). It is a study in split opinions, as the final opinions of the Court are paradoxical. The issue was whether juries in state criminal trials had to be unanimous to convict. \n\nFour justices (Group A) said that state juries and federal juries had to have the same requirements for conviction, and that requirement was unanimity. \n\nFour different justices (Group B) that state juries and federal juries had to have the same requirements for conviction, and that requirement was no unanimity needed.\n\nOne justice, Justice Powell, said that state and federal juries were different species, and were not held to the same requirements. Federal juries had to be unanimous, but state juries need not be.\n\nThe split opinion left a lot of questions. Apodaca's non-unanimous conviction was upheld, because 5 justices (Powell + Group B) said that state juries need not be unanimous to convict. However, this rule of law actually contradicted the majority opinion of the Court, because 8 justices (Group A + Group B) said that state and federal juries had to be held to the same standard!\n\nThe reason the law that state juries can convict on less than unanimous verdicts is because the majority opinion requiring state and federal similarity was what is called dicta. Dicta is when a court says something in an opinion that is not directly relevant to the narrowest possible construction of the holding. Dicta does not carry precedential power, although it does indicate a judge's likelihood to vote one way or another in the future, and maybe carry persuasive power in future arguments.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1egf31", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ca085of", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1368744923", "ups": 5, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1egf31", "id": "t1_ca0eqec", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "PKMKII", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_ca00xyp", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431129777, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;Where are you getting your information on Kennedy?

There's also a difference between being out of the recession and having a strong enough economy to start paying back your debt without derailing it. Reasonable economists disagree about whether we are out of the woods yet, and if so at what point that happened. \n\n&gt;you cut back spending, increase taxes and pay off the debt you incurred\n\nI think that you have take into account the fact that the GOP refuses to consider any substantial tax increase (or lately, any increase of any kind whatsoever, including by closing loopholes).

So there was no forced decision between austerity or default like the one Europe is facing. That was a false dilemma created by the GOP for political reasons. \n\nMy point about austerity is simply that the countries that try it find that it depresses their economy.

So the increase is higher if your income bracket is higher, and lower if it's lower, like our current tax brackets are structured.

Obama has tried to compromise again and again. He's actually offered plans that are nearly identical to ones that the *Republicans themselves proposed* just a year or two earlier, and been shut down. \n\nI'm no Obama worshipper, but he's not the problem here.

Obama's $1.273 trillion; 507% of Bush's.\n\nLets exclude 2008 and 2009 as those were extraordinary years.  In that case, Bush's On-Budget deficit was $389 billion.  Obama's $1.295 trillion - 332% of Bush's.  Total deficit would be $221 billion for Bush; $1.226 trillion for Obama.  555% of Bush's.\n\nHeck, lets give Bush 2009 *and* 2009.  It gets a bit closer: On budget of $546 billion to $1.29 trillion.

There are legitimate reasons for keeping something that will not be perpetual off the budget - baseline budgeting.  Obama can claim he \"cut the deficit\" by ending the wars.

Was that due to stimulus or was it just the economy finally starting to grow on its own?  There's really no way to know - you can claim on things, but then others can compare to coming out of other recessions.  It seems this one is an L-shaped recession, given we're not getting \"catch-up\" growth.\n\n&gt;BTW, the reasoning Obama defenders give is that temporary deficit spending during a recession is a good thing to jump start a flailing economy, and the temporary spending is over a roughly 10 year period (I could be mistaken).

As of this time, there has been nothing of substantial merit that has been provided that contradicts the assessment that what happened in the aftermath of Benghazi was completely bungled by the administration. Or put another way, there is nothing to suggest that malice is a better assessment than incompetence. \n\nAs for the whistleblower blow-back. That is a very valid point of inquiry and really should be investigated more. If Hicks truly was targeted for trying to reveal the truth, then he deserves to be vindicated. However, that again does not imply malice to deceive the american public and more likely implies that a Chief of Staff was furious that someone went behind their back and undermined the authority of their department (which is really what Hicks was doing). It is more plausible to say that the chief of staff was more personally pissed at Hicks then she was receiving orders from on high to punish Hicks. \n\nObama's problem is that he is not exceedingly transparent in these matters and when met with such a hostile market against him, such acts of incompetence are always met with accusations of malice. Rather than weaken his office further by explicating the depth of the errors that are made by his office. This does not imply a criminal cover-up in any sense, but rather a fairly normal operation of any large institution. Essentially, everything about his administration is manipulated, twisted, and used against his administration, that the only way to even maintain a semblance of order is to maintain a strong administration.

It was constructed in 2009 in accordance with security standards established by the Diplomatic Security Service at the State Department. The building in Benghazi was basically a villa that was being rented to serve as a temporary consulate. So it was built in accordance with your normal residential security standards for Libya. It was not made to withstand rocket or bomb attacks. So it was not a very secure facility at all.\n\nYou throw 150 guys at a civilian residence, with rockets, grenades, and what not, and it is very likely that someone is going to get killed. What should be noted is the testament to our own security forces that only 4 were killed. \n\nThe truly legitimate questions that should be asked are why weren't troops sent in earlier (mind you they were sent in) and what was the break-down in security that led to missed warning, which there were a few. \n\nTo argue this was preventable is to argue with hindsight and ignore the legitimate difficulties in securing our diplomatic objectives across the globe. There are threats that come in every day, and it is a nightmare of a task deciding what is a credible threat and what is not. \n\nThis was a major failing of the Obama administration on security, one that I am fairly certain was met with rage by the administration internally and one that is being dealt with to fix these issues moving forward. \n\nBut lets not also forget that there were 50+ attacks on our embassies and diplomatic missions under Bush, and we never saw such controversy. And we know for certain that he lied to the American people to get us into war. Those lies are documented.  So when you act like some how Obama is getting a slide by the media please remember the following:\n* News Corp. is the largest media producer in the country when talking about news. Its products reach more consumers than any of the other media outlets. It is not only a part of the MSM, it by definition is the main stream. \n* Obama has been slammed since before he was president by their products, and has not had a day in the 4yrs, 100 days that hes been president, where he wasn't \"utterly destroyed\" by News Corp products.\n* Bush and Cheney, while investigated to some extent, have not had to suffer the same vitriol of congress and the MSM for their actions which led to over 200K people being killed, many who had done no wrong to warrant death by America. \n\nThis idea that somehow Obama has gotten off free about Benghazi is a propaganda'ed mess and is nothing but a fallacy.

Is it not possible then that the information that the administration was using was the one they believed to be true at the time while also looking into the case of an attack which those initial reports indicated?\n\nThe reason I ask this is because this sounds like a classic case of the Texas sharpshooter fallacy in reasoning. The reports that are still at the front of everyone's minds are those that confirm the truth now, but as was stated over and over in the investigation there were numerous raw reports coming from multiple sources. Had the flip case happened (reports of terror turned out to be wrong, but the admin said it was terror.) Would we also be upset at them? \n\nSomething to note is that this administration has fairly consistently been shy from using terrorist rhetoric about situations that aren't fully investigated, or ascribing such heated value judgments when dealing with foreign security investigations. \n\nThe only issue I have with this whole \"controversy\" is that I, and many, don't get what the issue is that the administration believed it was one thing and found it to be another thing. I don't see that there was a cover-up (and even if there initially was, I'm not sure if there is much controversy in that), but rather an investigation that took place that required time to define fully. \n\nI think that we have to remember the administration is made of humans, and that people who are deliberative and investigative don't necessarily accurate information initially. In the rush for information they made a mistake, they have admitted this mistake, and most of the country has recognized this and moved on. \n\nIn conclusion, I can absolutely come to a conclusion that there is no necessity in your analysis that ascribes malice to the action of the administration.

By \"one founding father,\" are you talking about Patrick Henry, George Mason, Samuel Adams, John Adams, Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, or someone I did not name?\n\nYes, as in the context of the federalist papers, #46 was the only one in which James Madison expressed concern about government tyranny through taking away arms.\n\n&gt;There is a mechanism within the charter to do this. It's the amendment process. It's hard, and that's on purpose. Because it's very serious business. But you don't just get to brush the Constitution off. And right now, it says \"shall not be infringed.\"\n\nYou are right, but as it stands right now, Republican politicians have their heads so far up their asses, absolutely nothing can get done. It's pointless to even try at the moment, all you do is waste time and gain theater points. I'm not saying we should brush the Constitution aside, but with the kind of deadlock we have right now, people are looking for legal solutions that don't involve a Congress being lobbied by special interests like the NRA and ALEC. No one is saying take all the guns away, I know for sure that will not solve the problem. But we have to give a definition to what \"arms\" include because that is a very broad label.\n\n&gt;So if you want to stop violence, if you want to stop people getting shot, address the actual problem. You bring me a gun control proposal that starts with de-escalating the militarization of police, and I'll at least hear you out. Until then you're just pissing in the wind.\n\nYes, you are right about cops. The expectations of law enforcement needs to be raised. I'm black, I grew up in bad neighborhood on the south side of LA. I know better then most how bad cops can be. Cops need to be better trained and better educated as well as tightening regulations and increasing transparency. But again we are talking about a special interest group, a highly conservative one at that, the same conservatives that vote for the asses in the Congress that give favors to the Police unions. With that being said, Los Angeles is now one of the safest metropolitan areas in the US, and a lot of it is the very large increase in police numbers. In my opinion, law enforcement officers should serve in a more samaritan capacity, shooting your firearm should be a last resort in conflict resolution.\n\nOn a side note, did you know that the only reason the military cannot be used in a law enforcement capacity within the US is because southern politicians wanted the army to not be there to enforce anti-discrimination laws. Pretty interesting huh?\n\nIn addition, I would like to see a federal office that treats firearms like automobiles; \nregistry\ninsurance\na license for each class of gun \na vigorous mandatory training course focusing on how to safely store the weapon away from children and when it is appropriate to use firearms and outlining non-lethal resolution methods.\nStop the block on the CDC's research on gun violence.\nPay more attention to mental health and increase awareness of it.\nRegulate arms manufacturers so no more stock goes up \"missing.\"\n\nMost of the gun related deaths in this country occur because of accidental firing and crimes of passion, you can't say that we can ignore this any longer.\n\nGuns are tools, but they are being used in the wrong way. Instead of a tool for hunting or hobby, in a lot of cases, they are used as tools to dominate and intimidate. This isn't right, no one should have to fear for their life or be afraid while just walking down the street.\n\n&gt;What the fuck. It already happened. You can be disappeared in this country. No trial, no nothin', one day you're there, the next day you're just gone, and it's perfectly legal. The President can order your murder by fiat using flying death robots.

This isn't 1984, it's 2013, and we're gonna be at war with Eurasia for a mighty long time. We are already there. It happened and we did nothing.\n\nI said it was more *Brave New World* then *1984*, books written very long ago that have frightening similarities to the present. Yes, government power needs to be reigned in, the UAMF needs to be revoked and the Patriot Act needs to disappear. Yes, you are right, we collectively let it happen because we bought into hyperbole and dogmatic ideology. We've let corporations and the wealthiest gain significant power over our elected officials. It is terrible and I hate it, but most people do not give a shit. They are too busy working and scraping by to worry about long term power grabs of the rich and powerful.\n\nBut, there is absolutely no chance of large scale war right now, I will explain it if you wish to continue this but I need a break, my fingers are tired.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18xiy7", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8k0t3v", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361576891", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "buffalo_pete", "id": "t1_c8jre3j", "parent_id": "t1_c8jffmq", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431373385, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18xiy7", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8jre3j", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361548535", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "IBStallion", "id": "t1_c8jffmq", "parent_id": "t1_c8j60uf", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431367709, "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's not a matter of belief, I'm aware of the existence and validity of the passage in question. \n\nIt also involves the second amendment interpretation provided dealing with government tyranny.

Unless you're black, in which case you're more likely to be shot by a police officer than *everyone else combined.* You hear the talking point all the time about how homicide's the leading cause of death among young black males? *Cops* are the leading cause of death among young black males.\n\nSo if you want to stop violence, if you want to stop people getting shot, address the actual problem.

By \"one founding father,\" are you talking about Patrick Henry, George Mason, Samuel Adams, John Adams, Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, or someone I did not name?\n\nYes, as in the context of the federalist papers, #46 was the only one in which James Madison expressed concern about government tyranny through taking away arms.\n\n&gt;There is a mechanism within the charter to do this. It's the amendment process. It's hard, and that's on purpose. Because it's very serious business. But you don't just get to brush the Constitution off. And right now, it says \"shall not be infringed.\"\n\nYou are right, but as it stands right now, Republican politicians have their heads so far up their asses, absolutely nothing can get done. It's pointless to even try at the moment, all you do is waste time and gain theater points. I'm not saying we should brush the Constitution aside, but with the kind of deadlock we have right now, people are looking for legal solutions that don't involve a Congress being lobbied by special interests like the NRA and ALEC. No one is saying take all the guns away, I know for sure that will not solve the problem. But we have to give a definition to what \"arms\" include because that is a very broad label.\n\n&gt;So if you want to stop violence, if you want to stop people getting shot, address the actual problem. You bring me a gun control proposal that starts with de-escalating the militarization of police, and I'll at least hear you out. Until then you're just pissing in the wind.\n\nYes, you are right about cops. The expectations of law enforcement needs to be raised. I'm black, I grew up in bad neighborhood on the south side of LA. I know better then most how bad cops can be. Cops need to be better trained and better educated as well as tightening regulations and increasing transparency. But again we are talking about a special interest group, a highly conservative one at that, the same conservatives that vote for the asses in the Congress that give favors to the Police unions. With that being said, Los Angeles is now one of the safest metropolitan areas in the US, and a lot of it is the very large increase in police numbers. In my opinion, law enforcement officers should serve in a more samaritan capacity, shooting your firearm should be a last resort in conflict resolution.\n\nOn a side note, did you know that the only reason the military cannot be used in a law enforcement capacity within the US is because southern politicians wanted the army to not be there to enforce anti-discrimination laws. Pretty interesting huh?\n\nIn addition, I would like to see a federal office that treats firearms like automobiles; \nregistry\ninsurance\na license for each class of gun \na vigorous mandatory training course focusing on how to safely store the weapon away from children and when it is appropriate to use firearms and outlining non-lethal resolution methods.\nStop the block on the CDC's research on gun violence.\nPay more attention to mental health and increase awareness of it.\nRegulate arms manufacturers so no more stock goes up \"missing.\"\n\nMost of the gun related deaths in this country occur because of accidental firing and crimes of passion, you can't say that we can ignore this any longer.\n\nGuns are tools, but they are being used in the wrong way. Instead of a tool for hunting or hobby, in a lot of cases, they are used as tools to dominate and intimidate. This isn't right, no one should have to fear for their life or be afraid while just walking down the street.\n\n&gt;What the fuck. It already happened. You can be disappeared in this country. No trial, no nothin', one day you're there, the next day you're just gone, and it's perfectly legal. The President can order your murder by fiat using flying death robots.

This isn't 1984, it's 2013, and we're gonna be at war with Eurasia for a mighty long time. We are already there. It happened and we did nothing.\n\nI said it was more *Brave New World* then *1984*, books written very long ago that have frightening similarities to the present. Yes, government power needs to be reigned in, the UAMF needs to be revoked and the Patriot Act needs to disappear. Yes, you are right, we collectively let it happen because we bought into hyperbole and dogmatic ideology. We've let corporations and the wealthiest gain significant power over our elected officials. It is terrible and I hate it, but most people do not give a shit. They are too busy working and scraping by to worry about long term power grabs of the rich and powerful.\n\nBut, there is absolutely no chance of large scale war right now, I will explain it if you wish to continue this but I need a break, my fingers are tired.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18xiy7", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8k0t3v", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361576891", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "buffalo_pete", "id": "t1_c8jre3j", "parent_id": "t1_c8jffmq", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431373385, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18xiy7", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8jre3j", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361548535", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "IBStallion", "id": "t1_c8jffmq", "parent_id": "t1_c8j60uf", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431367709, "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's not a matter of belief, I'm aware of the existence and validity of the passage in question. \n\nIt also involves the second amendment interpretation provided dealing with government tyranny.

By \"one founding father,\" are you talking about Patrick Henry, George Mason, Samuel Adams, John Adams, Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, or someone I did not name?\n\nYes, as in the context of the federalist papers, #46 was the only one in which James Madison expressed concern about government tyranny through taking away arms.\n\n&gt;There is a mechanism within the charter to do this. It's the amendment process. It's hard, and that's on purpose. Because it's very serious business. But you don't just get to brush the Constitution off. And right now, it says \"shall not be infringed.\"\n\nYou are right, but as it stands right now, Republican politicians have their heads so far up their asses, absolutely nothing can get done. It's pointless to even try at the moment, all you do is waste time and gain theater points. I'm not saying we should brush the Constitution aside, but with the kind of deadlock we have right now, people are looking for legal solutions that don't involve a Congress being lobbied by special interests like the NRA and ALEC. No one is saying take all the guns away, I know for sure that will not solve the problem. But we have to give a definition to what \"arms\" include because that is a very broad label.\n\n&gt;So if you want to stop violence, if you want to stop people getting shot, address the actual problem. You bring me a gun control proposal that starts with de-escalating the militarization of police, and I'll at least hear you out. Until then you're just pissing in the wind.\n\nYes, you are right about cops. The expectations of law enforcement needs to be raised. I'm black, I grew up in bad neighborhood on the south side of LA. I know better then most how bad cops can be. Cops need to be better trained and better educated as well as tightening regulations and increasing transparency. But again we are talking about a special interest group, a highly conservative one at that, the same conservatives that vote for the asses in the Congress that give favors to the Police unions. With that being said, Los Angeles is now one of the safest metropolitan areas in the US, and a lot of it is the very large increase in police numbers. In my opinion, law enforcement officers should serve in a more samaritan capacity, shooting your firearm should be a last resort in conflict resolution.\n\nOn a side note, did you know that the only reason the military cannot be used in a law enforcement capacity within the US is because southern politicians wanted the army to not be there to enforce anti-discrimination laws. Pretty interesting huh?\n\nIn addition, I would like to see a federal office that treats firearms like automobiles; \nregistry\ninsurance\na license for each class of gun \na vigorous mandatory training course focusing on how to safely store the weapon away from children and when it is appropriate to use firearms and outlining non-lethal resolution methods.\nStop the block on the CDC's research on gun violence.\nPay more attention to mental health and increase awareness of it.\nRegulate arms manufacturers so no more stock goes up \"missing.\"\n\nMost of the gun related deaths in this country occur because of accidental firing and crimes of passion, you can't say that we can ignore this any longer.\n\nGuns are tools, but they are being used in the wrong way. Instead of a tool for hunting or hobby, in a lot of cases, they are used as tools to dominate and intimidate. This isn't right, no one should have to fear for their life or be afraid while just walking down the street.\n\n&gt;What the fuck. It already happened. You can be disappeared in this country. No trial, no nothin', one day you're there, the next day you're just gone, and it's perfectly legal. The President can order your murder by fiat using flying death robots.

This isn't 1984, it's 2013, and we're gonna be at war with Eurasia for a mighty long time. We are already there. It happened and we did nothing.\n\nI said it was more *Brave New World* then *1984*, books written very long ago that have frightening similarities to the present. Yes, government power needs to be reigned in, the UAMF needs to be revoked and the Patriot Act needs to disappear. Yes, you are right, we collectively let it happen because we bought into hyperbole and dogmatic ideology. We've let corporations and the wealthiest gain significant power over our elected officials. It is terrible and I hate it, but most people do not give a shit. They are too busy working and scraping by to worry about long term power grabs of the rich and powerful.\n\nBut, there is absolutely no chance of large scale war right now, I will explain it if you wish to continue this but I need a break, my fingers are tired.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18xiy7", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8k0t3v", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361576891", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "buffalo_pete", "id": "t1_c8jre3j", "parent_id": "t1_c8jffmq", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431373385, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18xiy7", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8jre3j", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361548535", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "IBStallion", "id": "t1_c8jffmq", "parent_id": "t1_c8j60uf", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431367709, "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's not a matter of belief, I'm aware of the existence and validity of the passage in question. \n\nIt also involves the second amendment interpretation provided dealing with government tyranny.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "The writer below is right, it changed around World War I. But the Commerce Clause is only part of the story. Read up on [Lochner v. New York](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lochner_v._New_York) and the \"switch in time.\" \n\nMore than that, look into borrowing (or flat out buying, as you won't regret it) Akhil Amar's *America's Constitution: A Biography* ([review](http://travel.nytimes.com/2005/11/06/books/review/06ryerson.html?_r=0)). \n\nA few other points. It's not correct to say that the federal government takes \"plenary police powers.\" There is no federal common law, for example, so almost all common law rights and remedies remain creations of state law. (Though both sides of the aisle intrude on this citing the commerce clause: e.g., federalized tort reform?) And, much of the seemingly plenary power the federal government exercises through the Commerce Clause could be lawfully done by other means. Antidiscrimination law, for example, is a really tough sell under the Commerce Clause. But it's an easy one under the 14th Amendment's Enforcement Clause. So the Supreme Court, rather than striking down the Civil Rights Act and asking Congress to rewrite it through the Enforcement Clause, simply shrugged and let it be. Bad law, but good politics, and all lawyers know that civil rights are *sui generis*, so there's no risk of pushing it beyond that narrow exception. \n\nNote too that the Supreme Court has pulled back in a lot of ways. You can't say \"COMMERCE\" and pass anything these days, and that's as it should be. The Gun-Free School Zone Act, for example, used to be justified because \"violence affects commerce.\" That's obviously an exception that swallows the rule. Now the GFSZA punishes possession of a gun *used in interstate commerce* near a school zone. Which has almost the same effect, yes. But it fits a little nicer in the Commerce Clause framework.\n\nLastly, there's no question that the Framers intended the Commerce Clause to allow national solutions to national problems.

If the commerce clause was stricken from the Constitution, I would be VERY hard pressed to find a legitimate power that empowers the Congress to enable the DEA, continue the horrible practice of a national Minimum Wage, the Medicare/aid disasters, and the thousands of federal criminal laws that all rest on the Commerce Clause.  \n\nI think that the Civil Rights Act is the greatest example of a lazy Congress.  They have the great powers of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to use to get a Civil Rights Act passed, but they use the Commerce Clause!?!? Dafuq?!  Think about it, they twist the Commerce Clause to enact a civil rights act... but they couldn't think up a way to twist the awesome power they have under the 13th Amendment?

I'll put this tersely because I have to go: Think about the dormant commerce clause doctrine; *that* is what the commerce clause is supposed to be and nothing else.  \n\nThe dormant commerce clause doctrine stops states from acting in isolationist ways - that is the breadth and scope of the state portion of the foreign commerce clause power; not making it a federal crime to rob a CVS with a gun.  \n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c86wdmf", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1359644628", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t3_17lfpa", "score": 5, "retrieved_on": 1431135919, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "lawyer", "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_17lfpa", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c86nier", "author_flair_text": "[Lawyer][Center-left]", "created_utc": "1359599453", "ups": 5, "distinguished": null}

Guerilla warfare can't always be beaten by tanks and planes.\n\nEdit: I get your question now, the other thing is that if the standing army of the US is trying to take over the country, they will need soldiers to occupy all of the towns. This nation was built upon fighting for the homeland. When people are fighting for their homes, they usually fight harder than the attacker. This is because they have more to lose if they lose. Guerrilla warfare is really tough to beat with a standing army. It is the one way to defend against things like tanks and planes. When the Nazis invaded the french there was still a resistance movement. This helped the US eventually invade back. If you'll notice, the civil war was our bloodiest. That is the consequence of having the country armed. When people squabble with guns, its between neighbors and friends. It is a very different situation, but the guns are effective in stopping some armed regime, even a bad US government. They are not effective in the way most people think, where rednecks are shooting their guns at tanks. Its really more people in cities using the weapons to lay traps for those tanks and take home court advantage.", "edited": 1357860917, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_16avwh", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7ujuqa", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357842520", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c7ucwkg", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1430917963, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "lawyer", "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7ujmrm", "author_flair_text": "[Lawyer][Center-left]", "created_utc": "1357841899", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}

Heller provides a good starting point. In brief, he (and a majority of the Supreme Court) view the Second Amendment as creating (1) an individual right to bear arms for the purpose of self defense, hunting, and joining a militia, and (2) a right to use such arms as are \"in common use\" in a militia. \n\nAs he sees it, the militia justification does *not*, by itself, justify the People in arming themselves to the teeth. It allows them what the Founders allowed themselves: to possess ordinary, everyday weapons like rifles and pistols.\n\nScalia notes (in Sections II and III) that while an 18th century militia armed accordingly was a threat to an 18th century government, a modern militia armed with nothing more than long rifles and pistols would not be an equal threat to a modern government. But he says that doesn't matter. Consistent with his originalist analytical framework, just because the \"fit\" between the Second Amendment and the last-bulwark-against-tyranny justification is looser doesn't mean justify either ignoring the Amendment, or expanding it beyond its original meaning. It means now what it meant then, even if today, it's a much weaker guarantee against tyranny. \n\nIn other words, yes, the Second Amendment contemplates the use of weapons for armed revolution. But it doesn't of its own force confer the right to bear such arms as would be actually effective in pursuit of that goal.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Presumptions work differently in legislation than in adjudication. That's the simple answer. \n\nThe more complicated one is this!\n\nSet guilt to one side for a minute. Legislators can decide whether a certain thing is presumably good, or presumably bad, on a pretty light showing. The classic case is the \"filled milk\" case -- there, the Court held that a legislature need only prove a \"rational basis\" to discriminate between a legal product, and a banned one. \n\nThe rubric tightens when you consider \"fundamental rights,\" but also requires a finer analysis.  If Congress wanted to take away your [fundamental] right to have a gun, they'd have to clear a very high threshold. But there's no currently-recognized constitutional right to a high-capacity magazine, so a legislature could ban that, I think, on a mere showing of rationality. \n\nThat's how legislatures are allowed to carve out certain distinctions. The presumption of *individual* guilt doesn't matter yet. That only comes into play when an executive officer, a prosecutor, tries to apply a specific law to your case.  S/he can't convict you of violating a law, ANY law, except by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. That never changes. \n\nSo, \"assumption of guilt\" vs. \"second amendment\" is a little apples to oranges.

Occupy may not have forced any real change, but they did flag serious issues that are now getting serious consideration, in a more real way than they did before. \n\n(Note that, despite electing a few congressmen and attaining wider visibility, the Tea Party hasn't been any more successful than that.)\n\nThat said, there are a number of things that should have been done differently to maximize impact, but they're all problems inherent in a quasi-anarchic movement.\n \n* Occupy needed a leader who could talk to the press.\n\n* Occupy needed a leader who could define specific goals.\n\n* Occupy needed to advertise those goals.\n\n* Occupy needed a leader who could keep out the riff-raff -- i.e., people who just went to Zuccotti Park to smoke weed, commit crimes, or otherwise be creepy. I walked through/by Zuccotti commonly, and anyone who was there knows where that group was (towards the back, by the WTC). That made the movement all-too-easy to villify. Occupy also lost cohesion once it was infected by communists, Paul supporters, and anti-Semites (see below). \n\n* Occupy needed to excise any outright allegiance with atheism, Marxism, communism, and true socialism (state ownership of the means of production). This is not a society ready to toss out The System. This is a society ready to reform the system. Outright revolution is justly ridiculed. \n\n* Occupy did a good job cleaning up the park, and making the space livable. But they needed to do better. They lost support from the neighbourhood once the near-24-hour-drum-circle started up. Seriously, many of my friends living within a few blocks had to wear earplugs to sleep, for months. That's just one example.\n\n* Occupy needed to not do dumb marches that would inevitably end in arrests. \n\nFrom that, I conclude that quasi-anarchic movements should not be things.

Never place your finger on the trigger until you are absolutely ready to fire, 4. Beware of your target and what's behind it.\n\n* As they get even older (like High School), you can begin teaching marksmanship basics, and other forms of shooting, like sport shooting.\n\nThis way, you remove the 'mystery' of the gun, you instill responsible behavior, and train folks on both how to use firearms, and how handle them if they need to.\n\nIf you want to instill training, you need to do it early, and often.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1542zv", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7j8odm", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1355951202", "ups": 11, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1542zv", "selftext": "*\"Regulation only affects those who would never break the law to begin with.

Here is a video of an 11 year old completely field stripping and reassembling an AR-15.  \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irykjLjuKo8\n\nIt is important to note that she is doing much much more than inserting the bolt assembly.

This takes place entirely between the 44 second and 47 second time indexes.  The rest of the disassembly/reassembly shown is not required to perform this bolt insertion step, with the exception of pulling the rear detent pin in order to pivot the rifle's upper assembly open.\n\nI bring this up so that folks that may not understand the mechanics of firearms will be better equipped to judge what ramification storing a bolt separately from the firearm really has on the readiness of said firearm.  I will now let you draw your own conclusions on the relevance of bolt storage to the politics of gun ownership.   \n\nI hope you now understand that I was not making things up to try and prove a point.\n\n\n", "edited": 1356299587, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7l6g3e", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1356299018", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c7kztd2", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430754161, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1356301201, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7l66dy", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1356297893", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c7jtm43", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430751069, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I believe the point is moot, anyway.

A fit of rage can pass quickly - but if you can get a gun during that rage, you'll do things you normally wouldn't.\n\nThe man who shot Rep. Giffords wanted to kill her, so he bought a gun and shot her. Imagine what happens in the scenario where he can't get a gun easily. He has to go through hoops to find a gun dealer, which will probably be a shady-looking mob-affiliated guy. By that point, he has had a lot of time to think about what he wants to do - unless he is a true fanatic, he will realize it's a bad idea.\n\nThere are also countless stories about people shooting other people because they stepped on their property, or because an argument escalated. Had they not had guns, they'd have had to use knives, iron bars or other weapons which a) allow the potential victim to get away and b) force the attacked to realize he's about to kill someone instead of shooting first and thinking about it afterwards.\n\nPS: Switzerland's \"universal gun ownership\" is a myth.

Just because the act of stealing is illegal doesn't nullify my point. Look at the Sandy Hook shooting. This woman was, technically, qualified to own an AR-15 and two semi-auto handguns. However, someone else grabbed the guns, which were unsecured, and went on a rampage. This may not have happened if the woman didn't leave those weapons unsecured, or didn't even own them at all.\n\nYes, the man behind the weapon is the one who commits these actions, but shouldn't we do all we can to prevent these people from ending up behind the gun in the first place?
