Fine. If you think they're wrong, then cite a study that refutes their position. If you can't do that, then refute their logic, or present your own logical argument that refutes some or a part of their conclusion.

If someone dismisses the an Daily KOS article just because it came from them, they are equally dishonest. \n\n&gt;The fact is, if you're a Progressive, then you're not going to put a lot of stock in Heritage Foundation articles, the same way a Libertarian wouldn't listen to anything said by Daily Kos.\n\nI agree. People like to be close minded and hate to examine their beliefs. \n\n&gt;In short, you're misapplying the fallacy to imply that because Heritage hasn't formally been proven wrong in this specific case, we should assume that they're right.\n\nThat's not what I'm arguing at all.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1fm2t6", "selftext": "The United States does not recognize the right to armed insurrection against the Federal Government.  Obviously we all know about the Civil War, but even before that, there was the Whiskey Rebellion in 1791, which broke out as the ink was still drying on the Constitution.  As you know, after the Articles of Confederation, the government was in dire financial straits and imposed a whiskey tax to try and raise revenue.  This caused problems with farmers and veterans in western Pennsylvania who considered it taxation without representation, which is what they had just fought England over.  The Constitution gives the President the power to suppress insurrection, so George Washington raised an army to go to western Pennsylvania, but by the time he got there the rebels had disbanded and gone home.\n\n&gt;The Rebellion raised the question of what kinds of protests were permissible under the new Constitution. Legal historian Christian G. Fritz argued, even after ratification of the Constitution, there was not yet a consensus about sovereignty in the United States. Federalists believed the government was sovereign because it had been established by the people, so radical protest actions, which were permissible during the American Revolution, were no longer legitimate. But the Whiskey Rebels and their defenders believed the Revolution had established the people as a \"collective sovereign\", and the people had the collective right to change or challenge the government through extraconstitutional means.[105]\n\n&gt;Historian Steven Boyd argued that the suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion prompted anti-Federalist westerners to finally accept the Constitution, and to seek change by voting for Republicans rather than resisting the government. Federalists, for their part, came to accept that the people could play a greater role in governance. Although Federalists would attempt to restrict speech critical of the government with the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798, after the Whiskey Rebellion, says Boyd, Federalists no longer challenged the freedom of assembly and the right to petition.[106]", "id": "t1_cabskbs", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Stormflux", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cabzfm2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Obsidian743", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1fm2t6", "selftext": "I know what you're asking, but it really isn't that hard.

I flipped through AM radio stations looking for something entertaining that wasn't music.  I came across the Sean Hannity program, and he was talking about Terry Schaivo.  \n\nYou see, there was this woman who was brain-dead and on life support for years.  Her husband wanted to pull the plug, which sounded reasonable in my opinion.  Well, apparently this was just horrible, and proved that all \"liberals\" were cold-blooded murders without a moral compass, and we deserved to go to hell.\n\nAnyway, it entertained me for an hour or so.  This was a few years after the Clinton impeachment, and not long after 9/11.  Republicans and Democrats were pulling together out of patriotism, but here was an entire underground network demonizing people who thought the way I did.\n\nWhat's more, this guy was *so* good at arguing, that even though he was completely wrong, no one could beat him in an argument. \n\nI have to admit, it had an effect on me, though probably not the way Sean intended.\n\nThe point is, this is just *one* incident out of literally thousands that has shaped my political beliefs over the years.  I only remember it because another comment brought back the memory.\n\nSo, when someone on a message board gets it in their head to argue with me, over Benghazi or anything else...  well, it's just rhetoric.  \n\nMy beliefs are shaped by my experiences, and when some of my earliest political memories include a bunch of fat white guys impeaching a Democratic president over what amounted to a sexual affair, when they themselves were unfaithful; it has an impact.  And yes, I know it was ostensibly over perjury, but the point still stands.\n\nNow I see those same fat white guys refusing to work with a President who I think is a genuinely good guy; promising on day one not to cooperate on anything.\n\nThought exercise: you're a Republican on Reddit, and you tell me \"Obama's main failing is he hasn't been able to find a way to work with us.\"\n\nDo you think I'm going to see it your way?

Drones have less civilian casualties than carpet bombing, sure, but I would not deem them \"precise\" just because they are more precise relatively.

While it is technically true, it does not make it a \"precision strike.\" Furthermore, this is not Korea or Vietnam or WWII, where either the UN, NATO, or the US itself declared war. As far as the international community is concerned, we are at peace with these nations and we are actively killing their citizens\n\nI do not think you should be so quick to dismiss civilian casualties as a driving factor for the opposition against drones. As I said in my main post, civilian casualties, besides being a tragic loss of life, also help contribute to increased anti-US sentiment and create a cycle of radical militarization which runs counter to US interests.\n\nAs far as Anwar al Aulaqi goes, I don't think this is the right discussion to have a talk about that as it kind of shies away from the main question, but you should keep in mind that the US government assassinating its citizens who it believes are enemy combatants is not legal in any sense - most people would rather him stand trial for treason or what have you instead of having him killed without trial.\n\nAnother thing to point out is that the United States is not at war with countries like Yemen, Pakistan, or Somalia and therefore the US has much less leniency over what it can do in those territories.\n\nAs far as international law goes, the issue is a bit hazy over how it is to be enforced, and you are right in saying that the US would never allow it to be enforced on the US - why would it? However, breaking international law still matters because it affects the global perception of the US. If the US is seen as a nation who will flaunt any agreements when it is in its interest, it gives credence to the narratives coming out of places like Iran or the DPRK of the US as nothing more than a bully on a power trip, and it also makes other states trust us less, making diplomacy much harder.\n\nAs I pointed out in my post however, none of these reasons are the main reasons drone strikes are seen as worse than other types of bombings - the drone strikes violate the sovereignty of other nations and are counter productive and expensive.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9ndode", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1367014776", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Stormflux", "id": "t1_c9ncugq", "parent_id": "t1_c9n9pn8", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431416320, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1d60e3", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9ncugq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1367012254", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}

All that said, the decision to capture him alive at all costs or only if he surrenders has to be made before the operation, a question you never answered.\n\nThe US *doesnt* have authority to send soldiers into Pakistan - it's an act of war. Political and military folks (ambassador and a general) were waiting to call their Pakistani counterparts as soon as the US were out of Pakistsni airspace. That said, given that the US couldn't assume some aspect of the Palistani state *werent* protecting OBL, what other choice did they have.\n\nIt's easy to poke at the \"illegal\" aspects of the counterterrorism operations.\n\nMy question for you is this: if you were president, what would *you* have done?", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1d60e3", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1d60e3", "selftext": "&gt;If I was suddenly transported into that office under current conditions, I might make the some choices as Obama, but I would still be doing illegal and immoral things.\n\nThat's a great answer. At least you put your self in the shoes of the person making that call and realized that the question isn't simple.\n\nThe other thing that I think is a hard mental leap in the first world is grappling with the idea of rule-of-law. There are many jurisdictions and countries where the remit of the government does not extend to all areas notionally governed. So the Pakistani tribal areas, Yemen and the more extreme example of Somalia. If you do the thought experiment that OBL is in a compound in England, you would imagine the US would ask the UK government to handle the arrest. We trust that the UK government is monolithic (does not have rebel factions acting in different directions) and that the UK government can act and impose power *anywhere* inside its territory.\n\nThose assumptions are simply false in Yemen or Pakistan.\n\nSo while you can apply the ideal of preserving national sovereignty (capturing/killing OBL is a \"serious crime\") the fact on the ground is that Yemeni or Pakistani sovereignty is itself an ideal - and an ideal not realized. Whether in the tribal areas where the Islamabad government has no control or in the Abbotabad compound where (presumably) the ISI or a similar faction had carved out a safe haven for OBL, the government is *not* in a position to provide rule-of-law and arrest OBL.\n\nSo given *that* reality, should a country with the power to act (Pakistan would probably not have the power to capture someone in Texas) do so or should it hold back to preserve a utopian ideal of sovereignty and rule of law that does not in fact exist?\n\nIf OBL was hiding out in a failed state like Somalia instead of Pakistan would it change your view on a capture-or-kill operation? Would it still be an \"act of war\" if the state being \"invaded\" didn't exist in any meaningful way?", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1d60e3", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I was born in Ireland, I think the UK government could have served a warrant in South Armagh or the Bogside with enough planning, though at the risk of British lives.

The British tried a variety of [different](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplock_courts) [methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles#1970s) to deal with terrorism \"legally\" with very little success. Basically, as with the drone program, \"eliminating\" your terrorist enemy through internment, jury free courts or extrajudicial killing (as the UK tried with the IRA) or a hellfire missile just radicalizes more people. It is not a fight that can be \"won.\" The other side wants to establish a worldwide caliphate and arewilling to kill to pursue that aim.\n\nI don't know if you see this coming but I'm constructing a slippery slope for you. If its ok to capture/kill OBL as the AQ #1 because his location is \"outside\" national boundaries (the tribal areas being kind of like a Somalia within Pakistan), is it ok to capture/kill the AQ #2 for the same reason? I've lost count but I believe the US has killed or tried to kill the AQ #2 (probably strategically more important than OBL) over a dozen times. Then the question becomes \"how far down the chain of command is killing the AQ #X ok?\" I don't have answers to these questions but clearly, wishing for an ideal world where countries have rule-of-law and sovereignty everywhere inside their boundaries is not a solution.

As far as I know, they didn't have any really legitimate claim to Ireland in the first place. Although, the IRA shouldn't have killed innocent people in pursuit of their goals, from their perspective they were acting to expel an illegitimate colonial government, and I have some sympathy with that view.  I say this as an ethnically 'anglo-saxon' settler of a former British colony.\n\nWhat they should do in the case that some of their citizens are killed by members of the IRA is a complicated question. But as far as I can tell, the only way that these cycles of retributive violence can be avoided is through the establishment of systems of legal order through which disputes can be resolved fairly and impartially. In such cases, all actors must relinquish, or be forced to relinquish their claims to the use of illegitimate force. This is the basis of stable social orders within states, and the basis for systems of international law and governance, which though flawed are probably our best bet for avoiding never ending cycles of international violence and their realpolitik justifications.\n\nWishing for an ideal world, as well as acting in concrete ways to bring it about, is in my mind the only real way to address these issues. It reminds me of the Situationist slogan \"be realistic, demand the impossible.\" For what it's worth I don't actually believe that countries should have sovereignty everywhere within their borders. I think some kind of decentralized global federalism would be a better model. How to achieve these goals is somewhat unclear, but at least some attempt to do so would be nice. The US doesn't even try, which essentially blocks the whole thing from ever happening. \n\nWhile it might be true that one must occasionally \"hold ones nose and respond,\" the US does an awful lot of nose-holding. Indeed, given that they are probably the primary proponents of global violence, one gets the impression that they are rather used to the scent of such distasteful acts.\n\nPolitical capital, in my view has nothing to do with this. The notion that Obama must accede to demands for international slaughter in order to press his own domestic program is in no way a justification. I'm sure it played into his decision making, but it is not an argument in favor of violating international law. \n\n\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9nwta8", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1367096837", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "bunabhucan", "id": "t1_c9nw3dj", "parent_id": "t1_c9nv6ms", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431407106, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1d60e3", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9nw3dj", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1367094367", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Shankley", "id": "t1_c9nv6ms", "parent_id": "t1_c9nuv6z", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431407536, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Fair enough, the conditions in Pakistan may make it much more difficult to pursue things like extradition. \n\nIt should be noted that, until very recently the UK did indeed have rebel groups operating within its claimed territory, and was actually forced to relinquish it's claims to some of it's territory.

And I could be wrong here, but since we're talking about apples...\n\nMy understanding is that we actually have enough apples and other foodstuffs to solve world hunger, but there's no way to distribute them efficiently besides the free market.  Obviously this means that there could be a warehouse full of apples nearby, but if you don't have any money...\n\nSo, a lot of food ends up rotting instead of being eaten, especially when austerity kicks in.  This is a problem not just with food, but as production becomes more and more automated, we're heading for the \"Google economy\" where lots of stuff is free, but no one has a job.  Look at Wikipedia, it's great.  But obviously it means nobody at Encyclopedia Brittanica has a job anymore.  I think we're seeing this on a large scale if you look at old shows like *Seinfeld* where people like Elaine work in publishing jobs which have since been replaced by the Internet and computers.  Look at old shows and you see legions of people sitting around doing jobs that don't need to be done anymore.\n\nWe're fast approaching the point where people don't *need* to be working 40 hours a week, but we still require them to.  Only now, they have to work in \"service sector\" jobs, which basically means two part-time jobs with no health care and no empowerment, while all of the profits go to the top.\n\n**********************************\n\nThe other thing is, and I could be wrong about this too, but you said inflation would devalue my savings.  But, most Americans don't *have* any savings.  They have debt.\n\nI'll put it another way.  If you took out a mortgage in 1970 for $30,000, that's a lot of money at first and you probably struggled to make your payments.  But, by the time 1990 rolled around, that same $30,000 mortgage is a joke.  You might as well pay off the remaining balance with loose change you find in your couch cushions.\n\nWell, I've got a $200,000 mortgage, so you can see why I'd be OK with some inflation if it means my income goes up.  My debt is fixed, it won't go up with inflation, but hopefully my income would.  Also, I think we owe it to seniors to give them some kind of stipend to live on to keep them out of poverty, as well as get them out of the work force so younger people can have those jobs.\n\nOf course, the people that make policy decisions tend to be the same people who hold my mortgage.   So for them, maybe inflation and Social Security are a bad thing?  I really don't see why though, unless it's ideological.  After all, a lot of that Social Security is so they can buy groceries from your store, or make payments on a car that came from your factory.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bx68k", "selftext": "Wow. Okay, there's a lot in here. \n\n1. I'm not a foodstuffs expert. I have no idea where you can go to get that answer. [Here's](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/worldwide-crisis-the-geopolitics-of-food-scarcity-a-606937.html) an article discussing what's driving global food scarcity. On a cursory read, it appears there *is* a scarcity problem. While many nations are wasteful in their food consumption, I do not find it credible that the waste of these nations is driving food scarcity in underdeveloped nations. Also, you need to consider transportation issues. Sure, there's an overabundance of ... apples ... in one part of the world. Can you effectively transport those apples to another part of the world cost effectively? Would it make more sense to find a substitute fruit to grow in the apple-less region?\n2. Yes, process automation is a driving force in the increase in worker productivity. That means that fewer humans are needed to do more things. [Here's an album](http://imgur.com/a/VYRqC) of tables that the [Bureau of Labor and Statistics](http://www.bls.gov/lpc/#tables) compiled showing the relative productive capacity and hourly compensation over time. The vertical grey bars indicate recessionary periods. \n3. There are some really interesting discussions on the future of an automated society in /r/automation. You should go ask them some of your questions as they'll be better equipped to answer you completely.\n4. True, Americans tend to save less than the average industrialized citizen. But that doesn't mean they *don't* save **at all**. \n5. Inflation is generally considered to be a bad thing for the economy in aggregate. But, in your debtor instance, inflation can help you repay your loans more easily. In fact, many large firms are currently taking out bonds or other debt instruments because the annual interest owed on those securities is less than inflation. So, the value of their dollar grows more than what they owe in interest. (Not to mention the [tax shield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_shield) benefit of having debt securities.)\n6. Seniors do receive a stipend to stay out of poverty in the US. It's called social security. And medicare. And pensions/401Ks/IRAs. Social security and medicare are both tied to inflation measures (consumer price indices) to ensure that the real value of disbursements is consistent over time. Currently, the US federal government is debating whether to change the CPI to what's called a \"[chain CPI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Chained_Consumer_Price_Index)\" that will reduce the amount of increased payments each year. Some argue that this will negatively impact seniors' ability to support themselves, while others argue that it won't and that changing to the chain CPI will reduce the federal deficit. \n6. The people who make policy decisions are elected officials. They do not hold your mortgage. Your mortgage is held by a bank, or more likely by Fannie Mae/Freddy Mac. While those are government owned entities, those who work for FM/FM are executive branch officials. Those who make the laws are legislative branch officials. There is a clear separation between the two. ", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bx68k", "selftext": "Thanks for the answer.

In other words, printing enough money to solve our government problems could actually freeze up just as much money in the private sector?\n\nWell this makes me feel like I should first point out that the Fed is a public/private partnership; while private banks do have a voice in its management, the people with the most influence over top-level policy are public servants appointed by the government and don't have a direct personal stake in the performance of particular banks.\n\nAnyway, I'm not 100% sure I've understood your question correctly, but from what I *think* you meant, the answer is no.  The danger from excessive printing isn't that private sector lending will decline (at least not immediately), it's that hyperinflation would result.  Rapidly growing prices make it very hard for people to afford anything and for businesses to operate because their current revenues won't cover future costs.\n\nI suspect you may be thinking of the \"crowding out\" effect, which is a concern about excessive government *borrowing*.  Large government borrowing can drive up interest rates on public debt, which makes private loans less attractive, thereby reducing private investment.  At the moment, that sort of thing isn't really a concern in the US because interest rates on government debt are still very low.\n\n&gt;And I hear your two examples of hyperinflation often, but are there really a significant number of examples of this in countries that were not also ravaged by other problems of the grandest scale (massive debt/instability)?\n\nThere may be, but not that I can think of off the top of my head.  The sorts of problems that you're thinking of are usually the *reason* that a country resorts to extreme currency printing programs.  No government every really *wants* to just print its way to solvency, but it can sometimes seem like an easy (or the only) way out of dire financial straits.\n\n&gt;How many US dollars are in \"existence\" now? For hyperinflation to occur, wouldn't there need to be hundreds or thousands of times this amount printed? Given the magnitude of the dollar, would it be safe to assume that it is unlikely that even twice as many dollars should be printed? Even if we considered the possibility of $1 trillion platinum coins?\n\nHooo boy.  You should know that monetary economics is a pretty deep rabbit hole to jump down.  Basic principles can seem counterintuitive, and many things are controlled by beliefs and expectations rather than tangible quantities and facts.  You can make a legitimate argument that central bankers are con-men... because that's what they need to be in order for the economy to function at its best.\n\n*So:* what's total amount of US dollars?  The most accurate answer to that is \"nobody knows for certain\".  Money creation is hideously complicated and not controlled by any single institution (the Federal Reserve just has the *most* influence over it out of everyone).  It's only possible to *estimate* the total supply... but unfortunately the Fed stopped collecting statistics on its broadest measure of the money supply (which wasn't even as broad as it *could* be to begin with) in 2006.  Right now its estimate of just the \"monetary base\" (physical currency and bank reserves) is getting up to around [$3 trillion](http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/H3/Current/).  **M2**, the Fed's current broadest money measure, which includes less liquid assets like CDs, is closer to [$10 trillion](http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/current/h6.htm).\n\nFor hyperinflation to occur, technically all that needs to happen is for people to *expect* hyperinflation, as businesses will thus start raising their prices accordingly.  It's hard to say how much money we'd have to print to create those expectations.  This is why the Federal Reserve usually explains its policies along the lines of \"we're going to set interest rates at X and keep them there until inflation reaches level Y\"; they set policy and then adjust it on the fly according to the results they observe.\n\nAlso keep in mind that the rate at which currency circulates (called the \"velocity of money\") is just as important as the total amount of currency in circulation.  In a period of economic decline, you expect velocity to decrease because fewer people are trading as often, while the reverse is true during growth.  So if you imagine printing enough money to double the amount in circulation: if people are only exchanging that money one quarter as frequently as they used to, then you still wouldn't expect inflation to result.\n\n\n---\n\n\nSigh, I'm sure all of that mostly just served to befuddle everyone reading it, sorry.

They can print more money, lets say another $10, but that doesn't mean there are more apples. Economics would tell us the price of apples should rise to $2 apiece. Thus, your savings account has devalued or depreciated; you can buy fewer apples with the same amount of money. The price of goods has **inflated**. \n\nIn a real economy, there are millions of goods and services to buy, but it's still a finite number. Printing more dollars devalues that currency and creates inflation. Americans can buy fewer goods and services with their money. While the Federal Reserve is printing a lot of money (~$80 billion, with a B, per month) inflation is historically low, if not nonexistent. \n\nAnd that's the Fed's job: controlling the money supply (number of dollars in the system) high enough to encourage job growth while keeping it low enough to prevent high inflation.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bx68k", "selftext": "Ok, thanks for the answer.  And I could be wrong here, but since we're talking about apples...\n\nMy understanding is that we actually have enough apples and other foodstuffs to solve world hunger, but there's no way to distribute them efficiently besides the free market.  Obviously this means that there could be a warehouse full of apples nearby, but if you don't have any money...\n\nSo, a lot of food ends up rotting instead of being eaten, especially when austerity kicks in.  This is a problem not just with food, but as production becomes more and more automated, we're heading for the \"Google economy\" where lots of stuff is free, but no one has a job.  Look at Wikipedia, it's great.  But obviously it means nobody at Encyclopedia Brittanica has a job anymore.  I think we're seeing this on a large scale if you look at old shows like *Seinfeld* where people like Elaine work in publishing jobs which have since been replaced by the Internet and computers.  Look at old shows and you see legions of people sitting around doing jobs that don't need to be done anymore.\n\nWe're fast approaching the point where people don't *need* to be working 40 hours a week, but we still require them to.  Only now, they have to work in \"service sector\" jobs, which basically means two part-time jobs with no health care and no empowerment, while all of the profits go to the top.\n\n**********************************\n\nThe other thing is, and I could be wrong about this too, but you said inflation would devalue my savings.  But, most Americans don't *have* any savings.  They have debt.\n\nI'll put it another way.  If you took out a mortgage in 1970 for $30,000, that's a lot of money at first and you probably struggled to make your payments.  But, by the time 1990 rolled around, that same $30,000 mortgage is a joke.  You might as well pay off the remaining balance with loose change you find in your couch cushions.\n\nWell, I've got a $200,000 mortgage, so you can see why I'd be OK with some inflation if it means my income goes up.  My debt is fixed, it won't go up with inflation, but hopefully my income would.  Also, I think we owe it to seniors to give them some kind of stipend to live on to keep them out of poverty, as well as get them out of the work force so younger people can have those jobs.\n\nOf course, the people that make policy decisions tend to be the same people who hold my mortgage.   So for them, maybe inflation and Social Security are a bad thing?  I really don't see why though, unless it's ideological.

Okay, there's a lot in here. \n\n1. I'm not a foodstuffs expert. I have no idea where you can go to get that answer. [Here's](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/worldwide-crisis-the-geopolitics-of-food-scarcity-a-606937.html) an article discussing what's driving global food scarcity. On a cursory read, it appears there *is* a scarcity problem. While many nations are wasteful in their food consumption, I do not find it credible that the waste of these nations is driving food scarcity in underdeveloped nations. Also, you need to consider transportation issues. Sure, there's an overabundance of ... apples ... in one part of the world. Can you effectively transport those apples to another part of the world cost effectively? Would it make more sense to find a substitute fruit to grow in the apple-less region?\n2. Yes, process automation is a driving force in the increase in worker productivity. That means that fewer humans are needed to do more things. [Here's an album](http://imgur.com/a/VYRqC) of tables that the [Bureau of Labor and Statistics](http://www.bls.gov/lpc/#tables) compiled showing the relative productive capacity and hourly compensation over time. The vertical grey bars indicate recessionary periods. \n3. There are some really interesting discussions on the future of an automated society in /r/automation. You should go ask them some of your questions as they'll be better equipped to answer you completely.\n4. True, Americans tend to save less than the average industrialized citizen. But that doesn't mean they *don't* save **at all**. \n5. Inflation is generally considered to be a bad thing for the economy in aggregate. But, in your debtor instance, inflation can help you repay your loans more easily. In fact, many large firms are currently taking out bonds or other debt instruments because the annual interest owed on those securities is less than inflation. So, the value of their dollar grows more than what they owe in interest. (Not to mention the [tax shield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_shield) benefit of having debt securities.)\n6. Seniors do receive a stipend to stay out of poverty in the US. It's called social security. And medicare. And pensions/401Ks/IRAs. Social security and medicare are both tied to inflation measures (consumer price indices) to ensure that the real value of disbursements is consistent over time. Currently, the US federal government is debating whether to change the CPI to what's called a \"[chain CPI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Chained_Consumer_Price_Index)\" that will reduce the amount of increased payments each year. Some argue that this will negatively impact seniors' ability to support themselves, while others argue that it won't and that changing to the chain CPI will reduce the federal deficit. \n6. The people who make policy decisions are elected officials. They do not hold your mortgage. Your mortgage is held by a bank, or more likely by Fannie Mae/Freddy Mac. While those are government owned entities, those who work for FM/FM are executive branch officials. Those who make the laws are legislative branch officials.

You need to determine who the officers will be, how they're chosen, what jobs they have, how decisions get made, etc.\n\nIts job isn't really to \"protect people from government,\" but to define what the government is and how it works at a very high level.\n\nIf something is really important, like \"free speech\" or \"nobody is allowed to have sex with a pig,\" then yes you can put it directly in the charter.  The charter is the final authority on everything, so you can put whatever you want in it.  There's no higher document stopping you.  By doing so, it becomes a fundamental part of the organization and cannot be changed unless the charter is changed.  \n\nThe same way a charter overrides an organizations bylaws, the Constitution overrides any laws that conflict with it.  Constitution &gt; Federal Law and Treaties &gt; State Law &gt; Local Law.  For example, Congress can declare war even if there's a treaty saying not to, because federal law and treaties are on the same level.  The declaration of war just overrides that part of the treaty (\"Congress changed their mind\").\n\nOf course, in the Constitution's case, the wording is incredibly vague subject to much scholarly debate over what it all means.  Since *Malbury v. Madison*, the Supreme Court has become the authority on interpretation.\n\nTo answer your question, *in general* the Constitutional protections on free speech, equal protection under the law, etc. apply to everyone.  That's because there isn't any language saying that it only applies to citizens.  However, there are some limits on Constitutional protection.  For instance, the Constitution can't protect Iranians from the Iranian government, because the Constitution doesn't have authority over the Iranian government.  Also, some Constitutional protections like free speech can be overridden according to the doctrine of \"strict scrutiny\" which the Supreme Court has defined.  Finally, protections like the 4th amendment deprivation of life without due process obviously are obviously modified a bit in an armed conflict or battlefield situations.

But this, at least, seems to be enough that a regular guy like me could theoretically run for office and be able to live in D.C. if I won.  \n\nOk, so I probably couldn't afford to fly back to my district and campaign, but still.  Under the current salary, it's at least theoretically possible to be a congressman and not independently wealthy.\n\nSo, I'm curious that this is the first thing people always look to cut.  I think it has to do with \"those bums not doing their jobs, why should they get anything!\"  That's a good point.  But you also realize if they made $0 it would make what's already a rich person only club even worse.  You'd be affecting the one guy who actually needs that salary, who is also probably the best congressman just because he's a regular guy.  I guess he'd have no choice but to take bribes or quit office.\n\nJust something to think about.\n\nNow to answer your question, the reason this doesn't take effect is because of the 27th amendment, Congress can't pass any salary adjustments that take effect before next term.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_19kcr7", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gonzzzo", "id": "t1_c8p0h78", "parent_id": "t1_c8ox3im", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431469825, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; You'd be affecting the one guy who actually needs that salary\n\nI see what your saying, and its something I haven't considered. I realize theres probably a few exceptions on both sides of the aisle but I imagine that most congressmen's lifestyles would be fairly unaffected if they didn't receive their congressional salaries for  a length of time\n\nBut yea, I hadn't thought of the 27th amendment...damn...I guess I was thinking about the political theater of the vote itself more than the vote ever actually passing.
