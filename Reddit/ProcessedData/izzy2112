Cadmium is a heavy metal, heavier and more toxic than lead. Many of the (mostly) women who worked in this factory ended up with kidney and liver failure and were set to die by the time they were in their mid-late twenties. As a response they protested, they organized, and they lobbied their local government to do everything within their power to ensure that this wouldn't happen to others.\n\nIt is true that these are opportunities.

Unskilled labor is plentiful and exploitable and without regulations, without unions, without some way of the worker making their interests heard and represented, they will be trampled *regardless* of whether the nation is or is not industrialized.

The United States &amp; Israel have significant military &amp; intelligence cooperation and our alliance with Israel is pretty important to our strategic goals in the United States. I know Reddit likes to circlejerk with Israel-hate, but it's the most liberal &amp; stable state in the region. How many Democracies does the United States not back?\n\n* Being a stable state with effective governance is key. Nearly every country in the region is an ally of the United States. It's probably just Syria &amp; Iran that are enemies. But remember what happened during the Arab Spring? In six months, the governments of Saudi Arabia or Egypt or Iraq could be overthrown and it wouldn't be shocking. Israel's government isn't going to be overthrown.\n\n* Similarly, the effective governance within Israel makes them far easier to work with than authoritarian regimes, where the interests of the state are often secondary to various other parties. Take Pakistan, where the military's interests often differ from the political leadership's. It's tough to know who you're dealing with in Pakistan, since the Prime Minister of Pakistan isn't really in charge of a lot of things. In Israel, the Prime Minister is in charge, making cooperation far easier.\n\n* On the issue of aid, it's worth noting that it's pretty much all for military purposes. We do the same exact thing with a lot of countries.\n\n* Many experts have commented on the intelligence cooperation that American intelligence cooperation with Israel is extrememley rewarding. If true, then the intelligence gains are probably worth a lot more than $3 billion.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "theWires", "id": "t1_ceim25d", "parent_id": "t1_ceifagf", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431821237, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Lot's of hidden premises and contentious assumptions here.\n\nYou seem to either equate the interests of the US (the state) with those of the US population, or you simply don't go into it.\n\nYou suggest that *democracy* is worth backing for its own sake, yet you paint Arab revolts against tyranny as nothing but a threat. Apologists for American foreign policy love using the 'democracy card', but it's apparent that this is a virtually complete non-issue. Why even bring it up if it's not a serious consideration at all? Or maybe it is a consideration. Only, it's a consideration in the exact opposite direction than you suggest. Israel hated the Arab revolts. Israel wants the Arab populations to remain oppressed. Even when totally disregarding the Palestinians, Israel has shown itself to be a force against the emancipation of non-Jews in the region. This tells us something about the value of backing Israel for the sake of democracy.\n\nYou suggest that *stability* is desirable. I'll agree that this a valid consideration for the US. However, I don't know of any powerful global player that acts as if democratic states are more obedient or stable allies than undemocratic ones. Standard procedure is to court the favor of the strongest, most violent local partners regardless of anything else. Israel *became* an ally only after it demonstrated its usefulness by beating back Arab attacks. Before that the US was anything but enthusiastic about Zionism or 'democracy' in the Middle East.\n\n&gt;Similarly, the effective governance within Israel makes them far easier to work with than authoritarian regimes, where the interests of the state are often secondary to various other parties. Take Pakistan, where...\n\nAgain, no! Pakistan is a special case. It's one of those countries like Thailand and Turkey where there are as many coups as elections. Its \"authoritarian\" nature is not the issue. The norm is that dictatorships are very accommodating and reliable partners precisely because the US doesn't need to be very concerned with what some supreme court might say, what the population might want, what the next elections will bring etc... If Saudi-Arabia were democratic it is not obvious to me that it would be one of Israels strongest allies in the region. I will, however, agree that Israel is also a special case. It seems, at times, to be 'a little bit' too eager to fly off the chain, but its 'natural interests' (which I won't go into) are fairly well aligned with those of the US at the moment and there doesn't seem to be any change in that for the foreseeable future.\n\nLet's finish off with the way you started \n\n&gt;There's a big difference between the United States stopping aid to Israel and the United States stopping all political support for Israel. The first wouldn't be a major deal, it would probably hurt Israel &amp; defense contractors a bit, but both would be fine. The second would be a bad mistake.\n\nYou don't go into how it would be a mistake. I mean, if you're going to speculate about something like this, don't you need a scenario? Why/how would the US be ending some or \"all\" political support? \n\nWhat I would argue that the US-Israel relationship could continue with much increased US diplomatic pressure on Israel. Such pressure or threats of reduced diplomatic support (in the UN, for example) is completely warranted if we give a damn about human rights and the long-term survival of Israel. I noticed in your defense of current US policy towards Israel that you didn't mention what is arguably the most important reason why Israel is justified in its extreme fear of Arab democracy. Israel's continued abuse of Palestinians is a PR nightmare for both the US and Israel. It is an issue where some progress is relatively easy to achieve. However, for internal political reasons, Israel is incapable of ending its escalation of abuse. The situation is not at a stand-still; it is continually deteriorating. Israel is a junior parter. In theory, the US is capable of curbing some of Israel's more 'fascist' tendencies. Israel clearly suffers from the political/military equivalent of \"affluenza\".\n\nOh, and :\n\n&gt;Many experts have commented on the intelligence cooperation that American intelligence cooperation with Israel is extrememley rewarding. If true, then the intelligence gains are probably worth a lot more than $3 billion.\n\nPure speculation. But even if there's a lot of truth to that, it doesn't come cheap for Israelis. Israel's huge military and intelligence expenditures are a great burden for the Israeli population. A normalization of relations with certain peoples and states within the region would undoubtedly be a blessing for them. Arguably, the nature of the current US-Israel relationship keeps Israel from seriously pursuing this kind of regional peace.

I think that his legislative accomplishments have been significant, perhaps the most significant of any President since LBJ. I think that his foreign policy has been more good than bad. At this point, I may argue that he's the best President since Johnson. Since I'm a liberal, that really only leaves Clinton &amp; Carter as his competitors. Carter accomplished relatively little and Clinton had few legislative accomplishments, many of which were continuations of the Reagan legacy.\n\nAs for the specific things you mentioned. I'm skeptical that the NSA stuff will be a significant part of his legacy. I disagree with the characterization of the ACA being \"flopped healthcare\".

And then there's simple math.  If my starting point is 100 and I add 100 to it on my watch, I've increased spending by 100%.  But if I'm the next person and add 150 to it, I've only increased it by 75%!  But that's not really the case - I just had a bigger denominator to work with.  You can compare increases of spending to some base year for all comparisons (although it has its downsides as well) or versus GDP (again, it has downsides as well).  And then there's the differences/manipulations in passing credit/blame back and forth in changing what is \"Obama's\" or \"Bush's\", or even just changing the measuring period.  If we take spending since 1980, the average of the annual YOY increase is slightly above 6%.  Since 1992, it would be ~5%.  Or since 2000, its just under 9%.
