Absolutely not.\n\nShould low ranking members of our military be able to break the chain of command and release classified information without punishment?  Probably not.  \n\n&gt;If we blur those lines then we've all but eliminated free speech and the built-in system of checks-and-balances it's suppose to foster.\n\nThe Supreme Court has ruled that classified information is exempt from first amendment protection, especially when it compromises national security.  Whether or not Manning's release jeopardized national security is up for debate, but I think it's unreasonable that classifying information is a first amendment violation.  \n\n_______________________________________\n\nUltimately, I think that Manning was trying to do the right thing in the wrong way.  Clear breaches of the chain of command and respect for secure information are a serious issue that can needlessly jeopardize the lives of Americans at home and abroad.  \n\nThe issue of improper usage of the ability to classify information should be addressed.  Ultimately, I think it should be the responsibility of democratically elected representatives to provide better oversight of the pentagon.  Bradley Manning overstepped his authority, broke the chain of command, and created a precedent where an Army Private played judge and jury over what classified information should be made public.  To me, that is a frightening thing.  \n\nThough he was not treasonous, he acted illegally and with questionable judgement.  As much as I appreciate the information that was released (it affirmed many of my suspicions and provided political ammunition for causes I support), I seriously question the manner in which the information was obtained and released.

If common household goods can be printed, what happens to manufacturers?  What about the dock workers who import and export those goods?  What about the truck driver who brings those goods to the retail shops?  What about the retail workers who count on having goods to sell?  \n\nLike it or not, manufacturing, transporting and selling cheap consumer goods (the kind of goods that can be made using a 3D printer) creates the economic environment that supports our lower and middle classes.  3D printers pose a real and substantial threat to people and communities that count on that kind of activity.\n\nPrinters may make for a more \"efficient\" economy, but that doesn't mean it will be good for society.  Even if we adapt in the long term, the short term consequences of a rapid shift would be devastating.  \n\nSo how do we stop this?\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is a tax on the printing materials. By upping the costs of the raw materials used in printers, we could make it possible for traditional businesses to compete.  \n\nRegulate the types of products that can be produced on machines.  Things like weapons and vehicles should be regulated for safety reasons.  Other consumer goods should be forced to meet the same standard as competing off-the-shelf goods. \n\nHarsh penalties for pirates and copyright thieves.  You can make the case that when it comes to media, you would not have consumed the product if not for piracy.  When you're talking about a real, durable good, it's far more likely that printing instead of purchasing would truly hurt the IP holders. \n\n", "id": "t1_c9v1y21", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "ChangloriousBastard", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1dy2vv", "id": "t1_c9v23c6", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Brandwins", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1dy2vv", "selftext": "That's the tricky part.

As you probably know, inflation (at least on its own) is not a bad thing.  Inflation is a natural result of a growing economy.  \n\nI think it's better to look at hyperinflation not from the perspective of just increasing the amount of money in circulation, but as a way that currency producers effectively devalue currency.  By printing ridiculous amounts of money, you can devalue everyone else's money and make it so that you, as the producer, have such a high volume of the currency that it's actually worth something.  This allows the currency producers to actually buy the things they need/want.  \n\nNon-fiat currencies wouldn't do much to solve that problem.  Devaluing currency and printing money for yourself is not the only way to hoard wealth.  Sure, you could take what little value you have left with your currency and use it to buy gold, but then you're still left with a struggling economy, debts and no easy tool to calm markets.

If you can identify basic facts about the candidates and ballot measures, your vote would be counted. If you cannot, your vote would be ignored (on an item-by-item basis).\n\nI have some major problems with this -- First, it would be incredibly challenging to find a baseline by which we can measure \"basic facts\".  Is it just names, or do we include policy?  \n\nFurther, I find that there is great value in the endorsement process.  I am extremely politically active, but I know next to nothing about the local politics that affect me.  I do, however, belong to a few groups that do make endorsements.  I have faith in the diligence undertaken by members in the group when they make their endorsing decisions.  I may not know particular candidates, but I know that they have been deemed worthy by groups who represent my interests.  Would I be disqualified for voting in those elections because I'm not well versed in that particular race?  \n\nAdditionally, I know that political coalitions are important.  I vote for a certain political party over another because I believe that having that party in the majority of the legislature makes it more likely that my interests will be better represented.  In that sense, isn't party preference reason enough to vote?  \n\n&gt; But not because they're poor, mind you.\n\nThis is irrelevant.  Underrepresentation of certain communities is detrimental to a functioning republic.  Regardless of the cause, the effect is bad news.  \n\n&gt; What's the value in allowing a person to vote who doesn't understand the issue they're voting on?\n\nBecause the people who are voting deal with the consequences of their vote.

I don't think overreaching government surveillance is nearly as likely as overreaching corporate surveillance.  \n\nAs we migrate increasing amounts of sensitive or private information and activities into digital environments, society seems more than willing to surrender their privacy to corporate interests.  As much as government intrusion may frighten me, I think the information is potentially much more dangerous in private hands.  \n\nAs an example, Google is dangerously good at monitoring an individual, mining relevant information and generating a target that they then sell to advertisers.  In a very literal sense, Google manipulates the way that I access information to provide marketers a successful way to predict my purchasing behaviors. Facebook operates in a similar fashion, but they also have the ability to leverage my personal relationships to provide an even more appealing target to marketers.  \n\nThough this may seem like benign activity (after all, what difference do a few ads make?), but I worry about what the long term effects will be.  As marketers become better and better at understanding the nuance of web based marketing (manufactured viral events, social leveraging, etc.), they increase the way that they can effect widespread social behaviors.  \n\nDo targeted ads desensitize young people to the perils of consumerism and a high-debt lifestyle?  Can subtle, targeted ad campaigns change political ideologies?

Additionally, the legislature has a process that it can use to also put legislation on the ballot.  In any given election, there are ~10 initiatives on the ballot. \n\nNearly everyone who pays attention to the process would tell you that it has been extremely detrimental to the process.  \n\nWith the exception of last year's Prop 30 (a tax on the wealthy to pay for education), Californians have voted to lower their tax burden.  This wouldn't be so bad if they weren't also voting for costly government programs.  \n\nOne example of a tax shedding initiative was Prop. 13, which essentially put a property tax freeze in place.  Decades later, large corporations and mega-farms have exploited the frozen tax rate to hold property for much cheaper than a competitor could.  This has lead to an unfair market advantage while also contributing to the budget pinch the capitol faces.\n\nBeyond the financial implications of the proposition system, the direct democracy has failed to bring any meaningful social reform.  Prop 8 banned gay marriage.  Prop 19 (marijuana legalization) failed despite a pot-friendly voting population because of intense lobbying by police groups, corrections groups and medical marijuana dispensaries.  There has yet to be any meaningful moves made on immigration reform, which seems crazy in this state.  \n\n\n\n", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "ChangloriousBastard", "id": "t1_c8zmvp9", "parent_id": "t3_1an7mn", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431654760, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1an7mn", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8zmvp9", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1363845443", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}

Crucial issues like campaign finance reform, government's role in the market, executive authority, consumer rights and personal privacy all seem to float around a constitutional grey area that's subject to a politically motivated and slow moving supreme court.  \n\nThe only solution I can see is either a slew of amendments or a complete revision of the constitution.  In an ideal world, I'd take a complete revision. \n\nUnfortunately, I cannot fathom a process that could generate a modern constitution.  When congress cannot pass a simple spending bill, how can we expect it to write a text that will dictate how government can and will function for the foreseeable future?  Do we pass it on to the states and hope for a 3/4th ratification rate?  Do you think that people in Vermont will remotely agree with anything that Alabama might support?  \n\nUltimately, we're stuck with what we have.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_19sgla", "selftext": "Thanks for the thoughtful and detailed response. I really appreciate you taking the time to illustrate your point in such a clear way.  \n\n______________\n&gt; I would, however, ask why you feel that having the money forcibly taken from your paycheck is a better solution than you investing it yourself.\n\nIf there was an investment vehicle I trusted more than Social Security on both the micro and macro level, I might be more willing to abandon SS.  Unfortunately, I just don't see the private market as a viable competitor to Social Security.  \n\nOn the micro level, Social Security carries much less risk than pretty much any other investment opportunity available to me.  Even though my 401(k) and IRA have been growing at a decent pace, I understand that there's a small but not-insignificant chance that they could be wiped out before I retire.  \n\nSocial Security is structured in a way that makes it much more capable of weathering downturns in the economy.  Assuming we make minor reforms (increase the cap, push back the age, and adjust COLA rates), it's fair to assume that Social Security will at least provide a modest income once I retire.  \n\nIt may not be the sexiest investment opportunity, but when it comes to guaranteed retirement income nothing can compete with the reliability of Social Security.  \n\nOn the macro level, I think SS is absolutely essential.  I was savvy enough and disciplined enough to start investing in my retirement in my early 20s (I'm 24 now, but I started my 401(k) a few years ago), but I understand that many other citizens were either unable or unwilling to make the same decision.  \n\nIgnoring the moral or ethical implications of welfare, I think there is financial incentive for me to make sure that the elderly have decent income and decent healthcare.  Social Security payments typically have a [positive economic effect] (http://srdc.msstate.edu/socialsecurity/files/2011_11_socsecurityimpact.pdf), and play a major role in growing the US economy. \n\nGoing back to your question, I view SS as an investment that can do things that private investment cannot.  Even if I \"overpay\" into SS (assuming my lifetime buy-in exceeds my lifetime payout), I still see it as a sound investment.  If the amount of my overpayment is the penalty that I have to pay to have a reliable retirement option and for the US to have a strong economic driver, I'm fine with that.  \n\n&gt;While I can agree that federal spending does stimulate the economy to some extent, it suffers an execution problem.\n\nI won't argue that the US Government has an execution problem.  I just don't agree with your proposed solution in its entirety.  \n\nI will agree that we need to create a more competitive environment when it comes to issuing grants and \"selecting winners\".  If we're propping up businesses and industries without providing incentives to compete, innovate and grow, we've got a problem.  \n\nBeyond that, though, I think we need to seriously reconsider the role of government in certain industries.  Instead of picking winners and losers in the energy game, why have we not nationalized the energy market?  We handed out billions of dollars in tax breaks and subsidies to oil companies, coal producers, corn growers and clean energy manufacturers.  Meanwhile, these companies have generated huge profits (largely on the back of taxpayers).  \n\nInstead of picking winners and losers, we should turn energy from a private commodity into a public good.  I doubt you'll ever agree with this idea, but to me it seems like the best possible option.  \n\nCertain industries tend to march quickly towards oligopolies or monopolies, so why do even pretend that the free market will provide optimal results?  \n\n&gt;I would much rather Texas screw itself up, and I still have the ability to drive 4-5 hours to a neighboring state, retain my citizenship, and get the education I feel is better.\n\nI think you and I will never agree with this. \n\nFirst, a lot of people don't have the economic mobility to be able to uproot and move. \n\nSecond, I feel that society has a responsibility to assure the well-being of every member of that society.  If a kid in Texas (or Missouri or Massachusetts or any other state) gets a second-rate education, I feel that we are collectively liable.  Which leads me to my next point...\n\n&gt;Likewise, I view myself as an American first. Where we differ is in honesty of what that means. American never meant conformity. It always meant individuality.\n\nThis is why we'll never see eye to eye (which is fine).  I care about the collective as much as I care about the individual.  In my opinion, the success of the individual will never mean as much as the success of the whole.  \n\nSure, I may be able to invest money and have a great retirement without medicare.  Sure, I had a great education and a great family life.  Sure, I have a great deal of economic mobility.  In many ways, I have come out on top; if the life is a game of winners and losers, I'm certainly a winner.  \n\nI just don't think that I can measure my life on such narrowly focused accomplishments.  If I haven't contributed to some greater good, I don't think I've really succeeded.  For better or worse, I think a strong federal government is the best vehicle by which we as a society can make shared sacrifices for a shared success.  \n\n_____\n\nAs far as the Texas BEO argument is concerned, I think the case I made was fair.  Maybe I should have specifically targeted radicalism instead of religion, but I don't think my example showcased bigotry.  \n\nWhen I went to school in Texas (k-12), I was not given proper sexual education.  I was also taught that creationism was a valid scientific theory to contrast evolution.  That's a huge failure on the part of the school system, and it was perpetuated by radical ideologists.  \n\nThere is overwhelming evidence that evolution is real and that strong sexual education reduces STDs and teen pregnancies.

I really appreciate you taking the time to illustrate your point in such a clear way.  \n\n______________\n&gt; I would, however, ask why you feel that having the money forcibly taken from your paycheck is a better solution than you investing it yourself.\n\nIf there was an investment vehicle I trusted more than Social Security on both the micro and macro level, I might be more willing to abandon SS.  Unfortunately, I just don't see the private market as a viable competitor to Social Security.  \n\nOn the micro level, Social Security carries much less risk than pretty much any other investment opportunity available to me.  Even though my 401(k) and IRA have been growing at a decent pace, I understand that there's a small but not-insignificant chance that they could be wiped out before I retire.  \n\nSocial Security is structured in a way that makes it much more capable of weathering downturns in the economy.  Assuming we make minor reforms (increase the cap, push back the age, and adjust COLA rates), it's fair to assume that Social Security will at least provide a modest income once I retire.  \n\nIt may not be the sexiest investment opportunity, but when it comes to guaranteed retirement income nothing can compete with the reliability of Social Security.  \n\nOn the macro level, I think SS is absolutely essential.  I was savvy enough and disciplined enough to start investing in my retirement in my early 20s (I'm 24 now, but I started my 401(k) a few years ago), but I understand that many other citizens were either unable or unwilling to make the same decision.  \n\nIgnoring the moral or ethical implications of welfare, I think there is financial incentive for me to make sure that the elderly have decent income and decent healthcare.  Social Security payments typically have a [positive economic effect] (http://srdc.msstate.edu/socialsecurity/files/2011_11_socsecurityimpact.pdf), and play a major role in growing the US economy. \n\nGoing back to your question, I view SS as an investment that can do things that private investment cannot.  Even if I \"overpay\" into SS (assuming my lifetime buy-in exceeds my lifetime payout), I still see it as a sound investment.  If the amount of my overpayment is the penalty that I have to pay to have a reliable retirement option and for the US to have a strong economic driver, I'm fine with that.  \n\n&gt;While I can agree that federal spending does stimulate the economy to some extent, it suffers an execution problem.\n\nI won't argue that the US Government has an execution problem.  I just don't agree with your proposed solution in its entirety.  \n\nI will agree that we need to create a more competitive environment when it comes to issuing grants and \"selecting winners\".  If we're propping up businesses and industries without providing incentives to compete, innovate and grow, we've got a problem.  \n\nBeyond that, though, I think we need to seriously reconsider the role of government in certain industries.  Instead of picking winners and losers in the energy game, why have we not nationalized the energy market?  We handed out billions of dollars in tax breaks and subsidies to oil companies, coal producers, corn growers and clean energy manufacturers.  Meanwhile, these companies have generated huge profits (largely on the back of taxpayers).  \n\nInstead of picking winners and losers, we should turn energy from a private commodity into a public good.  I doubt you'll ever agree with this idea, but to me it seems like the best possible option.  \n\nCertain industries tend to march quickly towards oligopolies or monopolies, so why do even pretend that the free market will provide optimal results?  \n\n&gt;I would much rather Texas screw itself up, and I still have the ability to drive 4-5 hours to a neighboring state, retain my citizenship, and get the education I feel is better.\n\nI think you and I will never agree with this. \n\nFirst, a lot of people don't have the economic mobility to be able to uproot and move. \n\nSecond, I feel that society has a responsibility to assure the well-being of every member of that society.  If a kid in Texas (or Missouri or Massachusetts or any other state) gets a second-rate education, I feel that we are collectively liable.  Which leads me to my next point...\n\n&gt;Likewise, I view myself as an American first. Where we differ is in honesty of what that means. American never meant conformity. It always meant individuality.\n\nThis is why we'll never see eye to eye (which is fine).  I care about the collective as much as I care about the individual.  In my opinion, the success of the individual will never mean as much as the success of the whole.  \n\nSure, I may be able to invest money and have a great retirement without medicare.  Sure, I had a great education and a great family life.  Sure, I have a great deal of economic mobility.  In many ways, I have come out on top; if the life is a game of winners and losers, I'm certainly a winner.  \n\nI just don't think that I can measure my life on such narrowly focused accomplishments.  If I haven't contributed to some greater good, I don't think I've really succeeded.  For better or worse, I think a strong federal government is the best vehicle by which we as a society can make shared sacrifices for a shared success.  \n\n_____\n\nAs far as the Texas BEO argument is concerned, I think the case I made was fair.  Maybe I should have specifically targeted radicalism instead of religion, but I don't think my example showcased bigotry.  \n\nWhen I went to school in Texas (k-12), I was not given proper sexual education.  I was also taught that creationism was a valid scientific theory to contrast evolution.  That's a huge failure on the part of the school system, and it was perpetuated by radical ideologists.  \n\nThere is overwhelming evidence that evolution is real and that strong sexual education reduces STDs and teen pregnancies.

In fact, I would pay more out of my own pocket if it meant expanding Medicare and increasing Social Security benefits. \n\nI personally have paid enough into SS to receive 35-40k a year, when I retire. To me, I do not see a value in me continuing to fund it. I could do much better for myself, and the economy, having those funds, which are taken from me bi-weekly. I can understand and respect that you value SS, and that you would view the expansion of it as a good thing. I would, however, ask why you feel that having the money forcibly taken from your paycheck is a better solution than you investing it yourself. \n\nIn regards to Medicare, I find it to be a very unique issue. I am a Libertarian, so immediately I am going to pull towards a system where the consumer is not shielded from the cost. We are currently taxed to fund Medicaid\\Medicare, where we may not even use it. Someone else will, and I am fine with that, but since the final consumer of those tax dollars may not even be adequately providing care, I am forced to hand money over, by threat of force, to an intermediary, that will channel it to whomever is partnered with them. I would rather see a local, non-profit hospital, that I could give those dollars to, and know that I have helped my own community. I can also hold them accountable if those funds are misspent, since they are not geographically disparate from me. However, with that being said, I have no issues with the US pursuing a true, single-payer system. All available options for medical care in the US, outside of self-pay, do not allow the consumer to make a cost conscious decision. At the very least, with single-payer, there is better cost oversight than even in self-pay.\n\n&gt; Next, I support a healthy military. I think we vastly overspend on our military, but I understand the need for federal military spending. I wish we would cut our military budget and focus elsewhere, but that's a story for another time. \n\nWe may both be thinking the same thing. There is a difference between \"defense\" and \"military\". I have no issues with tax dollars going towards the \"defense\" of this country, whenever it is needed. However, as a strong proponent of states rights, I would argue that, as a country, we may be better served with a return of tax dollars to the states, who could then fund the federal government during a time of declared war. A minimal budget could be preserved for adequate training of our military. By returning the purse strings of war back to the states, you have effectively returned the power to declare war back to Congress. Much of our current efforts in the military have not officially been declared, and that is a travesty.\n\n&gt; Another point to consider is that federal spending is critical to stimulating the economy. Many federal programs had positive ROIs in terms of economic growth, and I support those investments. I tend to align with Keynesian economists when it comes to the role of central banking, fiscal policy, government intervention and federal spending. I think that state and local governments could never replicate the macroeconomic effects of a large federal government.\n\nWhile I can agree that federal spending does stimulate the economy to some extent, it suffers an execution problem. For all intents and purposes, the federal government has been in the business of throwing tax dollars at a particular company, and none of their competitors. This actually does more economic harm, than good. I can explain this better with bullet points, I belive;\n\n* Three companies exist in the Green Widget space, each with est. 50 employees\n* Feds invest $100,000,000.00 in Company A\n* Companies B and C are competitors\n* Company A outlasts B and C, due to the federal funding it received\n* Company A, with no competitors, is now siloed, and begins to stagnate\n* Eventually Company A runs out of funds, and closes its doors due to bankruptcy, or mismanagement\n\nLoss: $100,000,000.00 federal tax dollars, and 150 jobs.\nGain: N/A\n\nIt seems to me that a more sensible approach would be to not allow the federal government to invest tax dollars, but to use them to reimburse for federally-driven initiatives. Here is what I mean; \n\n* Feds want faster, more energy efficient, diesel engine\n* Feds announce a prize to the company that can produce the best one\n* 3 companies exist in the custom diesel space, and all begin working towards this\n* 2 out of 3 companies succeed in meeting the defined requirements\n* The third company, being unsuccessful, closes its doors, having invested all into this single initiative\n* Feds compare both, and issue reward of $100,000,000.00 to the winner.\n* The remaining company that lost, still has a product with market viability, to which it can hone and refine, and sell in competition.\n\nLoss: $100,000,000.00 federal tax dollars, and 50 jobs.\nGain: New engine, 2 stable companies with a product they can deliver to market.\n\n&gt; Beyond those \"hard\" motivations, I think it's important to note that I tend to distrust state and local governments to handle several basic functions. If states were not competing for federal grant money for education and infrastructure, I doubt that many states would meet the standards necessary to have a healthy country. For example, I don't want the Texas BOE to have absolute free-reign on children's education; not when they're corrupted by religious nut-jobs. I want them to at least meet some standards to compete for federal dollars. \n\nYou and I will differ greatly on this. I would much rather Texas screw itself up, and I still have the ability to drive 4-5 hours to a neighboring state, retain my citizenship, and get the education I feel is better. At some point, if Texas is wrong, they will be forced to change curriculum or die of obscurity and be absorbed by other neighboring states, as people who want a livelihood would have already left. That is much more preferrable to me than the \"Zero Tolerance\" absurdity, which was part of a federal initiative, that we currently endure (see link);\n\n[More schools rethinking zero-tolerance discipline stand](http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-06-01/local/35234056_1_zero-tolerance-cases-zero-tolerance-school-discipline)\n\n&gt; I view myself as an American first and as a citizen of my city/state/region second. The welfare, safety and prosperity of someone living across the country is as important to me as someone living next store. A federal government is the only body that can unite the millions of people in this country. \n\nLikewise, I view myself as an American first. Where we differ is in honesty of what that means. American never meant conformity. It always meant individuality. You seem to have no hesitation in knocking Texas for their educational path, which would be fine, if you could point to something showing that Texas would not educate its youth well enough to compete in the modern world. Right now, considering the health of the Texas economy, and that they are a tax contributor (they pay more federal taxes than they actually receive), your argument is not justified, proven concern, but bigotry.\nIt would be akin to someone saying; \n\n&gt; For example, I don't want the Texas BOE to have absolute free-reign on children's education; not when they're corrupted by flaming homosexuals.\n\nAs you can see, all I did was change two words of your sentence.

The Republicans can change their message and leadership til the cows come home, but it wont mean a thing if they don't win races.  By most metrics, the Senate and White House were both in play for the Republicans; the fact that they failed to win either reflects the need for structural change.  \n\nThese are the structural changes I think the Republican Party needs to make if they want to be successful:\n\n- **Better data management** - Obama for America (OFA) did a great job of modernizing the political data process.  The collected, mined and targeted huge amounts of voter files/volunteer lists to create an incredibly powerful tool.  Beyond that, there was a great deal of communication between the various Democratic party groups and their allies to make sure that there was not excessive overlap on targeted groups.  This allowed Democrats on all levels the ability to reach out to voters and insure good turnout.  \n\n    By comparison, the Republicans' data management system [was a joke](http://www.humanevents.com/2012/11/21/hayward-orca-aground-romneys-high-tech-get-out-the-vote-failure/).  From what I hear, there was not a lot of coordination between the various party organizations; Republicans spent election season stepping on each other's toes, reducing the ability for campaigners to maximize the effect of their volunteer efforts. \n\n- **Top-to-bottom integration** - The Democrats have done a great job integrating resources across the board.  Though each organization (OFA, DNC, DCCC, DSCC, State Parties, Local Parties, Strategic Allies) had their own agenda and responsibilities, they were structured in a way that optimized performance.  They may have competed over volunteers and donors, but at the end of the day they worked together to bring Democrats out to vote. \n\n   By comparison, the Republicans have really dropped the ball when it comes to delegation of responsibility.  There seems to be a lot of infighting and unnecessary competition.\n\n- **Better media strategies** -  In 2012, Romney outspent Obama on ads.  Obama was able to run more ads in critical markets.  Obama also appeared to move the polls more with his ads than Romney did with his own.  That can't happen if you want to be successful.  \n\n- **Integrate grassroots activists** - Remember how many passionate people turned out for the Tea Party rallies in 2010?  Why weren't the out knocking on doors on GOTV weekend?  \n\n   The Republican Party needs to find a way to turn passionate voters into passionate volunteers.  One way to do this is to force the Tea Party candidates to play nice with the party.  If Rand Paul, Michelle Bachmann or any other Tea Party member wants to promote the movement, they need to pull their followers into the party.  Whenever it's legally possible, they need to share volunteer lists.  They need to include party material on their mailing lists.  If they want to be a part of the Republican caucus, they need to act like it.

I do agree that the previous AWB had its issues and there were many ways to get around (especially regarding gun cosmetics), but even if a new AWB could not work, there are other things our government can do to help reduce gun violence, including some of the things President Obama has put forward through Executive Action.", "id": "t1_c83hgv5", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "ah102886", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c83cdrm", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1431077300, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c83hgv5", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1359139225", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c836cag", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431074903, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "green", "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c83cdrm", "author_flair_text": "[CPA][Libertarian]", "created_utc": "1359121740", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c835wtb", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431071967, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_175qi7", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c836cag", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1359085995", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c831p3f", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431071801, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "green", "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c835wtb", "author_flair_text": "[CPA][Libertarian]", "created_utc": "1359084639", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c82pf7e", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431069727, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_175qi7", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c831p3f", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1359071251", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

If you have any contacts from your experience campaigning and interning, drop them a line.  Getting your foot in the door is usually the hardest part; If you already have a network in place, you've got a step up on other people.  \n\nRegardless of where you end up (lobbyist, chief of staff, leg aid, consultant), your best bet is to start in the capital.  If the choice comes down to working in a field office or working at the capital, pick the capital; you'll have a much better shot at moving up.\n\nMore than likely, the first job you're going to get in that line of work would be as a field rep.  That means you'll do a lot of constituency/grunt work.  Always look for opportunities to get more involved and move up in the office place.  The legislative environment is extremely competitive.  Work smart, apply yourself and build a large network.  \n\nAlso, be prepared to move and work on campaigns.  I don't know of a single Chief of Staff that doesn't have quality campaign experience.  More often than not, a legislature's office staff evolves into their campaign staff, then folds back in.  \n\nI've noticed that in this field certain qualities help you stand out:\n\n- Dependability.  If you say you're going to do something, you better do it.\n\n- Loyalty.  Though people switch jobs and change tracks often, never betray your allies.  If you screw someone over, it will not be quickly forgotten.\n\n- Ambition. Don't kiss ass, but make sure that others know that you're eager to impress people and move up.  If I have to give a project to two field reps, I'd give it to the one who is most motivated... usually that's the person with ambition.  If you think you should be included in a project, mention it.  If you have talents that could serve your goals, use them.  \n\n- Good appearance.  Wear clothes that fit and make sure you groom yourself well.  I've seen capable people left behind because they don't have the look of a professional.  \n\n- Persistence.  Don't pester people, but treat every interaction as a job interview.  By persistently being on your game, you'll leave people with good impressions.  Also, be prepared to work lots and lots of overtime. \n\n- A solid grasp of numbers.  Politics and legislation are games of numbers.  I don't care if you're a lobbyist, legislative aide or field representative, you better know how to remember and process numbers.  Campaigners need to know and hit their goals.  Leg aides need to know policy-related numbers.  Lobbyists need to know their industry, and know the bottom line of legislatures.  If you're uncomfortable with numbers, you better fix that quickly.  \n\n- Sociability.  Skill will only get you so far in the world of politics.  If you can charm people, you will progress; it's as simple as that. \n", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "ChangloriousBastard", "id": "t1_c7v9lz5", "parent_id": "t3_16eawe", "score": 6, "retrieved_on": 1435646598, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7v9lz5", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357940535", "distinguished": null, "ups": 6}
{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "There are many different roads you can take, but some routes work better than others:\n\nFirst, understand that districts have unique profiles.  Some districts have well established political networks; unless you come from the inside, you'll never establish the institutional support to field a successful campaign. Other districts tend to shun \"insider\" politicians and would never elect someone with strong partisan ties.  \n\nLooking at the candidates I saw recruited by the state party, certain trends emerge:\n\n- Most were successful outside of politics. We had multiple doctors, educators and small business owners.  Though a few of them had political experience, their non-political achievements were highlighted more than their political achievements \n\n- Most were exceptional, independent fundraisers.\n\n- Though they were \"political outsiders\", most had strong relationships with the political community.  \n\nFrom these trends, I can offer the following advice:\n\n- Be active in the community.  If you're a lawyer, do work for local organizations.  Volunteer.  Raising your profile will help create a resume that you can sell to voters.\n\n- Build a fundraising network.  As a lawyer, meet other politically active lawyers.  Build a network that you can call upon once you start running.  If you can prove fundraising savvy, you'll see institutional support follow suit.  \n\n- Donate to political allies if you can. Before you even run, bundle together some money from your network and direct it to the Speaker or Senate Pro Tem.  If you prove your viability to them, you'll be rewarded in the future.  \n\n- Get to know your local party.  Give them money if you can.  Join if makes sense.  If you can build allies pre-primary, you'll be in a good position.  \n\n- Stay out of trouble.  Research is so much easier than it used to be, so it's nearly impossible to keep secrets.  \n\n- When it comes time to run, pick a good manager/consultant.  It may cost your campaign a premium, but it will pay off.  Mismanaged campaigns rarely win.
