Hell we have a base in Cuba! You really think the DPRK collapses we are going to close all our bases on the Korean peninsula and Japan?

Above all the last one people probably vastly underestimate. It would take *decades* before North Korea could really integrate with South Korea.

Also generally figures don't show majority support for *legalisation* they show majority support for *decriminalisation* which is different. You can get figures that prove either side of the argument has the majority support though.\n\nAs for the majority support thing, in the US during the civil rights movement there was only a minority at the start willing to do anything to support civil rights, and most people were \"on the fence\".

In the 40's, 50', 60's, and even into the 70's, pretty much the rest of the industrialized world was still dealing with the after affects of WWII. The US for all intents and purposes came out of the war unscathed, everybody else suffered varying degrees of infrastructure damage, productive loss as a result of their populations being killed or wounded, or the general disarray that a major war causes. It takes a long time, a generation, to truly recover from such an event (if not more). So when people look back at how dominant the US was back during those decades, that is a major reason for the dominance. \n\nAll that said, there are some issues that need to be dealt with, mostly political issues. The constant fighting over fiscal and economic issues certainly isn't helping the country and our political system seems incapable of passing major forward thinking legislation. It seems likely that the only two major legislative accomplishments we will see under Obama is health care reform and immigration reform (if the House republicans don't kill the bill the senate just passed). That's not much for nearly a decade in office. I think the issue extends beyond the two major political parties, it just seems that innovative thinking isn't rewarded. The way the news cycle seems to work right now is an innovative idea is either drowned out/ignored because it takes to long to explain or ruthlessly picked apart. There is of course a path to success, but it comes with a risk larger than many politicians are willing to wager. So instead we will only get small tweaks or half measures until a major issue/problem arises. \n\nReally the only thing anybody needs to be worried about is environmental issues. As we prevent the collapse of the environment from causing the collapse/serious regression of human civilization, then eventually things will work themselves out.

Yea, that's a win. \n\n&gt;No, actually, he didn't. It's still in the shitter.\n\nThe economy could had been far, far worse, as in great depression levels worse. While there are other factors contributing to the our relatively low unemployment numbers, they are still far better than in the PIGS nations which have 20%+ unemployment numbers. So while yes, the US economy could be better, it could also be worse. Also I would like to remind you that the republicans in Congress have done quite literally everything in their power to thwart the recovery. Believe it our not, when it comes to domestic issues the president can do little without the consent on Congress. \n\n&gt;No, he forced them to buy something that, I, personally cannot afford. What's next, tax people for not owning homes?\n\nIf you cannot afford it then you either get a subsidy, qualify for medicaid, or won't have to pay the penalty. Certainly there are some people out there who may fall into a \"doughnut hole\" in which the ACA ends up costing them more, unfortunately that is going to happen with ever massive legislative effort like the ACA. Even if we accept that the ACA is making your buy insurance you cannot afford, which personally I think is dubious, overall the ACA has/will improve the American health care system. It sure as hell doesn't fix it, but it has improved it for a lot of people. \n\n&gt;Can't speak to that. Unless you're talking about the meddling he did in the car industry, which hasn't exactly worked out as promised (CARS was a flustercluck)\n\nNo... Just no... GM and Chrysler were in bankruptcy and there wasn't enough private capital out there at the time to keep them from shutting down. Had GM and Chrysler truly gone under it could had devastated the American economy as it might had well ruined the entire auto industry, even Ford and the US subsidies of foreign companies, because supply manufactures might well had gone under as well because of loss of business. Sure the Obama administration could had handled it better, but the world doesn't stop when important decisions have to be made. Again like with the economy you must consider the alternative of inaction which *would* had been far worse. \n\n&gt;Thereby interfering in foreign nation's affairs without any authorization, only to let one of our consulates in the country be attacked and our ambassador murdered...? Yeah, that was a real deft move.\n\nThat's just plain silly. The US government along with NATO prevent a humanitarian crisis from occurring by intervening in Libya. Even if we accepted there was a necessary connection between our intervention in Libya and the attack on the US consulate, which I don't accept that there is, I'm sure if asked those four American's killed would be fine trading their lives for the thousands we possibly saved by our intervention. \n\n&gt;But you're right, there are a few things he's done: He renewed the patriot act, authorized indefinite detention of US citizens on US soil, \n\nAll these enjoyed veto proof support in congress. Obama would had obliterated has political capital had he vetoed these bills. \n\n&gt;what else, decided to outright murder people (including US Citizens) \n\nIn time we will perhaps have a better idea of the effects of Obama's foreign policy decisions, particularly when it comes to the issue of using military force against suspected terrorist targets. It is certainly within the realm of possibility that the \"Obama doctrine\" of decisive and often clandestine usage of military force against suspected terrorist targets will come back to haunt us. However there are no \"easy solutions\" when it comes to international terrorism. Cruel calculus is often involved, kill 5 civilians in a strike and maybe you save 10 down the road. Fine you can sit there on your high horse of morality and say \"no more drone strikes ever\" but what happens when terrorist group in the hills of Pakistan, no longer fearing drone strikes, is able to plan and launch an operation to steal a nuclear weapon from a Pakistani military installation? Even if the terrorists never get an opportunity to set off the stolen nuke it will cause an unholy shit storm to occur as damn near every nation in the world will do everything in their power to stop the terrorist from setting off their nuke. And you know what there are going to be a lot of while all this is going on? Civilian deaths. \n\nOf course I'm not saying that this scenario *will* happen or that drone strikes may not very well in the long run might cause this situation to occur, however despite the failures of Obama's foreign policy doctrine in this area, it has thus far seem to be effective in keeping terrorist organizations destabilized. \n\n&gt;rather than capturing them and putting them in Limbo at Gitmo (which he's not done a fucking thing about, by the way).\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1dgtns/obama_guantanamo_is_not_necessary_to_keep_america/c9q9mbv\n\n", "id": "t1_c9qu2n3", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Scaryclouds", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c9qppza", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431352418, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1dhhsl", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9qu2n3", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1367472061", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c9qpfmy", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431354468, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1dhhsl", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9qppza", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1367459031", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c9qjvzt", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431354604, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Really?

Yea, that's a win. \n\n&gt;No, actually, he didn't. It's still in the shitter.\n\nThe economy could had been far, far worse, as in great depression levels worse. While there are other factors contributing to the our relatively low unemployment numbers, they are still far better than in the PIGS nations which have 20%+ unemployment numbers. So while yes, the US economy could be better, it could also be worse. Also I would like to remind you that the republicans in Congress have done quite literally everything in their power to thwart the recovery. Believe it our not, when it comes to domestic issues the president can do little without the consent on Congress. \n\n&gt;No, he forced them to buy something that, I, personally cannot afford. What's next, tax people for not owning homes?\n\nIf you cannot afford it then you either get a subsidy, qualify for medicaid, or won't have to pay the penalty. Certainly there are some people out there who may fall into a \"doughnut hole\" in which the ACA ends up costing them more, unfortunately that is going to happen with ever massive legislative effort like the ACA. Even if we accept that the ACA is making your buy insurance you cannot afford, which personally I think is dubious, overall the ACA has/will improve the American health care system. It sure as hell doesn't fix it, but it has improved it for a lot of people. \n\n&gt;Can't speak to that. Unless you're talking about the meddling he did in the car industry, which hasn't exactly worked out as promised (CARS was a flustercluck)\n\nNo... Just no... GM and Chrysler were in bankruptcy and there wasn't enough private capital out there at the time to keep them from shutting down. Had GM and Chrysler truly gone under it could had devastated the American economy as it might had well ruined the entire auto industry, even Ford and the US subsidies of foreign companies, because supply manufactures might well had gone under as well because of loss of business. Sure the Obama administration could had handled it better, but the world doesn't stop when important decisions have to be made. Again like with the economy you must consider the alternative of inaction which *would* had been far worse. \n\n&gt;Thereby interfering in foreign nation's affairs without any authorization, only to let one of our consulates in the country be attacked and our ambassador murdered...? Yeah, that was a real deft move.\n\nThat's just plain silly. The US government along with NATO prevent a humanitarian crisis from occurring by intervening in Libya. Even if we accepted there was a necessary connection between our intervention in Libya and the attack on the US consulate, which I don't accept that there is, I'm sure if asked those four American's killed would be fine trading their lives for the thousands we possibly saved by our intervention. \n\n&gt;But you're right, there are a few things he's done: He renewed the patriot act, authorized indefinite detention of US citizens on US soil, \n\nAll these enjoyed veto proof support in congress. Obama would had obliterated has political capital had he vetoed these bills. \n\n&gt;what else, decided to outright murder people (including US Citizens) \n\nIn time we will perhaps have a better idea of the effects of Obama's foreign policy decisions, particularly when it comes to the issue of using military force against suspected terrorist targets. It is certainly within the realm of possibility that the \"Obama doctrine\" of decisive and often clandestine usage of military force against suspected terrorist targets will come back to haunt us. However there are no \"easy solutions\" when it comes to international terrorism. Cruel calculus is often involved, kill 5 civilians in a strike and maybe you save 10 down the road. Fine you can sit there on your high horse of morality and say \"no more drone strikes ever\" but what happens when terrorist group in the hills of Pakistan, no longer fearing drone strikes, is able to plan and launch an operation to steal a nuclear weapon from a Pakistani military installation? Even if the terrorists never get an opportunity to set off the stolen nuke it will cause an unholy shit storm to occur as damn near every nation in the world will do everything in their power to stop the terrorist from setting off their nuke. And you know what there are going to be a lot of while all this is going on? Civilian deaths. \n\nOf course I'm not saying that this scenario *will* happen or that drone strikes may not very well in the long run might cause this situation to occur, however despite the failures of Obama's foreign policy doctrine in this area, it has thus far seem to be effective in keeping terrorist organizations destabilized. \n\n&gt;rather than capturing them and putting them in Limbo at Gitmo (which he's not done a fucking thing about, by the way).\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1dgtns/obama_guantanamo_is_not_necessary_to_keep_america/c9q9mbv\n\n", "id": "t1_c9qu2n3", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Scaryclouds", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c9qppza", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431352418, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1dhhsl", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9qu2n3", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1367472061", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c9qpfmy", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431354468, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1dhhsl", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9qppza", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1367459031", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c9qjvzt", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431354604, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Really?

Additionally congresspersons can be coerced into voting or not voting on a bill out of fear of being the target of a smear campaign. \n\nSo while I'm not arguing against your proposals, and indeed they really do solve some problems, the core issue \"threatening our democracy\" would be to reform campaign financing. Not only limiting how much and from where a politician can bring in money (directly and indirectly). But indeed limiting how much money can spent for political purposes during an election cycle/campaign. Of course it is easier said than done.

Do you chant USA! USA! while you write.\n\nOy vey. Talk about rhetoric... But I guess you Googled a few Wikipedia pages. You must know what you're talking about.\n\n&gt;The US spending on defence is 700 billion a year. So tell me again how spending on the UN is why the US spends so much more?\n\nI wasn't implying that the UN or NATO funding was the only reason why the US defense budget is so large. I was using them as examples of how the US supplements the rest of the world's defense spending. Aside from the UN and NATO, the US also spends billions of dollars training and equipping foreign troops.\n\nIn FY 2010 alone the US spent [nearly $7 billion *a month*](http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL33110.pdf) in Afghanistan training Afghan soldiers, building military infrastructure, housing, fuel, equipment, etc. About $50 billion has gone directly to equipping and training Afghan soldiers, which suggests there is something seriously amiss with your magical Wikipedia'd numbers of $50 billion for US Armed Forces equipment, total. (Unless you believe that the US is pouring 100% of its equipment budget into a foreign army, leaving its own soldiers without.)\n\n&gt;Here's your foreign military financing: 4.5 billion dollars.\n\nForeign Military Financing =/= military aid. The FMF program facilitates US arms deals with other nations, usually through grants and loans. Foreign military aid, on the other hand, is a term which envelopes FMF, IMET, and other less specific costs such as projects undertaken by the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs (which is technically overseen by the DoS, but whose projects are funded by the DoD).\n\n&gt;Countries you're actually spending most of your money on: The ones you're blowing up and Israel, not any part of Europe.\n\nIf you take a second to look, you'll notice that the DoD dedicates the largest portion of its budget (41%) to facility operations and maintenance. According to the [Base Structure Report (FY 2012)](http://www.acq.osd.mil/ie/download/bsr/BSR2012Baseline.pdf):\n\n&gt;The DoD manages a worldwide real property portfolio that spans all 50 states, seven U.S. territories, and 40 foreign countries. The majority of the foreign sites are located in Germany (232 sites), Japan (109 sites), and South Korea (85 sites).\n\nStrange. Japan and South Korea? I could have sworn I said the US subsidized their defense heavily before... And Germany? I'm just a jingoistic American so I can't be sure, but I'm 95% positive that's a country located somewhere in Europe. Since you might be struggling to understand what I'm saying, I'll try to make it even more clear:\n\nBases take a lot of dough to operate, maintain, staff, and supply. The majority of oversees bases are in Europe. (200+ in Germany, 30+ in Great Britain, 10+ in Portugal, 6 in Norway, and others...) All those European countries are members of NATO. The US gives the largest amount of money to peacekeeping forces of NATO, and also operates, maintains, and garrisons over 300 military facilities in Europe. If you're a European member state of NATO and have an ally with the most powerful military on the planet already hanging out in your backyard, chances are you don't need to spend much on defense (because if you were attacked, said ally with the bases and troops everywhere would be obligated to defend you).\n\n**TL;DR:** The US has a defense budget larger than the next 13 countries combined because those 13 other countries don't pay for all their friends' guns, like the US does.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c9n1sty", "parent_id": "t1_c9mwcku", "score": -4, "retrieved_on": 1431421666, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Right.

And given that the article you site is from 2010 a lot of that is still **fighting**. If you'd like to completely change your argument to \"we're paying a lot for the wars we started\" you go right ahead, but don't pretend proving that proves the argument you've been making all along. \n\nBases do take money and you're totally right about the 41% of the defense budget the US puts into that. You kind of leave out that your own document, the base structure report, shows that there are only 660 bases overseas but there are 4500 bases in the US. So the bases overseas make up, let's be generous to you, only 1/8 of total bases. So out of the 41% of the budget we're talking about (and assuming it is all spent on bases) there is only 1/8 of that being spent on overseas bases. So only about 5% of the total budget is spent on overseas bases. \n\n**If the US closed every single overseas base it would still spend more than the next 13 countries combined.**\n\n**TL;DR** Nice that you have some facts, but you're bad at math.  \n\nP.S. The next country on the list, the one right after the US, is China. We're not supplying China with weapons or military cover.

Gun owners are living in a dream world if they think an event like Newtown can happen and for their to be no response. Yes I realize \"assault weapons\" is a nebulous term, that relatively few people are killed by the weapons used by Jeremy Holmes and Adam Lanza, and massacres in general are rare. Still at the end of the day you can't expect the political response to a school massacre to be indifference, the voting public, particularly on the democratic side, demands a response.\n\nFurther it is complicated to say rather Obama is \"using up his political capital.\" Among republicans and democrats in more conservative districts, yes definitely (though he seems to have very little political capital with republicans anyways), but among more liberal/urban democrats he is definitely gaining political capital. Passing some sort of major gun reform would help energize democrats and independents who favor gun control. \n\nIf Obama and the democrats are able to push through a significant gun control bill than over all they will have increased their political capital because most Americans want some sort gun control and it also shows competence/follow through on Obama's part.

The field of psychology has clearly shown humans are not entirely rational entities.

Most consumers knowing this would opt to purchase the more expensive, but safer meat. However it is unlikely, without some outside agency that tests food products, consumers would ever make the connection between seller A's meat and cancer due to cancers nature of taking a long time to develop and being the result of multiple factors. \n\nTL:DR;\n\nHow do Austrian Economists respond to consumers acting irrationally based upon limited information?

You could shoot your foot or shit your pants, as long as its not instinctually or accidentally, it is a rational action for the purposes of economics. There's no such thing as 'irrational behavior' in economics.(Sneezing or other instinctual things would be \"non-rational\" rather than \"irrational\").\n\n2) When common people use the word 'rational', they mean 'sane'. Shooting yourself in the foot is clearly an irrational behavior. Changing jobs for better money is a rational behavior. The way you're using the term 'rational', you mean this meaning.\n\nAlso keep one thing in mind, we only study the rational actions(as in 'intentional' actions) of individuals, not every action performed by an individual needs to be intentional. As far as we know the market prices aren't formed unintentionally, the cities and dams aren't build unintentionally. So we can use economics to study them by using human action axiom.\n\n&gt; how do Austrian economists respond to lack of information on the part of consumers when making a purchase\n\nOne thing needs to be ensured that there's a big difference between \"stated preference\" and \"demonstrated preference\". You may say that you like to take a vacation in Swiss Alpes, but when the summer time comes in and you take a vacation in Mexico because the tickets were cheaper, then your stated preference might be to take vacation in switzerland, but your demonstrated preference was to prefer vacation in Mexico + have more money to spend on other things. \n\nIf you are buying a car, and you don't bother to get an check done by a trained mechanic then all that means is that you value \"shorter buying consideration + risky car purchase\" more than \"longer buying consideration time + less risky car purchase\".\n\nBoth the transactions are equally valid and sensible from the viewpoint of economics. And both make the actor equally happy(apriori or before the fact). Later one might regret buying a lemon car and not getting a car thoroughly reviewed, but that doesn't matter because its a different individual at that point(in time).\n\nEven if you truly believe that the meat you're gonna buy is gonna get you cancer but you still buy it, then that means you value that meat more than the risk associated with it(see even in your example you give a reason behind a consumer buying a carcinogenic meat, because its cheaper).\n\nPlus your example isn't even on the mark. If you don't know that the house you're buying is built on an earthquake fault line, how is that 'irrational' behavior? You are buying a house which you truly believe is a great house and is NOT built upon an earthquake fault line.\n\nHow is ignorance allows you to qualify an action as \"irrationality\"? Wouldn't it be irrational if you KNEW that your house is built upon an earthquake fault line and you still bought it?(I would still disagree with you, but at least right now your own example doesn't make any sense).\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18qopd", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8huj92", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361289753", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c8h6kw1", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431336103, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18qopd", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8hme8h", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361246395", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

A politician in a deeply red district cannot vote for gun control and not be under serious risk on losing his seat. A politician in a deeply blue cannot vote to weaken unions. The above proposals should generally favor politicians who are more moderate and/or reflecting of a broader range of opinions in his district.

Elections could become publicly funded, but that won't necessarily dissuade extreme candidates from running. At most it would lessen the impact they have on the campaign cycle. \n\n3. Instant-runoff voting would only be a viable solution in smaller, more local elections where multiple viable candidates ran (e.g. jungle primaries in Louisiana). These tend to be less salient elections, though, and are more likely to attract local voters with an active interest in the community, who probably know better than other voters anyway. \n\n4. Open primaries would weaken the control people have over their party. I certainly would not want a Tea Party of Republicans infiltrating my party's primary and pushing a John Kerry ahead of a Hilary Clinton or a Barack Obama. The reason primaries were turned over to the voters in the first place was to give control to the party-in-the-electorate. Open primaries would weaken that control. \n\nRedistricting would, at least in part, weaken the control extremist politicians have over their districts and would lead to more competitive districts (as in more of them, not ones that are more competitive.)
