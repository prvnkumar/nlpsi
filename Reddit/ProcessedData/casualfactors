There was a time when there was vigorous debate about how a program like would be run and paid for, and whether it was good for the country, but once it was enacted and people started getting cheques a politician couldn't reasonably argue on a national stage that they should be taken away.  Even your food stamp example, while particularly egregious (I hadn't heard the 40 billion number, I thought it was much less than that), only reduces a benefit that was artificially inflated during the stimulus.  It would be much different if someone suggested ending that program all together, the debate on the merits of SNAP is not whether it should be repealed, but how best to administer and pay for it.\n\nAn attempt to completely repeal the ACA once it's implemented in a significant way would mean directly removing coverage from persons who were covered by that act's policies.  The media would have dozens of stories of families with terrible illnesses who would be exposed to an unsympathetic insurance market if the ACA were repealed, politicians would run on the plank that (Candidate X) wants to take away your health coverage, the voting public would be asked to balance the needs of sick families against the anomalous idea of cost and deficit and debt.  \n\n*See Cindy-Lou over there?

It's very expensive to be sick and uninsured in this country.  Vote for me, Keith Douglas, I'll fight every day to make sure you and your family never have to worry about losing your health coverage because some bureaucrat in an insurance office decides you're not worth the risk, or you lose your job in these troubled times, or you have a pre-existing condition, so you can enjoy the things that really matter.*  [Shot of little blond girl, running with kite across open field, sunny day, parents smiling] \n\nLastly it's just basic psychology that you can get away with not giving people something much more easily than you can take something away from them.

Republicans will want costs controls and limits on funding and coverage, benefits for business and tax loopholes to spur growth, Democrats will want to expand coverage and regulation and use leverage to reduce costs and prices, and there will be an endless tug-of-war over how the program is run, and while there will still be Tea Party voices demanding its repeal it'll be mostly for show, without any ability to move the national consciousness.  I still can't believe that with a majority in the house and Senate, and a Democrat in the WH, they didn't put together a single-payer system.

The two lingering accomplishments of his presidency, therefore, are not looked on fondly. Bush's response to 9/11 is the massive, bloated government surveillance industry people are now all upset over.\n\nIt is also important to remember that he had many more ideas that he failed to push through. The Administration did announce a strategy to privatize Social Security that went no where. Republicans in Congress fought lengthy regulatory battles with the EPA and SEC to effectively gut their ability to regulate much of anything, that Democrats successfully blocked.\n\nI believe that the war in Iraq was an enormous mistake that will hamper American foreign policy for decades, and that by imposing a massive deficit increase in the form of a politically irrevocable tax cut, the Bush Presidency really does stand as one of our worst. Bush as a President mostly failed to get much done, but where he succeeded, we are still suffering the consequences.\n\nIt is important to note that George Bush himself seemed to have very few ideas of his own about governance. I think he was mostly an empty vessel into which his administration could pour policy focus. He was mostly subjected to the whims of the conservative interests that put him in office.

Most of the terrorists that the United States and Israel face are imports from Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Lebanon, which are countries whose local political cultures are more likely to view terrorism and suicide terrorism as effective means to an end. Indeed, most suicide terrorists are not from the oppressed poor - they are college-educated men from countries whose political relationship with the United States is far more complicated than \"oppressor/oppressed.\"\n\nThe organizations that produce terrorists are complicated sociopolitical groups with roles in the government, social welfare services, healthcare services, religious provisions, protest movements and militaries of the countries in which they reside. Their actions are determined by the power struggles amongst their leadership and their desire to expand their own organization's influence. The ability to strike and kill Americans signals political efficacy to certain financial donors and infrastructure providers - wealthy ideologues in Tehran and Islamabad, Beirut and Damascus, Jakarta and Cairo, etc. Other activities serve other ends. Ha'mas provides social welfare in Gaza, Hezbollah provides hospitals and clinics in Syria and Lebanon, the Taliban provides madrassahs throughout Afghanistan and Pakistan, al Qaeda in the Maghreb provides schools and private gang-like private security in Algeria for much the same reasons: to establish political legitimacy to attain power in the future.\n\nThe tendency of political commentators to treat the incentives of the world's terrorist organizations as those of a Manichean struggle between the evil Western Empire and the Caliphate is to the detriment of us all. All such groups are engaged in local political struggles that define the strategies they pursue. If their resource base is happy to see them cause chaos amongst the Americans, that is what they do. If it is better for them to delegitimize the government of Pakistan with a parallel educational system, that is what they do.\n\nTerrorist organizations function as everything from political parties to local militias at the same time.

The battle for the Federal Reserve, a fifty-year struggle by Presidents who kept being defeated by their own parties in Congress, represents the disparity between the national offices and the local offices of the parties. Woodrow Wilson was only able to get it done when the southwest seats flipped to the Democrats and gave him enough votes outside the South to create the Fed.\n\nThe third reason is difficult to understand in the modern era. The third reason that state parties used to be powerful is because the act of running for office used to be viewed as quite unseemly. People did not nominate themselves, give speeches, or even really campaign. As such, local party organizations had to get together, agree on a candidate, nominate him (\"him\" only), and play out the whole false-modesty pretense of the aloof candidate while running the election on his behalf. This was impossible for national parties to coordinate.\n\nToday, however, the opposite is true. Both parties are very candidate-centric, they coordinate nationally and essentially dictate terms to state parties. State party organizations are, at least in the party I worked for, very resentful of the national party despite needing its money to get along. This is simply because elections have become \"more national\" - national-level factors like the economy and nationwide unemployment have become better and better predictors of election outcomes. Money, candidates and expertise flow nationally, and so now the power is at the national level.\n\nOne thing though is that as politics becomes more expensive, candidates become more professional. That is, the \"career politician\" was not common until around the 1970s. That means that politicians now *must* get their start in local or state politics before advancing up the ladder to Congress, the Senate or to the Presidency, and so local kingmakers still have power in that regard. The Democratic Parties of Los Angeles, Chicago, and Boston, and the Republican Parties of Orange County, Richmond, Columbus, and Tallahassee are all rather notorious in that regard. There, local power is still maintained by state and county parties by their ability to pick and choose the rookie candidates.", "id": "t1_cbpabfn", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "casualfactors", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1jzod1", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429803366, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1jzod1", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cbpabfn", "author_flair_text": "[PhD, Former Campaign Tech][Independent]", "created_utc": "1376690567", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

You can see this yourself when you are trying to win an argument, sometimes you ignore certain data or arguments and present only the ones that fit with your opinion.

It can even be good if you have the right system of government to handle it.  It can be good to give voters a clear choice during elections and it can be good to have two opposing arguments being made because it helps clarify the issues.\n\nWhat is bad is having polarized parties in a political system that does not allow voters to change the direction of a country after an election.  In the United States, power is separated between the House, the Senate, and the Executive.  In addition, elections between the different branches of government are staggered so everyone will never be up for reelection at the same time.  So it's possible to have different branches controlled by different parties.  \n\nThis is bad if the parties are very polarized because, if they are rational, they will try very hard to implement the policies they think are right, which means stopping what the other side wants to do.  This leads to occasional constitutional crises, like the government shutdown in the 1990s and the debt ceiling showdown of a couple years ago.  \n\nIn parliamentary democracies, on the other hand, whoever wins the election gets to implement their policies because all legislative and executive power is vested in one body: parliament.  It is up to voters to ratify the majority party's choices by reelecting them or change course by throwing them out at the next election.  In short, presidential republics take more power out of the voters' hands and consolidate it among elites (party leaders who are in theory supposed to work out deals with each other), while parliamentary democracies place more responsibility on voters to choose the right path.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, in the mid-20th century, the parties in the United States were not as polarized (though there were many contentious debates, they did not break down as cleanly along party lines) so it was possible to have a presidential republic work without frequently breaking down.  Now we have modern, ideologically coherent parties, like in Europe, but without a system of government that allows the party who won the most recent election to do what they want and have voters decide whether it is the right path at the next election.  This causes gridlock.\n\nEdit: grammar.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bkjn6", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c99rho8", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1365270354", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "clicked": false, "title": "What's so bad about political polarization?", "media": null, "base10id": 79900530, "id": "t3_1bkjn6", "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 1, "saved": false, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1bkjn6/whats_so_bad_about_political_polarization/", "name": "t3_1bkjn6", "created": 1364969478, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1bkjn6/whats_so_bad_about_political_polarization/", "author_flair_text": "[PhD, Former Campaign Tech][Independent]", "author": "casualfactors", "created_utc": 1364965878, "distinguished": null, "num_comments": 8, "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_16eihd", "selftext": "Actually, the debt was stable and low [until World War II](http://www.ontheissues.org/askme/natdebt.gif) and the mainstream opinion of economists right now is that wartime policies were actually much worse for the economy than the New Deal - in fact, [US military policy in general has historically hurt the economy.](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CEIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Feconlog.econlib.org%2Farchives%2F2012%2F09%2Fhow_economists.html&amp;ei=-qjwUIbiGauUigLQuoGADQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFbjFM0rlnLHb4At4ee-1iqPKiECg&amp;sig2=EjBHB44K_KWCzwyjYz44kQ&amp;bvm=bv.1357700187,d.cGE) I can find no serious economist who would argue that the GI Bill was a failure, nor that the minimum wage hurt the economy. Social security, Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP have together by and large [ended poverty among the elderly and ended malnutrition among the young.](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CEoQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nber.org%2Fbah%2Fsummer04%2Fw10466.html&amp;ei=hKnwUMbpAev4igLk-YC4Aw&amp;usg=AFQjCNExfjNIB-56WI_rRh_fplXgsjRFtg&amp;sig2=m78Ot6MJ0E3OkRtYCjEZBA&amp;bvm=bv.1357700187,d.cGE) Your assessment that the New Deal was a failure is wrong, but largely because you don't have good evidence. The 30s happened to coincide with widespread adoption of the tractor rather than the farmhand as the main unit of doing work in a country where over a third of the population was farmers, creating this thing you may be interested in called \"structural unemployment\" (see: an American economy after a big-computing revolution).\n\nI think there is general agreement, however, that tax cuts by and large have created more debt than they've solved (see the graph above, I suppose). Indeed, rising inequality tacks closely with [rising political polarization, poverty and loss of trust in ones government and neighbors,](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CFEQFjAD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPolarized-America-Ideology-Walras-Pareto-Lectures%2Fdp%2F0262633612&amp;ei=HKrwUKr0I6GyigLQvoHACA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEIHNAZWG4svN3a6X-zsV0ynPZAjw&amp;sig2=VKWTcETSfva6_nrt5PFRVA&amp;bvm=bv.1357700187,d.cGE) and rising inequality is closely related to tax cut policies - though yes, also to policies suggested by lefty economists regarding subsidies (namely, that there should be more of them). Heck, there is even evidence that the radical monetarist idea of [going off the gold standard helped stabilize price levels](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDoQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2F~%2Fmedia%2FProjects%2FBPEA%2F1982%25201%2F1982a_bpea_cooper_dornbusch_hall.PDF&amp;ei=rKvwUJitG4WFiALNrIDwCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHpuhun1DFUAVxTaLUWs1GPxCE_1Q&amp;sig2=gVzKHu3ztlXU3AlpQs-Ewg&amp;bvm=bv.1357700187,d.cGE) and benefited the economy. Deficits by themselves aren't \"bad,\" but it's hard to find inequality that is \"good.\"\n\nYes, I will admit that much of the research on inequality [ignores fringe benefits,](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fceg.berkeley.edu%2Fvisitors_31_3957587764.pdf&amp;ei=S6zwUNnXN8fhiwK1uYHoCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEnKfWuv77fuf_0DqrZ_aMPzuUCIQ&amp;sig2=tIP0a_wDuRP8vyk0aa4xzg&amp;bvm=bv.1357700187,d.cGE) but you can respecify wealth any way you please and still arrive at the inescapable fact that inequality began rising in the US (and around the world) [in the late 1970s](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CEsQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.heritage.org%2Findex%2Fpdf%2F2007%2Findex2007_chapter1.pdf&amp;ei=aKzwUMxc55aMAqfLgLgE&amp;usg=AFQjCNHgEf40UvhHBXGtLUBYAC9lOkXHWA&amp;sig2=B6mEN1YWmnsBFGn5lFZiUw&amp;bvm=bv.1357700187,d.cGE) and that inequality is exacerbated if not caused by what you might identify as \"right\" economic policies. Inequality only seems to be decreasing in [places that develop welfare states.](http://ciber.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Spur/Henisz_The_institutional_environment_EP.pdf)\n\nI would argue that much state-level welfare policy *is* a failure, however. The Housing and Urban Development department largely exists to transfer funds to the political allies of the party in charge, in my view. No one would argue that the \"War on Poverty\" has done much good for black Americans and people whose parents didn't go to college, for example - though that's tangled up with the rather illiberal \"War on Drugs.\"\n\nWas Jimmy Carter a progressive? Wasn't he the one who flip-flopped on defense dovish-ness and created America's carrier fleet? And was Clinton not a progressive? Wasn't he the one who [imposed the capital gains tax and the tax rates Bush campaigned against in the first place?](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CEQQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fscholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu%2Fcgi%2Fviewcontent.cgi%3Farticle%3D1750%26context%3Dwlulr&amp;ei=aarwUKnhM6iEjALF4YH4Cw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHRItaKjoMkl6d1c5lhpgiQ-f7-PQ&amp;sig2=AuL7lv-IpJnIdfNy-z-lyA&amp;bvm=bv.1357700187,d.cGE)\n\nBy and large, I would argue America's history vindicates progressive policies.", "id": "t1_c7vccag", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "casualfactors", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_16eihd", "selftext": "\"era of big government is over\"- yep yep progressive yep yep", "id": "t1_c7vchec", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Kaus3", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "It's probably better to refer to policies before campaign rhetoric.", "id": "t1_c7vckya", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "casualfactors", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c7vchec", "score": 9, "retrieved_on": 1430932197, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_16eihd", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7vckya", "author_flair_text": "[PhD, Former Campaign Tech][Independent]", "created_utc": "1357950375", "ups": 9, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c7vccag", "score": -10, "retrieved_on": 1430932142, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7vchec", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357950016", "ups": -10, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_16eihd", "id": "t1_c7vksds", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Lazyleader", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_16eihd", "selftext": "I would look around the marginal wealth distribution literature.

The 30s happened to coincide with widespread adoption of the tractor rather than the farmhand as the main unit of doing work in a country where over a third of the population was farmers, creating this thing you may be interested in called \"structural unemployment\" (see: an American economy after a big-computing revolution).\n\n[Explain why a study by the UCLA found that the New Deal extended the Great Depression by seven years.](http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/FDR-s-Policies-Prolonged-Depression-5409.aspx)\n\nIf your theory that the reason for the structural unemployment during the Great Depression was automation in agriculture were true, industrialization would've improved over time; however, [this is not the case as the Industrial production index fell by 21 from 1929 to 1935.](http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/parker.depression). The length of the depression was not merely centered in the agrarian center.\n\n&gt;I think there is general agreement, however, that tax cuts by and large have created more debt than they've solved (see the graph above, I suppose).\n\nNot true. If decreasing taxes leads to higher debt,then they would have to result in less revenue necessarily. However this is not the case. Consider the fact that despite more than fifty tax policy changes since World War II, revenue as a percentage of GDP has remained fairly constant at around 19%, as suggested by [Hauser's law.](http://books.google.com/books?id=X7zLmIK1HgEC&amp;num=13&amp;source=gbs_slider_user_shelves_7_homepage) Here is [a graph](http://i.imgur.com/uQrpM.jpg) of all exogenous tax changes with revenue changes over three years. As you can see, there is no direct relationship between tax cuts and lower revenue. (My sources for the tax changes are a [narrative analysis by Christina Romer](http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~cromer/nadraft1108.pdf) and the revenue data comes from the [Federal Reserve](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/).)\n\nThe reason for this is that revenue more closely follows economic growth than actual tax rates, as again suggested by Hauser's law. Thus the best pro-revenue tax policy is a pro-growth policy. As suggested by [Christina Romer's 2007 paper](http://www.nber.org/papers/w13264) which found that increasing taxes by 1% GDP rescinds GDP growth by 3%, the supply-side tax policies are more pro-growth.\n\n&gt;Deficits by themselves aren't \"bad,\" but it's hard to find inequality that is \"good.\"\n\nI refer you to the [Reinhardt-Rogoff paper](http://www.nber.org/papers/w18015) which found that 23 of 26 debt overhangs since World War II were coupled with GDP reduction and, internationally, countries with above 90% debt-to-GDP ratio experience 1.2% less GDP growth. Going by that paper; yes, deficit spending and debt itself, at least at levels seen in recent years, are \"bad.\"\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7w5r5l", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1358093691", "ups": 9, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t3_16eihd", "score": 20, "retrieved_on": 1430932075, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1357950293, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7vccag", "author_flair_text": "[PhD, Former Campaign Tech][Independent]", "created_utc": "1357949494", "ups": 20, "distinguished": null}

Political gerrymandering isn't illegal - in fact, in the legal case in which this was decided it was pointed out that creating partisan advantages is actually good for democracy when those advantages represent actual local political majorities. So in states where one party benefits greatly from redistricting, there's actually an argument that represents an acceptable equilibrium because that usually follows from an election in which that party won lots of seats.\n\nAdditionally most of the nation's weirdest-looking districts are in states covered by the Voting Rights Act, meaning they exist to help maximize the ability of \"communities of interest\" (poor minorities) to achieve effective representation in Congress. The benchmark for that is rather complicated to calculate but it is actually responsible for a fair number of minority representatives presently in Congress. It's not clear to me that's a problem.
