Usage of the militia in the early United States by the people who actually wrote the Constitution was used to put down insurrection (notably Washington leading state provided militias to put down the Whiskey Rebellion). \n\nWhile who is allowed to carry a gun, and what is considered to be a legitimate militia have expanded over time since than, voting and usage of the First Amendment and the court system have been the most effective ways to redress grievances with the government, not insurrection. \n\nAs a bit of a side note, I think a great way to encourage their cause would be for supporters of the Second Amendment to support private militias where the goal isn't a violent overthrow of the government if it doesn't do exactly what they want, but instead as community organizations that provide for the public interest in usually peaceful ways. Imagine if during a natural disaster the first responders was a local private militia saving lives and later working with the National Guard and other responders as they showed up. The good for their cause would be intense, and it would legitimize them far more than pretending that threatening to shoot up the government if they tighten regulations on their guns isn't terrorism.

The Constitution grants no true sovereignty to the states, but instead has a federal system that delegates powers. Furthermore nowhere in the Constitution are the states described as sovereign. \n\nStates also lack any measure of actual sovereignty that exists. They don't have domestic sovereignty, since federal agents supersede state agents, even in deciding where they can supersede them. The most certainly don't have interdependence sovereignty, because the Constitution expressly grants Congress power over interstate regulation. And they don't have international legal sovereignty, because nobody recognizes them as a sovereign body. \n\nYou might be thinking of the Articles of Confederation, a confederation rather then a federation like we have now, however the states didn't have any true soverignty in that either: \n\n&gt;And the Articles of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the Union shall be perpetual; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them; unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State. \n\nIf you can't unilaterally leave, and powers like being able to make treaties are forbidden from you without the consent of others, do you have sovereignty? \n\nThis is despite this text, which would make it less clear and maybe make it arguable, but note that this text only ever exists in the Articles of Confederation, no such text exists in the Constitution: \n\n&gt;Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by this Confederation expressly delegated to the United States, in Congress assembled. \n\n---\n\n&gt;Couldn't the States now take up the slack, decide on their priorities, and implement them at State level?\n\nSo long as Federal laws don't preempt them, they can do whatever they want. That's the whole point of a federal government. We don't need to lie about non-existent sovereignty in order to let the states do what is appropriate for them to do.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1nvwbe", "selftext": "&gt;but populations will be moving fast to find safety and security, requiring the establishment of martial law on a national level\n\nI'd imagine it may be imposed at the State level first, with states requesting Federal assistance in the form of the National Guard and even Federal troops to assist, and if this is some infectious issue, the CDC. This wouldn't be particularly unusual either, considering hurricanes have forced emergency action on a state level in the past. This isn't particularly hard in many places, as State Governors have a fair amount of power in times of emergency. \n\nIf it got real big, which doesn't seem terribly likely with the CDC on top of things (assuming they're not shut down because of say, a government shutdown), you'd then come up to the Federal level. \n\nFor martial law to be in the effect in the United States at a Federal level legally, you first have to have the court system not functioning, and since deployment of troops does not necessarily mean that the civil courts cannot function, and in combination with extended detention laws and state level martial law declarations, you'd likely have troops and CDC in force at the President's direction long before any Federal level martial law would even be considered seriously. \n\nThe Constitution has a relevant bit of text on this issue in Article 1, Section 9: \n\n&gt;The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\n\nBasically, you can't really have martial law legally without suspending Habeas Corpus, and this section authorizes the Congress to do just that. Legally this is backed by a bunch of laws Congress has written and Supreme Court cases. \n\nAfter the Congress suspends Habeas Corpus, then you have martial law. But, the Constitution also has something else relevant to this, Article 2, Section 2: \n\n&gt;The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States\n\nThe President controls the military, even in an emergency. So what happens to the President like in the title question? The military keeps him save! They'd also be protecting the Vice President, the Cabinet, the Congress, and probably some state lawmakers, and maybe some celebrities. \n\nLet's run down the rest of your questions: \n\n&gt;When martial law is established, what happens to the President and other big political players? Would they continue to be \"on duty?\"\n\nThey're on duty, and running things. The President is the guy giving orders. \n\n&gt;What would the President be responsible for if the military ran the entire state? Given that there isn't time for Senate and Congress type decision-making, how much would President [Obama] deal with directly and alone?\n\nYes, the President would still be responsible for the military. \n\nThe Senate and Congress would still make decisions, but in times of war, rebellion, or invasion, the President has a lot of power, and the Congress would be pretty fast to delegate it even if they have disagreements. They'd still be needed to vote for the treasury to release money to pay for everything for example, and they have to do it at least every two years in the case of the military because they can't do military spending on a time period longer than that due to the Constitution. \n\nWar also doesn't happen overnight, even a war on germs. So consider the drama that a battered Congress can bring to your story, they'd likely still be around, but maybe without any lobbyists, luxuries, or most of their staffers to help them run the show. \n\n&gt;What politicians would be considered crucial enough to be afforded security and protection by the military? Would they have to cover the costs of their own evacuations, security from rioting, etc, or is there some sort of provision for them within the law?\n\nI'm not 100% sure about who is provided what, but the military would have enough leeway to make tactical decisions on preserving the leadership. The limiting factors wouldn't be money, but instead things like gasoline (which, even with a good reserve, you'd need to ration if other things broke down) and manpower. \n\n&gt;Say the President dies. As I understand it the Vice President would assume his role, but in a scenario where the military controls the nation, would it matter? What if there was no one to assume the presidency?\n\nIt would be hard for the President to just be killed after he has gotten into emergency protections since we have plans to protect against nuclear war (sorry, I rate it higher than a plague in terms of shit has hit the fan). But anything goes to progress the plot right? \n\nThe President controls the military, and the Vice President can be temporarily made Acting President even if the President isn't dead yet, so there is no avoiding him short of killing him, especially since the sense of stability that the predetermined leadership provided by law might be a very important objective for the military to uphold, especially to retain legitimacy. \n\nAfter the President and the Vice President, you have a whole slew of bodies to pile up before you can write out the line of succession. \n\nAssuming none of these got refilled (the Congress would fight to refill the Speaker or the President pro tempore if those two died, so you'd probably have to have those eliminated entirely as well, as well as any state governors who could appoint a replacement for their Senator), you'd have to finish off the rest of the line of succession excepting anyone not qualified for the Presidency, nor acting (not confirmed by the Congress) Secretaries. You'd probably also want to get rid of the Supreme Court just to be safe if you're dead set on the military going it alone, but short of the Secretary of Defense being not qualified for the Presidency (being a former President who ran out his terms doesn't count enough to disqualify in such a situation), or just being an acting Secretary of Defense, they'd have no real head either. \n\nThe Presidential line of succession, after the President and Vice President would be the Speaker of the House, the President pro tempore of the Senate, Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Defense, Attorney General, Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, Secretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Secretary of Transportation, Secretary of Energy, Secretary of Education, Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Secretary of Homeland Security. \n\nThat's a lot of bodies and complication, especially for a nation that always has one of those names in a separate undisclosed location in case of attack. \n\n&gt;Are there any common misconceptions about martial law? Are portrayals of martial law in popular culture such as V for Vendetta or 28 Weeks Later more or less plausible?\n\nAll over your post, and remember that V for Vendetta and 28 Weeks Later both took place in Europe where the laws are very different. I'd suggest reading up on martial law in the United States and skimming martial law during the Civil War at the very least, even if your only source is Wikipedia.

However, the reason I mention it is because being in a bubble would be increasing our tax revenue, and our revenues in 2007 were particularly high.  \n\nSomething the Wikipedia article has that the data you linked does not have (or at least not easily read if it is there) is the mention that in 2007 we had an estimated [$345 billion in uncollected taxes](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15111003). Tallying this up with the receipts and stacking it against expenditures has us basically reaching the budget without a deficit when comparing it to data from the source you linked, in fact, I had originally assumed this would still have us borrowing from the Social Security Trust Fund, but this would eat all of the roughly $343 billion dollar deficit that stems from \"on budget\" spending that is outside the Trust Funds, before figuring the cost of collection. \n\nI suppose from here the question is, without the Bush tax cuts would we have at least made budget, even if we had to borrow from some of our Trust Funds? Finding this information wasn't as easy, [but the CBO had an article on this](http://www.cbo.gov/publication/41463), that links to a PDF with the data. The \"Bush tax cuts\" are EGTRRA and JGTRRA as listed if [Wikipedia is to be believed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_tax_cuts). Ignoring the minor outlay increases, the receipts changes of both of these together is roughly $156 billion, still short of making the total deficit for that year. \n\nSo while the Bush tax cuts would only put a dent in the deficit for the year 2007, uncollected taxes being collected would have just about eliminated them, and together we would have had a decent surplus. While this isn't to say there wasn't room for more efficiency in our spending at the time (2007 or earlier would have been the perfect time to make spending more efficient since it was during either economic growth or a bubble), it is really enlightening about what \"really happened\".

So what happened since then? \n\nWell, the House delegation for Arizona is now made up of five Democrats and four Republicans (and to add insult to injury, while they retained their majorities, both the State Senate and State House lost their super-majorities). \n\nSounds peachy right?

The Affordable Care Act was passed on March 23, 2010, just in time for the midterms to be impacted by the political ramifications of the law, and possibly, State level governments potentially in charge of redistricting. \n\n---\n\nFor example, [in Arizona](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party_strength_in_Arizona), the Governor was already shifted to a Republican due to Obama's election (because he appointed her to a Cabinet position, thanks Obama), however she faced and won her seat in the 2010 midterms. Also in the 2010 elections Republicans picked up three seats in the State Senate, and four in the State House, giving them 2/3 super-majorities in both. To add insult to injury, in 2010 the House went from five Democrats and three Republicans to three Democrats, five Republicans, and Ra\u00fal Grijalva, one of the more liberal Democrats had a very tough re-election, while Gabrielle Giffords had a close race against someone who wanted to [eliminate the Education Department](http://www.azcentral.com/news/election/azelections/articles/2010/11/05/20101105arizona-elections-gabrielle-giffords-elected.html?nclick_check=1), and was considered more conservative than Sarah Palin. \n\nArizona picked up a seat via redistricting for the 2012-2020 elections, and the Republicans were most completely in power after 2010, just in time for redistricting. So what happened since then? \n\nWell, the House delegation for Arizona is now made up of five Democrats and four Republicans (and to add insult to injury, while they retained their majorities, both the State Senate and State House lost their super-majorities). \n\nSounds peachy right? But consider that in 2000, Arizona enacted the \"Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission\" [consisting of two Democrats, two Republicans, and an Independent to draw district lines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redistricting_in_Arizona). Sounds a little more fair on its face ([although redistricting commissions aren't so peachy either, part of the reasons I favor STV over single member districts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mky11UJb9AY&amp;feature=share&amp;list=PLqs5ohhass_TF9mg-mqLie7Fqq1-FzOQc)), but [if you read about](http://azstarnet.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/gop-ousts-redistricting-chief/article_64206286-a5cc-5123-8705-cf379ca60836.html) [the fight that took place in 2010](http://azstarnet.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/brewer-cuts-legal-funds-for-mathis/article_30aed166-7536-5750-8c85-129d18a498c3.html) [over the redistricting plan](http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/opinions/articles/2011/11/02/20111102editorial1103-gop-tramples-redistricting.html), [it starts going back to showing why incumbents shouldn't be in control of redistricting](http://azstarnet.com/news/opinion/editorial/brewer-deals-out-injustice-to-redistrict-panel/article_d3e2b2f1-2057-5dfe-a4db-d3664121f2d1.html). \n\nBasically, the massively Republican dominated State government in Arizona tried its best to get a more Republican favoring redistricting plan going in Arizona, despite it being something supposedly delegated by law to an independent commission. \n\n---\n\nNote that I didn't answer why the Arizona State House and State Senate went more Republican though. That's the question we'd need to answer to verify your theory, but for all the other states that failed to protect their redistricting from the local government's influence. It is a tall order to determine if this is the case.

However, we can work with what we have now if need be. \n\nSo for smaller states, we'd probably end up with at-large superdistricts that fill the state, such as taking [Maine](http://www.fairvote.org/ME-Superdistrict#.Ug6RqW38kdU)'s two seats and putting them up to a single vote. \n\nFor larger states we can section it off into more geographic locations so that representatives are fairly local, while still having equal populations for each representative to represent (preserving one person one vote). However most of the examples I can provide are based on current districts, so they'll look a bit weirder then how superdistricts would naturally look.

The Constitution doesn't say anything about impeaching for something someone thinks is unconstitutional, but instead actually very specific crimes, in this case: \n\n&gt;treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\n\nNote that what the President did was essentially approved by the Congress. \n\nSo yeah, if you wanted the ability to hold the President accountable, than people should have been holding the House and Representatives more accountable. Many of them are essentially guilty of the same things the President is, and because of the extreme partisanship of the Republicans, history would only remember it as partisan bullshit. \n\n&gt;There needs to be a major reform in the way this government works. \n\nDo you have any suggestions? \n\nIt is incredibly easy to complain, but not as easy to have solutions.

Be a tiny bit realistic. \n\nLet's look at a hypothetical situation in which one major party says no instead though, since this is more realistic. I'm not saying this ever happened, because it would be beside the point in regards for your question. \n\nIn the supposed situation, the government goes to Google. They ask them to supply some form of data to them that Google doesn't want to supply without what they may feel is a proper warrant. Google says no, and refuses to submit to any gag orders on staying quiet, and come out very publicly about it, but perhaps not giving specific details. \n\nWhat can the government do? If Google already spoke out about it, if they arrest Google employees over it the public will be watching, especially if the higher ups go missing. If they do a seizure on Google servers, than Google will likely sue them. They could sue Google in court, with unknown consequences. Of course, things could also go nasty for Google, especially if shareholders don't like the risk to Google's bottom line. Whatever happens, there will be a chain of actions coming from this however, be it companies being more afraid to say no, or the public being more inclined to oppose current laws, or companies being more inclined to say no to requests. \n\nSo in this way more realistic scenario, where even one major party says no, you can have a big impact if you are a big enough public figure and you say no.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;A corollary to this question is: is it reasonable to set an upper limit on the amount of \"value\" one can accumulate? \n\nBetter question, is it even necessary? \n\nWith a progressive tax rate, you can increase the marginal tax rate more and more without ever having to hit 100% (a cap). \n\nWhat does this effectively do? Well, first, we have to understand marginal taxation. \n\nLet's say you had three tax brackets, 0% at $0, 10% at $100, and 90% at $1000, and you have someone making $1100. The first $100 isn't taxed, as this is at the 0% tax bracket, the next $900 is taxed at 10%, or $90 total, as this is at the 10% tax bracket, and the next $100 is taxed at 90%, or $90 total, as this is at the 90% tax bracket. The person would be paying $180 in taxes, or about 16% effective tax rate on all their money, but the tax bracket they're considered to be in is the 90% tax bracket. This should be pretty simple to understand, just add in more tax brackets, have a lower top tax bracket, and then complicate things with exceptions and you have the U.S. tax system. \n\nSo really, if you wanted, you could tax income above a certain amount at 100%, which would remove all incentive to make more money then that amount. This would probably be the method you'd choose if you were trying to set a cap on salary. \n\nBut consider the effective difference between 100% and 99%, at say, 1,000,000 and above (this is purely an example number, I am not advocating this). With 100%, there is no incentive to earn above this amount at all, and there will be no effort at all to earn more then that, and likely no tax revenue from it either. But at 99%, you'd be taxed at 990,000 for every 1,000,000 you make at this tax rate, and you'd still get $10,000 for your efforts. You still have the power to decide the trade offs of earning more if you really, really want the money, but you would be incentivized to do something else with your money, such as invest it before it is considered income. As an added bonus the government would be able to collect the taxed amount and use it to pay for any damages that you having an extreme amount of wealth might be doing to the economy. \n\nIdeally, you'd want to balance the amount somewhere where people are encouraged to earn as much as they'd like, but you can collect enough money to counter the negative effects of massive wealth concentration on others, as well as government services used.

For me to support a 99% top marginal tax rate, it would have to have very good reasoning behind it. \n\n&gt;first need to make capital gains be legally considered to be income\n\nCapital gains are a touchy subject between people. We have three or four separate views (ignoring views that don't actually help any political discussion such as \"taxes are theft\"), that go like this: \n\n1. 0% capital gains tax. \n2. Lower tax on capital gains over income tax. \n3. Higher tax on capital gains over income tax. \n4. Tax capital gains as income. \n\nNote that even in these four listed examples, you don't get more complex bits of different law suggestions, such as not claiming gains until you sell the particular capital, if it is treated as income or capital gains if you've held onto the asset for a certain amount of time, whether or not to treat dividends as capital, and how to treat capital gains when inheriting capital, among other things. \n\nCapital gains taxes are pretty complicated, and don't always follow simple rules. I can't pretend to have a perfect understanding of the tax system either, so I'm not completely sure what is the case now. \n\nPersonally I would like capital gains to just be taxed as normal income (thus at the same rate as the rest of someone's income) when it is actualized, like dividends are currently taxed, with the idea that you can defer this if you reinvest rather then actualizing the profits from the capital. \n\nI suppose the real idea would be a tax code simple enough that you can write an explanation of the tax code for individuals on a single page, and anyone with a basic understanding of math could file and act in a way that maximizes their personal gain without having to ask a team of accountants for advice.

Beyond that you might have additional requirements to be listed on the ballot, but that's not strictly necessary in all areas considering write-ins. \n\nIf we required representatives to do this or that to even run for office whenever someone had a plan that sounded good at the time we'd be pressuring every candidate to have a birth certificate, tax records for the last five years, business plan, budget, high school transcripts, college transcripts, high school diploma, college degree, credit score, and whatever else, and it would be so rigid that someone without one of those things EXACTLY would be disqualified from even running even if they fit the normal criteria (fit residency/citizenship/age requirements and get enough votes to win). \n\n&gt;Essentially asking, why is the government not run like a business?\n\nThe government is not a business. If you try to treat it as one (especially when it comes to a budget), you're going to have a bad time.

Representatives can tell you what you want to hear rather then what they'll be capable of and many usually do by proposing outrageous budgets that will never, ever get passed, or other plans that aren't politically feasible. \n\nSo while it is nice to demand a simple and easy to understand plan from our representatives, we should also acknowledge that anyone we elect can't be a dictator and do whatever they want, especially if they make a promise that isn't popular with the other representatives. \n\n---\n\nBy the way, while not strictly the \"business plan\" you might want, budgets are interesting things to look over.

Wouldn't it be wiser to tackle the problem of political parties first? Why not tackle primaries? \n\nLet's leave the term limit debate out of this for now, and not fundamentally change what House Representatives are. \n\nEliminate primaries and party affiliations for Federal elections. Have Senators elected with an instant-runoff voting so that a true majority can compromise on who they want to win, and then have Representatives elected in superdistricts in states with more then one Representative, and have Representatives elected with instant-runoff voting mixed with superdistricts as well. For the final nail in the coffin, have the President elected by popular vote by IRV method as well. \n\nYou've just killed parties being able to primary anyone, and they're no better off then any other political organization in the United States.

A 30-40 percent difference is rather statistically insignificant when it means a difference of just a couple percentage points. The dataset also ignores the fact that murder rates tend to be higher in poorer, urban areas. The simple fact is there are far more major population centers in the states that have the death penalty. Think of the major cities in the states with the highest homicide rates: Louisiana - New Orleans. Maryland - Baltimore. Tennessee - Memphis, Nashville. Oklahoma - OKC. Georgia - Atlanta. Florida - Miami, Orlando, Tallahassee, Jacksonville. Texas - El Paso, San Antonio, Houston, Austin, DFW.
