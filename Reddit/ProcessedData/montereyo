Being that I can't even afford insurance I can't pay these bills and I go bankrupt trying to pay them off as my bills reach the 10s of thousands.\n\nUnder the ACA if I can't afford insurance I can get medicaid. If I am in one of the red states that didn't expand medicaid then I can't afford insurance so i have to pay mandate.  Currently that mandate is only $95 bucks for an adult but lets say its 2016 and I owe the $695 dollars. \n\nIf I don't get sick that means I paid $695 dollars for nothing.\n\nIf I do get sick though instead of having to go to the Emergency room I can sign up for insurance and they can't refuse me for pre-existing condition. Now I can go to the doctor and the insurance pays for the visit and for my medication and treatments.\n\nTo sum up I can either pay nothing and hope not to get sick but if I do end up owing 10,000 of dollars that  I can't afford or with the ACA I can not get sick and pay 58 bucks a month but if I do get sick I can still get insurance which will cover all my medical expenses.\n\n\n&gt;So instead they send you a bill that somewhat resembles what people with insurance pay and charge the government for the rest. \n\nSo you think it is better for everyone else to pay taxes because this person doesn't have insurance then for this person to pay an individual tax for not having insurance.", "id": "t1_ccs6acb", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Filbert_Turtle", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ohmii", "id": "t1_ccs73nt", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "faceless_masses", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;For some reason I doubt you are actually talking about you.\n\nYour right it is not, it is an example.\n\n&gt;his supposed person you reference who can't afford insurance will be just fine.

If I am in one of the red states that didn't expand medicaid then I can't afford insurance so i have to pay mandate.  Currently that mandate is only $95 bucks for an adult but lets say its 2016 and I owe the $695 dollars. \n\nIf I don't get sick that means I paid $695 dollars for nothing.\n\nIf I do get sick though instead of having to go to the Emergency room I can sign up for insurance and they can't refuse me for pre-existing condition. Now I can go to the doctor and the insurance pays for the visit and for my medication and treatments.\n\nTo sum up I can either pay nothing and hope not to get sick but if I do end up owing 10,000 of dollars that  I can't afford or with the ACA I can not get sick and pay 58 bucks a month but if I do get sick I can still get insurance which will cover all my medical expenses.\n\n\n&gt;So instead they send you a bill that somewhat resembles what people with insurance pay and charge the government for the rest. \n\nSo you think it is better for everyone else to pay taxes because this person doesn't have insurance then for this person to pay an individual tax for not having insurance.", "id": "t1_ccs6acb", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Filbert_Turtle", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ohmii", "id": "t1_ccs73nt", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "faceless_masses", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;For some reason I doubt you are actually talking about you.\n\nYour right it is not, it is an example.\n\n&gt;his supposed person you reference who can't afford insurance will be just fine.

Maybe they decide not to pay for preventative check ups so they can make bank when an otherwise preventable issue lands you in a hospital bed.

I did some examples using [the Kaiser Foundation's calculator](http://kff.org/interactive/subsidy-calculator/). I used Jackson, MS as my example, just because it was the first place in a non-subsidy state I could think of. One 21 year old making $12000 a year  should only be paying $240 a year out of pocket. Two 25 year olds with no kids or a single parent with one kid making $16000 would pay $320. Two 30 year old adults with two kids making $24000 would pay about $480. These incomes are each just over the Federal poverty line for a family of that size, and each one is getting 98% of their premium subsidized.\n\nThe reason I say 'in principle' is that the subsidy comes in the form of a tax credit.

The Democrats were negotiating within their own party to get it passed through the Senate. There were people like Evan Bayh (R-IN) who would have never even considered supporting a healthcare plan that included single payer. The Democrats needed to get to a Supermajority in Congress and that required getting all Democrats on board. \n\nDo you honestly think that the Democratic Party could have even got 40 votes in the Senate for a single payer bill? Look at the 2010 election. The Democrats who were hesitant to support the bill were proven right. More than 60 Democrats lost their seats in Congress in one of the biggest swings in Congressional history due to the healthcare vote. \n\nYou are 100% correct that much of the bill was supported by the Heritage Foundation in the 90s. There is no way anyone can deny that. However, that idea has not been supported by Republicans for over a decade. The GOP has moved to the right and what they liked in the 90s is unacceptable today. \n\nThe PPACA was written based on the current state of the Democratic Party, which has also moved a bit to the right (as a whole, there are some within that have moved significantly left, but the Party is more conservative in general than in the 70s, 80s or 90s). \n\nThe Democrats made a compromise to the 1990s Republicans and to 2009 Democrats, but the problem was that there weren't many 1990s Republicans in Congress in 2009. \n\nNot a single Republican supported the law. So, then, why would they even compromise with the GOP? That would be absolutely terrible leadership and would be reason to completely get rid of the Democratic Congressional leadership. \n\nLets illustrate this. For this conversation, lets say that the ideal Democratic, bill that apparently the Democrats wanted is 100 points. The ideal GOP position would be 0 points. The Democrats didn't need a single Republican to support their bill. Were they just saying, \"Hey, we are nice guys, so even though we don't need you, we are going to throw out what we want and give you a 75 point bill\"? The Republicans were always saying \"Nope, give us a 0 point bill. We want compromise, so let's settle on a 5 point bill. Deal?\" Of course, the Democrats didn't need the GOP, so they didn't have to make compromises. They could have gotten their ideal bill, all 100 points, right? Except people like Joe Lieberman and Ben Nelson weren't on board with 100 points. And unless they got both of those guys, the Democrats would get nothing because of the filibuster threat.\n\n[Following the Finance Committee vote, negotiations turned to the demands of moderate Democrats to finalize their support, whose votes would be necessary to break the Republican filibuster. Majority leader Harry Reid focused on satisfying the centrist members of the Democratic caucus until the holdouts narrowed down to Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, an independent who caucused with Democrats, and Ben Nelson of Nebraska. Lieberman, despite intense negotiations in search of a compromise by Reid, refused to support a public option; a concession granted only after Lieberman agreed to commit to voting for the bill if the provision was not included,[75][92] even though it had majority support in Congress.[93] There was debate among supporters of the bill about the importance of the public option,[94] although the vast majority of supporters concluded that it was a minor part of the reform overall,[92] and that congressional Democrats' fight for it won various concessions, including conditional waivers allowing states to set up state-based public options such as Vermont's Green Mountain Care.[93][95]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act#Senate)", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1noe0o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cckyc3a", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1380900199", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t3_1noe0o", "score": 15, "retrieved_on": 1429255708, "controversiality": 0, "body": "The Heritage Foundation (a conservative think tank) proposed it in 1989, and Republicans put forward two bills during the Clinton Administration that would have made an individual mandate as the \"conservative\" health care alternative. \n\nObama himself opposed it in an interview in 2008:\n\n&gt; \"Both of us want to provide health care to all Americans.
