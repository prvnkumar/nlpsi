This scandal is going to give Christie trouble in his next race regardless of the coverage or the polls (but together they paint a dark picture for him.) By contrast, Sandford easily moved past his infidelity scandal in his next race, and his next race itself was less salient (than a Presidential bid, obviously.)

This scandal is going to give Christie trouble in his next race regardless of the coverage or the polls (but together they paint a dark picture for him.) By contrast, Sandford easily moved past his infidelity scandal in his next race, and his next race itself was less salient (than a Presidential bid, obviously.)

There are two parties that want significant changes and neither has quite enough support to push their agendas.  As support I'll note the period of 2000-2006 when we had a 100% GOP controlled government.  Two wars, tax cuts, DHS creating a second big government within an already big government, a huge, unpaid for expansion of Medicare, and deregulation mixed with defunding of institutions and regulations that protected the America economy for 60 years.  Fast forward to 2008-2010 and you have the democrats with the same scenario of holding all three branches.  The democrats got the ACA.  Folks can go on about what a watered down POS it was thanks to lobbying and giveaways to major players in Big Med, but it is a significant change.  Thanks to the Franken delay they did not get much time to implement other ideas, but they were certainly trying to swing back on many of the changes from the previous GOP run.\n\nWhat I see is a government mired by special interests all trying to increase their piece of American Pie.  The big players seem to want to make their special status protected and are all trying to generate big profits via legislation.  Be it Military Contractors, Insurance companies, Big Banks, etc; it does not matter.  They all want a guaranteed income without taking risks.  This is the radical change in the good old USA that the two parties are both accomplices in.  Where once stood the American dream and meritocracy, now stands a .01% that wants to turn America into a hereditary oligarchy with a political system that coddles them for a few crumbs of the wealth they are hoarding.\n\nIs the entire government bad?  No, there are plenty of folks that detest what is happening in our political parties.  Sadly they are drowned out by the voices parroting the desires of the .01%.  In my opinion, the GOP is far more sold out to these interests based upon how pig headed they are acting.  I would say they are reactionary, but I don't think they would give up Big Military while they are trying to force the economy back to Guilded Age policies.  I believe most of the American people are in the Centrist camp.  Sadly, the people willing to get out on election day typically are not.  And this is the truly sad part as globalization is not going away and we need a government willing to adjust policies to adapt to the new global economy.

Those fears were responded to by many Republicans as things that needed to be silenced increasingly forcefully, as victory against the Communist enemy would only be guaranteed if the US would not lose its will to fight for what Republicans considered \"American values,\" like the nuclear family, localism, individualism, and pride in the community, now things long gone in the GOP.\n\n* Establishment Republicans (Romney): conservative liberals (laissez faire with firm belief in social order and authority).

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1iwt1z", "selftext": "It seems I also need the space of two comments. Part one of two:\n\n&gt;Reddit isn't a great place to find credible opinions on election reform\n\nWhere on reddit? This subreddit is moderated by professional persons who work in politics. In this series of threads I've certainly interacted with a number of what you call 'typical people'  (I am myself a typical person in many ways) but I've also had the opportunity to debate with studious persons who call things by their right names. Not every community on reddit is the same.\n\n&gt;1) it's pretty easy to tell who's seen the inside of a relevant political science classroom and 2) everybody's grand idea is mostly a front to earn legislative seats for their pet ideology, i.e. not actually to make democracy work better for everybody considering our already existing confines.\n\nI have exclusively argued that any election reform ought to produce a more representative and legitimate government *for all.* I certainly wouldn't want to impose my singular will on the USA as an authoritarian. I can't speak for anybody else and I do not understand why you saw fit to leave some of these generalizations unqualified.\n\n&gt;You can tell this because none of the most popular ideas take into account the fact that electoral systems, party systems, and legislative institutions are all influences on each other, and none should be reformed without considering the effects on the others. \n\nI would agree that the most popular ideas (proportional representation, campaign finance, voter ID) are also ideological and are not sufficiently holistic. On the other hand, I don't consider that a reason to consider election reform to be without merit whatsoever.\n\n&gt;I'm sorry in advance that this is going to be kind of a long demonstration of the point\n\nNot at all. These threads can get very long: [check this one out](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1ij0ht/is_the_federal_electoral_system_in_the_united/cb5fega)\n\n&gt;I expect people to ignore the argument or misunderstand it anyway.\n\nWell that would be for lack of trying then wouldn't it? I've already committed numerous times in this series that I will argue in good faith so I don't see where you got that idea.\n\n&gt;But the point, just to get it out there, is that we should be seriously asking ourselves whether the reforms we're so willing to advance are actually going to be sensible considering the institutions we have and what we want to get out of them. \n\nAbsolutely, the mark of a critical thinker is the willingness to re-examine previously held assertions. Having said that, you spend most of your lengthy post explaining how you think election reform ought to *not* go forward rather than how it should if it does (which is what this thread is for: recall that the question was 'what is the most viable path to election reform and should it be prioritized?')\n\n&gt;More on what I mean: from the standpoint of voting and elections, an American political party has three primary purposes: serving as an ideological guide post to connect voters with coalitions within government institutions, nominating candidates for office, and funding campaigns.\n\nI would say that there is another way of looking at it: that parties are purely purposed with organizing and consolidating political power and the listed functions are just methods of doing so. Anyway I accept your premise for the sake of argument.\n\n&gt;But throughout the 20th century, \"progressive\" reforms chipped away at the latter two functions, what with the binding primary system, which severely limits parties' ability to advance the candidates they want, creating inefficient and unnecessary shit-shows like the 2012 GOP primary, and caps on monetary donations to parties, which don't actually LIMIT the amount of money in politics so much as spread it around to other committees and interest groups. \n\nSounds like you're pretty dissatisfied with that setup, don't you think it could be reformed for the benefit of all?\n\n&gt;One thing you have to realize is that the presidential candidates' campaigns, the parties' presidential campaign committees, senatorial candidates' campaigns, parties' senatorial campaign committees, house candidates, the parties' house campaign committees, and all of the numerous interest groups, are all trying to get donations from the same pool of donors with money to spend. \n\nAnd? The doctrine of freedom of speech+ under the first amendment entitles persons to spend their money 'as speech.' I agree that capping campaign contributions in the context of our electoral framework is presently pushing contributions toward special interests, but I don't necessarily think that any or all caps on campaign contributions have to have that effect.\n\n&gt;So why would people want to make all elections publicly funded? This completely ruins parties' ability to prioritize the candidacies of certain politicians that the party values in advancing the policies that the MAJORITY of people want their preferred parties to be pushing.\n\nI think when people espouse the view that elections should be publicly funded they envision that policy as a silver bullet to create a level monetary playing feild for all candidates (obviously it isn't that simple, but a level playing feild isn't an awful goal to set wouldn't you say? After all 'we're a capitalist country herp derp'.)\n\n&gt;And it doesn't prevent money from going to interest groups either.\n\nAnd it shouldn't because public finance has nothing to do with PAC reform et al. If you want to reform 501c and the like then that's a policy option that isn't directly related to public finance. I think quite a few redditors that you've come across probably want to clamp down on private money in politics and phase in public finance but I'm not convinced that that would be constructive.\n\n&gt;Which brings us to a second discussion about parties that people (wrongly, if you ask me) use as inspiration for their proposed electoral reforms: they don't like that there are only two parties.\n\nSo link them to an article on Duverger's law and move on (I see that happen all the time on reddit, there's a youtube video that's often used for that purpose because it has cuddly animals.)\n\n&gt;so they brainstorm ways to give their ideas undeserved influence in government. \n\nI don't think *any* lessening of the barriers to entry amounts to giving third parties undue influence, it's much more nuanced than that. For example, why can't the Comt. On Presidential Debates go to a more proportional representation [(or just stop playing keep-away with the mic.)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_on_Presidential_Debates#Lawsuits)\n\n&gt;But is having only two parties as bad as everyone says it is?\n\nIt doesn't really matter, recall the Duverger's is a *law.* The real question is how much power should the major parties have to create barriers to entry for third party candidates?\n\n&gt;politically educated people who know enough about electoral reform to discuss it openly on a forum like this.\n\nThat's never stopped anybody before. Besides, the founders intended for the USA system to be representative even for persons who aren't fully congnizent of the nuance involved in the political process or governance (this is because *anybody can be mobilized by leaders, no matter their level of education.*) If low information voters are coming over to the side of given issue that's not much more than a minor indicator of how viable the position is.\n\n&gt;Those typical people instead largely rely on party, retrospective evaluations of parties' and politicians' performance in office, and \"who\" parties stand for (not so much \"what\" they stand for specifically) as guides for their voting decisions.\n\n[Coincidentally this topic already came up on this thread!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1iwt1z/what_is_the_most_viable_path_to_election_reform/cb8zpb7) You're talking about the purposive motivation for voting. I agree, a functionally representative government must, at least in part, make use of this mechanic.\n\n&gt;Not to mention, the \"big\" ideas that people look to third parties for are not the issues on which a major party would readily compromise anyway, so it's not like forcing minority parties to make majority coalitions is going to magically bring about the changes that the third-wayists on reddit want anyway.\n\n'Third-way' refers to a centrist position rather than a position in favor of third parties. Having said that, third parties aren't intended to govern in conjunction with major parties (in the USA,) they are intended to replace one of the major parties when they collapse (which has happened periodically throughout our history.) At this time it is my assesment that third parties aren't viable federally so I don't offer them much support, but they are legitimate on the basis of the aforementioned.", "id": "t1_cb95w15", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cb93g39", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430355481, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1374657891, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cb95w15", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1374657697", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}
{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Part two:\n\n\n&gt;All of this is true, while the criticism that two parties are ideologically restrictive (at least in some \"unjust\" way) is probably not even terrible accurate -- or at least, it's not a bad thing in the grand scheme of things; the two party system probably, theoretically, works just fine, and here's why. A lot of partisan politics happens at the state level (not in state government necessarily, but with the state as the level of analysis) because politicians must respond to varying constituencies to win their elections. A Mississippi Republican does not look the same as a Massachusetts Republican.\n\nDamn right they look different! I agree that saying one or another party is 'ideologically restrictive' doesn't pass the smell test, the real question is whether they are responsive and representative.\n\n&gt;As a result, even though the aggregate title of \"Republican\" and \"Democrat\" represent behemoth, relatively centrist catch-all constituencies, there is still some nontrivial variation in the values that different politicians have as a function of where they come from.\n\nOf course there is, the problem arises when they all tie themselves together with money. For example, after the Sandy Hook disaster (and the apertaining legislative trainwreck) there was a whisper campaign to cut bluedogs off from D triple C funds. Didn't happen. There is as much of a nontrival association among Ds and Rs as there are differences.\n\n&gt;It's not necessarily true that the politicians third-party-advocates want aren't out there. They're just running as Rs or Ds.\n\nThe candidates third-party-advocates *really* want (or should) are candidates who will help to break up one of the major parties (the one that is closest to their own ideology of course) by running against them from the 'fringe'. So your point here is either lost on me or it doesn't ring true for that reason.\n\n&gt;If a constituency has the potential to elect these people under a third party, then they should certainly have greater potential to elect them under a major party.\n\nAgain, how are you reaching that conclusion? If there is a level of support for a third party that constitutes a majority (in some district X) then that logically entails that there is *not* a majority constituency for a major party. 'There can be only one' (majority per constituency,) this much is mathematically certain.\n\n&gt;But belonging to a major party is actually better, because now the desired candidate gets to caucus with a legitimate party (i.e. he has the ears of people who matter more than a lone-body) and also gets a piece of the party's fundraising pie.\n\nYou must never have heard of Senator Bernie Sanders (who caucuses with the Ds but is a Socialist.) Or the Tea Party.\n\n&gt;Third parties cannot boast that.\n\nThe Tea Party can. So can the above mentioned Sen. Sanders.\n\n&gt;So in short, if you think the electorate can stomach the candidates that these reformists want, then they probably already are stomaching those candidates...They have unpopular ideas, and are thus failing because they aren't being endorsed by the public.\n\nThis ignores so much nuance: are there no barriers to entry besides public support? Does it not cost a significant amount of money to run a race in any media market of significant size? Are there no administrative barriers that would be more difficult for an L than a D or an R? Are ALL of these barriers to entry legitimate and just? (Shouldn't we consider reducing them as part of election reform *if* it goes forward?)\n\n&gt;That's how democracy works, and it's not necessarily a fault in the system that some ideas are unelectable at this point in time.\nWhat ideas do you say are unelectable at this time? I'm not clear on what you're talking about specifically.\n\n&gt;The fact remains that the major parties by and large reflect the majority of the population's political opinions and values, and rigging the system to give a fringe ideology more influence either (a) is redundant and counter-productive because those politicians already exist within the parties that are being railed against, or (b) is in direct defiance of the country's general majoritarianism.\n\nThat's the question:  do the major parties remain representative? In congress they certainly aren't: [they can't even pass a fucking farm bill.](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/306981-farm-bill-setback-opens-gop-to-attacks-about-ability-to-lead) Ornstien and Mann published some good analysis in 2012 about how successive anti-incumbency waves strongly indicate that voters are frustrated with their level of representation and, for lack of a better option, are 'throwing out the bums' with increasing frequency. I would certainly agree that we shouldn't be rigging the the system but third party advocates aren't calling for a re-rigging, they're calling for an un-rigging (as far as I can tell.) Have a look at what I mean: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_on_Presidential_Debates#Lawsuits\n\nNow, just because they espouse those positions doesn't mean they don't have ulterior motives, but I think it's clear that you're mischaracterizing their proposals (if not their intention.)\n\n&gt;Good ideas don't deserve to be policy without popular endorsement just because [some small internet community that thinks' it has all the answers] thinks they're good ideas. That's just authoritarian.\n\nWho are the obnoxious people you've been speaking to, that you think this conversation is remotely about making internet collectives like reddit the arbiters of USA politics? No serious person could hope to defend that view as an intellectual proposition IMHO. If you're serious about this part then you've been wildly misled or perhaps trolled.\n\n&gt;Sorry for the essay, and sorry to anybody reading it if it was hard to follow. I just find it off-putting that there are so many people who roguishly push for electoral reforms without taking a step back and realizing that these institutions are working together in a way that is practical and (mostly) internally coherent.\n\nNo need to be sorry. Practicality and coherence are good things, but without a quality of responsiveness and representation we're right back where we started: shouting \"NO [fill in the blank] WITHOUT REPRESENTATION.\"\n\n&gt;A small segment of people want to reform the electoral system because they want to legitimize their generally unpopular or unfeasible ideas. \n\nhttp://www.gallup.com/poll/159881/americans-call-term-limits-end-electoral-college.aspx\n\nRather than getting my information about public sentiment from 'some small internet communty' I prefer to get it from major polling firms like Gallup. The headline of this article is: \"Americans Call for Term Limits, End to Electoral College, Virtually no partisan disagreement on these long-discussed constitutional reforms.\" Bullet point one rest on air.\n\n&gt;The two-party system probably works not-too-badly in fielding these ideas in the first place. If these ideas can survive in democracy, then these ideas are probably already being represented by the fringe ideologues within the parties, since partisan politics as it stands permits some ideological variation within the parties on account of parties haven't been allowed pick their candidates for themselves since like, the 70s.\n\nI can sympathize with your criticism of 70s electoral regulations and reforms but that's an arguement *for* election reform (in this case to address flaws in those policies,) not against it. The two party system is engrained, there's no need to argue in favor of it because Duverger's law is a *law.* Point 2 runs contrary to your thesis.\n\n&gt;The majority of people happily endorse their preferred party.\nPoint three is a tautology. As a standalone it is as pertinent as the statement \"Democrats like democrat stuff.\"\n\n&gt;Weakening parties just to weaken them is counterproductive to the parties' existential effort to enact the political visions of their constituents, which, pursuant to point 3, encapsulates the majority of the polity.\n\nPoint four takes for a premise the false assumption that politics is a zero-sum game. By strengthening competition and reducing barriers to entry all parties stand to increase their efficacy and influence.\n\n&gt;Our legislative institutions are not designed to handle multiple parties, and multiple parties don't function as well within our legislative institutions. And changing the institutions doesn't seem like the best idea either, since we don't see the majority of the population wanting a parliamentary system (or multiple parties for that matter) any time soon.\n\nPoint five isn't particularly objectionable in any way IMO, but it hardly substantiates the notion that we should, for some reason, avoid making adjustments to our electoral system.\n\n&gt;So why be hasty to reform electoral institutions if the people (on reddit at least ~~LOL~~) who are trying to hard to make it happen don't even really acknowledge how electoral systems fit into the broader philosophy of our governmental institutions or party systems?\n\nThere are low information voters among the ranks of every faction on every issue and you know that, so this point doesn't really ring true. Argue in good faith, if you please. I certainly have taken a good deal of time to study my civic environment before coming here, so I would appreciate it if you would paint with a finer brushstroke.\n\n&gt; We need to pass muster on this AT MINIMUM if we're going to take sweeping electoral reforms seriously. We should be willing to listen to ideas that people think will legitimately make democracy better for the country, but for real, we need to be able to distinguish \"make democracy better for the country\" from \"make democracy better for MYSELF\" if we want to take these ideas seriously.\n\nIf 'we' means the intellectual leadership of a given activity on a given issue then I would always agree with the above, but all viable political movments in the US become and stay viable by appealing to low information voters.\n\n", "id": "t1_cb95ylw", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cb93g39", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430355448, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1iwt1z", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cb95ylw", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1374658204", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

What exactly is the scenario that you're envisioning (I think I am missing your specific point.)\n\n&gt;Your asking career politicians at the state level to spearhead an effort to eliminate career politicians at the federal level. Many state legislators owe their position in elected office to the efforts to their party's federal legislators.\n\n&gt;For example, there isn't a single Republican legislator in Kentucky that would vote to term-limit Mitch McConnell's career in the US Senate, given that McConnell is by-far the most powerful Republican in KY and the KY GOP owes nearly every dollar they have to McConnell.\n\n&gt;Likewise, you aren't going to find many Democratic legislators in California that would vote to term limit Nancy Pelosi or Barbara Boxer - because they too enjoy the benefits of their federal counterparts' seniority. \n\nSo, because of the problems that election reform is intended to address, election reform isn't possible? Again, this thread is for persons interested in discussing what the maximally viable proposal for election reform might look like. Nay-saying is a legitimate point of view but if you have nothing to contribute then I have nothing to say to you.\n\n&gt;Are there a few reform-minded/progressive state legislators that would vote for an Amendment establishing federal term limits - yes of course. But you need a super majority, and you need it in at least 38 states. \n\nThat's only one way forward, another way is to continue growing the 'problem solvers caucus' which didn't exist only a few years ago.\n\n&gt;It's not my standard we are discussing - It's Article V of the U.S. Constitution. That is the standard. I'm simply placing the standard of Article V into political context for the purposes of accessing viability. It is in my professional opinion that at this time, a U.S. Constitutional Amendment establishing term limits for federal office is simply not viable. \n\nAnd that is certainly a legitimate point of view. My point is that if you're only talking about what ISN'T viable (from your POV) and not what is comparatively MORE viable than the other options then you're just trolling the thread because you have nothing pertinent to say.

Many state legislators owe their position in elected office to the efforts to their party's federal legislators.\n\n&gt;For example, there isn't a single Republican legislator in Kentucky that would vote to term-limit Mitch McConnell's career in the US Senate, given that McConnell is by-far the most powerful Republican in KY and the KY GOP owes nearly every dollar they have to McConnell.\n\n&gt;Likewise, you aren't going to find many Democratic legislators in California that would vote to term limit Nancy Pelosi or Barbara Boxer - because they too enjoy the benefits of their federal counterparts' seniority. \n\nSo, because of the problems that election reform is intended to address, election reform isn't possible? Again, this thread is for persons interested in discussing what the maximally viable proposal for election reform might look like. Nay-saying is a legitimate point of view but if you have nothing to contribute then I have nothing to say to you.\n\n&gt;Are there a few reform-minded/progressive state legislators that would vote for an Amendment establishing federal term limits - yes of course. But you need a super majority, and you need it in at least 38 states. \n\nThat's only one way forward, another way is to continue growing the 'problem solvers caucus' which didn't exist only a few years ago.\n\n&gt;It's not my standard we are discussing - It's Article V of the U.S. Constitution. That is the standard. I'm simply placing the standard of Article V into political context for the purposes of accessing viability.

My point is that if you're only talking about what ISN'T viable (from your POV) and not what is comparatively MORE viable than the other options then you're just trolling the thread because you have nothing pertinent to say.

A union has every right to desire a better life for the people they represent but a congressman or senator doesn't just represent the union workers. They represents the entire state or their district. If the union is asking them to do something that will hurt the rest of the country or the rest of their members they should say no. You are also assuming that a union is always representing the worker's best interests in both the short term and long term.

The minute we start picking and choosing which special interests are good for the country instead of which specific ideas are good for the country we the people have lost and a very small group of the population has all the power. Which subsection of that small group of people has the power is up in the air and they may be fighting back in forth with each other but it is no longer the american people that are in control. \n\nI see no difference between a default support of special interests when it comes to corporations and special interests like unions.

Part one of two:\n\n&gt;Reddit isn't a great place to find credible opinions on election reform\n\nWhere on reddit? This subreddit is moderated by professional persons who work in politics. In this series of threads I've certainly interacted with a number of what you call 'typical people'  (I am myself a typical person in many ways) but I've also had the opportunity to debate with studious persons who call things by their right names. Not every community on reddit is the same.\n\n&gt;1) it's pretty easy to tell who's seen the inside of a relevant political science classroom and 2) everybody's grand idea is mostly a front to earn legislative seats for their pet ideology, i.e. not actually to make democracy work better for everybody considering our already existing confines.\n\nI have exclusively argued that any election reform ought to produce a more representative and legitimate government *for all.* I certainly wouldn't want to impose my singular will on the USA as an authoritarian. I can't speak for anybody else and I do not understand why you saw fit to leave some of these generalizations unqualified.\n\n&gt;You can tell this because none of the most popular ideas take into account the fact that electoral systems, party systems, and legislative institutions are all influences on each other, and none should be reformed without considering the effects on the others. \n\nI would agree that the most popular ideas (proportional representation, campaign finance, voter ID) are also ideological and are not sufficiently holistic. On the other hand, I don't consider that a reason to consider election reform to be without merit whatsoever.\n\n&gt;I'm sorry in advance that this is going to be kind of a long demonstration of the point\n\nNot at all. These threads can get very long: [check this one out](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1ij0ht/is_the_federal_electoral_system_in_the_united/cb5fega)\n\n&gt;I expect people to ignore the argument or misunderstand it anyway.\n\nWell that would be for lack of trying then wouldn't it? I've already committed numerous times in this series that I will argue in good faith so I don't see where you got that idea.\n\n&gt;But the point, just to get it out there, is that we should be seriously asking ourselves whether the reforms we're so willing to advance are actually going to be sensible considering the institutions we have and what we want to get out of them. \n\nAbsolutely, the mark of a critical thinker is the willingness to re-examine previously held assertions. Having said that, you spend most of your lengthy post explaining how you think election reform ought to *not* go forward rather than how it should if it does (which is what this thread is for: recall that the question was 'what is the most viable path to election reform and should it be prioritized?')\n\n&gt;More on what I mean: from the standpoint of voting and elections, an American political party has three primary purposes: serving as an ideological guide post to connect voters with coalitions within government institutions, nominating candidates for office, and funding campaigns.\n\nI would say that there is another way of looking at it: that parties are purely purposed with organizing and consolidating political power and the listed functions are just methods of doing so. Anyway I accept your premise for the sake of argument.\n\n&gt;But throughout the 20th century, \"progressive\" reforms chipped away at the latter two functions, what with the binding primary system, which severely limits parties' ability to advance the candidates they want, creating inefficient and unnecessary shit-shows like the 2012 GOP primary, and caps on monetary donations to parties, which don't actually LIMIT the amount of money in politics so much as spread it around to other committees and interest groups. \n\nSounds like you're pretty dissatisfied with that setup, don't you think it could be reformed for the benefit of all?\n\n&gt;One thing you have to realize is that the presidential candidates' campaigns, the parties' presidential campaign committees, senatorial candidates' campaigns, parties' senatorial campaign committees, house candidates, the parties' house campaign committees, and all of the numerous interest groups, are all trying to get donations from the same pool of donors with money to spend. \n\nAnd? The doctrine of freedom of speech+ under the first amendment entitles persons to spend their money 'as speech.' I agree that capping campaign contributions in the context of our electoral framework is presently pushing contributions toward special interests, but I don't necessarily think that any or all caps on campaign contributions have to have that effect.\n\n&gt;So why would people want to make all elections publicly funded? This completely ruins parties' ability to prioritize the candidacies of certain politicians that the party values in advancing the policies that the MAJORITY of people want their preferred parties to be pushing.\n\nI think when people espouse the view that elections should be publicly funded they envision that policy as a silver bullet to create a level monetary playing feild for all candidates (obviously it isn't that simple, but a level playing feild isn't an awful goal to set wouldn't you say? After all 'we're a capitalist country herp derp'.)\n\n&gt;And it doesn't prevent money from going to interest groups either.\n\nAnd it shouldn't because public finance has nothing to do with PAC reform et al. If you want to reform 501c and the like then that's a policy option that isn't directly related to public finance. I think quite a few redditors that you've come across probably want to clamp down on private money in politics and phase in public finance but I'm not convinced that that would be constructive.\n\n&gt;Which brings us to a second discussion about parties that people (wrongly, if you ask me) use as inspiration for their proposed electoral reforms: they don't like that there are only two parties.\n\nSo link them to an article on Duverger's law and move on (I see that happen all the time on reddit, there's a youtube video that's often used for that purpose because it has cuddly animals.)\n\n&gt;so they brainstorm ways to give their ideas undeserved influence in government. \n\nI don't think *any* lessening of the barriers to entry amounts to giving third parties undue influence, it's much more nuanced than that. For example, why can't the Comt. On Presidential Debates go to a more proportional representation [(or just stop playing keep-away with the mic.)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_on_Presidential_Debates#Lawsuits)\n\n&gt;But is having only two parties as bad as everyone says it is?\n\nIt doesn't really matter, recall the Duverger's is a *law.* The real question is how much power should the major parties have to create barriers to entry for third party candidates?\n\n&gt;politically educated people who know enough about electoral reform to discuss it openly on a forum like this.\n\nThat's never stopped anybody before. Besides, the founders intended for the USA system to be representative even for persons who aren't fully congnizent of the nuance involved in the political process or governance (this is because *anybody can be mobilized by leaders, no matter their level of education.*) If low information voters are coming over to the side of given issue that's not much more than a minor indicator of how viable the position is.\n\n&gt;Those typical people instead largely rely on party, retrospective evaluations of parties' and politicians' performance in office, and \"who\" parties stand for (not so much \"what\" they stand for specifically) as guides for their voting decisions.\n\n[Coincidentally this topic already came up on this thread!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1iwt1z/what_is_the_most_viable_path_to_election_reform/cb8zpb7) You're talking about the purposive motivation for voting. I agree, a functionally representative government must, at least in part, make use of this mechanic.\n\n&gt;Not to mention, the \"big\" ideas that people look to third parties for are not the issues on which a major party would readily compromise anyway, so it's not like forcing minority parties to make majority coalitions is going to magically bring about the changes that the third-wayists on reddit want anyway.\n\n'Third-way' refers to a centrist position rather than a position in favor of third parties. Having said that, third parties aren't intended to govern in conjunction with major parties (in the USA,) they are intended to replace one of the major parties when they collapse (which has happened periodically throughout our history.) At this time it is my assesment that third parties aren't viable federally so I don't offer them much support, but they are legitimate on the basis of the aforementioned.", "id": "t1_cb95w15", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cb93g39", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430355481, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1374657891, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cb95w15", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1374657697", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Part two:\n\n\n&gt;All of this is true, while the criticism that two parties are ideologically restrictive (at least in some \"unjust\" way) is probably not even terrible accurate -- or at least, it's not a bad thing in the grand scheme of things; the two party system probably, theoretically, works just fine, and here's why. A lot of partisan politics happens at the state level (not in state government necessarily, but with the state as the level of analysis) because politicians must respond to varying constituencies to win their elections. A Mississippi Republican does not look the same as a Massachusetts Republican.\n\nDamn right they look different! I agree that saying one or another party is 'ideologically restrictive' doesn't pass the smell test, the real question is whether they are responsive and representative.\n\n&gt;As a result, even though the aggregate title of \"Republican\" and \"Democrat\" represent behemoth, relatively centrist catch-all constituencies, there is still some nontrivial variation in the values that different politicians have as a function of where they come from.\n\nOf course there is, the problem arises when they all tie themselves together with money. For example, after the Sandy Hook disaster (and the apertaining legislative trainwreck) there was a whisper campaign to cut bluedogs off from D triple C funds. Didn't happen. There is as much of a nontrival association among Ds and Rs as there are differences.\n\n&gt;It's not necessarily true that the politicians third-party-advocates want aren't out there. They're just running as Rs or Ds.\n\nThe candidates third-party-advocates *really* want (or should) are candidates who will help to break up one of the major parties (the one that is closest to their own ideology of course) by running against them from the 'fringe'. So your point here is either lost on me or it doesn't ring true for that reason.\n\n&gt;If a constituency has the potential to elect these people under a third party, then they should certainly have greater potential to elect them under a major party.\n\nAgain, how are you reaching that conclusion? If there is a level of support for a third party that constitutes a majority (in some district X) then that logically entails that there is *not* a majority constituency for a major party. 'There can be only one' (majority per constituency,) this much is mathematically certain.\n\n&gt;But belonging to a major party is actually better, because now the desired candidate gets to caucus with a legitimate party (i.e. he has the ears of people who matter more than a lone-body) and also gets a piece of the party's fundraising pie.\n\nYou must never have heard of Senator Bernie Sanders (who caucuses with the Ds but is a Socialist.) Or the Tea Party.\n\n&gt;Third parties cannot boast that.\n\nThe Tea Party can. So can the above mentioned Sen. Sanders.\n\n&gt;So in short, if you think the electorate can stomach the candidates that these reformists want, then they probably already are stomaching those candidates...They have unpopular ideas, and are thus failing because they aren't being endorsed by the public.\n\nThis ignores so much nuance: are there no barriers to entry besides public support? Does it not cost a significant amount of money to run a race in any media market of significant size? Are there no administrative barriers that would be more difficult for an L than a D or an R? Are ALL of these barriers to entry legitimate and just? (Shouldn't we consider reducing them as part of election reform *if* it goes forward?)\n\n&gt;That's how democracy works, and it's not necessarily a fault in the system that some ideas are unelectable at this point in time.\nWhat ideas do you say are unelectable at this time? I'm not clear on what you're talking about specifically.\n\n&gt;The fact remains that the major parties by and large reflect the majority of the population's political opinions and values, and rigging the system to give a fringe ideology more influence either (a) is redundant and counter-productive because those politicians already exist within the parties that are being railed against, or (b) is in direct defiance of the country's general majoritarianism.\n\nThat's the question:  do the major parties remain representative? In congress they certainly aren't: [they can't even pass a fucking farm bill.](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/306981-farm-bill-setback-opens-gop-to-attacks-about-ability-to-lead) Ornstien and Mann published some good analysis in 2012 about how successive anti-incumbency waves strongly indicate that voters are frustrated with their level of representation and, for lack of a better option, are 'throwing out the bums' with increasing frequency. I would certainly agree that we shouldn't be rigging the the system but third party advocates aren't calling for a re-rigging, they're calling for an un-rigging (as far as I can tell.) Have a look at what I mean: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_on_Presidential_Debates#Lawsuits\n\nNow, just because they espouse those positions doesn't mean they don't have ulterior motives, but I think it's clear that you're mischaracterizing their proposals (if not their intention.)\n\n&gt;Good ideas don't deserve to be policy without popular endorsement just because [some small internet community that thinks' it has all the answers] thinks they're good ideas. That's just authoritarian.\n\nWho are the obnoxious people you've been speaking to, that you think this conversation is remotely about making internet collectives like reddit the arbiters of USA politics? No serious person could hope to defend that view as an intellectual proposition IMHO. If you're serious about this part then you've been wildly misled or perhaps trolled.\n\n&gt;Sorry for the essay, and sorry to anybody reading it if it was hard to follow. I just find it off-putting that there are so many people who roguishly push for electoral reforms without taking a step back and realizing that these institutions are working together in a way that is practical and (mostly) internally coherent.\n\nNo need to be sorry. Practicality and coherence are good things, but without a quality of responsiveness and representation we're right back where we started: shouting \"NO [fill in the blank] WITHOUT REPRESENTATION.\"\n\n&gt;A small segment of people want to reform the electoral system because they want to legitimize their generally unpopular or unfeasible ideas. \n\nhttp://www.gallup.com/poll/159881/americans-call-term-limits-end-electoral-college.aspx\n\nRather than getting my information about public sentiment from 'some small internet communty' I prefer to get it from major polling firms like Gallup. The headline of this article is: \"Americans Call for Term Limits, End to Electoral College, Virtually no partisan disagreement on these long-discussed constitutional reforms.\" Bullet point one rest on air.\n\n&gt;The two-party system probably works not-too-badly in fielding these ideas in the first place. If these ideas can survive in democracy, then these ideas are probably already being represented by the fringe ideologues within the parties, since partisan politics as it stands permits some ideological variation within the parties on account of parties haven't been allowed pick their candidates for themselves since like, the 70s.\n\nI can sympathize with your criticism of 70s electoral regulations and reforms but that's an arguement *for* election reform (in this case to address flaws in those policies,) not against it. The two party system is engrained, there's no need to argue in favor of it because Duverger's law is a *law.* Point 2 runs contrary to your thesis.\n\n&gt;The majority of people happily endorse their preferred party.\nPoint three is a tautology. As a standalone it is as pertinent as the statement \"Democrats like democrat stuff.\"\n\n&gt;Weakening parties just to weaken them is counterproductive to the parties' existential effort to enact the political visions of their constituents, which, pursuant to point 3, encapsulates the majority of the polity.\n\nPoint four takes for a premise the false assumption that politics is a zero-sum game. By strengthening competition and reducing barriers to entry all parties stand to increase their efficacy and influence.\n\n&gt;Our legislative institutions are not designed to handle multiple parties, and multiple parties don't function as well within our legislative institutions. And changing the institutions doesn't seem like the best idea either, since we don't see the majority of the population wanting a parliamentary system (or multiple parties for that matter) any time soon.\n\nPoint five isn't particularly objectionable in any way IMO, but it hardly substantiates the notion that we should, for some reason, avoid making adjustments to our electoral system.\n\n&gt;So why be hasty to reform electoral institutions if the people (on reddit at least ~~LOL~~) who are trying to hard to make it happen don't even really acknowledge how electoral systems fit into the broader philosophy of our governmental institutions or party systems?\n\nThere are low information voters among the ranks of every faction on every issue and you know that, so this point doesn't really ring true. Argue in good faith, if you please. I certainly have taken a good deal of time to study my civic environment before coming here, so I would appreciate it if you would paint with a finer brushstroke.\n\n&gt; We need to pass muster on this AT MINIMUM if we're going to take sweeping electoral reforms seriously. We should be willing to listen to ideas that people think will legitimately make democracy better for the country, but for real, we need to be able to distinguish \"make democracy better for the country\" from \"make democracy better for MYSELF\" if we want to take these ideas seriously.\n\nIf 'we' means the intellectual leadership of a given activity on a given issue then I would always agree with the above, but all viable political movments in the US become and stay viable by appealing to low information voters.\n\n", "id": "t1_cb95ylw", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cb93g39", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430355448, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1iwt1z", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cb95ylw", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1374658204", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cb93fya", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1430356707, "controversiality": 0, "body": "(2/2) All of this is true, while the criticism that two parties are ideologically restrictive (at least in some \"unjust\" way) is probably not even terrible accurate -- or at least, it's not a bad thing in the grand scheme of things; the two party system probably, theoretically, works just fine, and here's why.

The fact remains that the major parties by and large reflect the majority of the population's political opinions and values, and rigging the system to give a fringe ideology more influence either (a) is redundant and counter-productive because those politicians already exist within the parties that are being railed against, or (b) is in direct defiance of the country's general majoritarianism. Good ideas don't deserve to be policy without popular endorsement just because [some small internet community that thinks' it has all the answers] thinks they're good ideas. That's just authoritarian.\n\nSorry for the essay, and sorry to anybody reading it if it was hard to follow. I just find it off-putting that there are so many people who roguishly push for electoral reforms without taking a step back and realizing that these institutions are working together in a way that is practical and (mostly) internally coherent. So uh, why don't I try my best to bullet-point the argument in a more concise way, and it can be up to y'all to see if I've actually explained this in an understandable way? \n\n1. A small segment of people want to reform the electoral system because they want to legitimize their generally unpopular or unfeasible ideas. \n2. The two-party system probably works not-too-badly in fielding these ideas in the first place. If these ideas can survive in democracy, then these ideas are probably already being represented by the fringe ideologues within the parties, since partisan politics as it stands permits some ideological variation within the parties on account of parties haven't been allowed pick their candidates for themselves since like, the 70s. If their unpopular ideas can't survive in democracy, we're going to need a hellofalot better justification to change the system to make room for them.\n3. The majority of people happily endorse their preferred party.\n4. Weakening parties just to weaken them is counterproductive to the parties' existential effort to enact the political visions of their constituents, which, pursuant to point 3, encapsulates the majority of the polity.\n5. Our legislative institutions are not designed to handle multiple parties, and multiple parties don't function as well within our legislative institutions. And changing the institutions doesn't seem like the best idea either, since we don't see the majority of the population wanting a parliamentary system (or multiple parties for that matter) any time soon.\n\nSo why be hasty to reform electoral institutions if the people (on reddit at least ~*~LOL~*~) who are trying to hard to make it happen don't even really acknowledge how electoral systems fit into the broader philosophy of our governmental institutions or party systems? We need to pass muster on this AT MINIMUM if we're going to take sweeping electoral reforms seriously. We should be willing to listen to ideas that people think will legitimately make democracy better for the country, but for real, we need to be able to distinguish \"make democracy better for the country\" from \"make democracy better for MYSELF\" if we want to take these ideas seriously.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1iwt1z", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cb93g39", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1374644889", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Once again I would like to thank you for your participation and I will add that I look forward to further debate on this topic after such time as you are able to craft a response to my initial rebuttal.", "id": "t1_cb95z6j", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cb93fya", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430355440, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1iwt1z", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cb95z6j", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1374658317", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t3_1iwt1z", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1430356707, "controversiality": 0, "body": "(1/2) Reddit isn't a great place to find credible opinions on election reform because 1) it's pretty easy to tell who's seen the inside of a relevant political science classroom and 2) everybody's grand idea is mostly a front to earn legislative seats for their pet ideology, i.e. not actually to make democracy work better for everybody considering our already existing confines. You can tell this because none of the most popular ideas take into account the fact that electoral systems, party systems, and legislative institutions are all influences on each other, and none should be reformed without considering the effects on the others. \n\n**I'm sorry in advance that this is going to be kind of a long demonstration of the point**, but it just can't be made in a very short space. My response is actually too long to fit into one comment, so I've tacked another comment to the bottom of this one, I expect people to ignore the argument or misunderstand it anyway. But the point, just to get it out there, is that we should be seriously asking ourselves whether the reforms we're so willing to advance are actually going to be sensible considering the institutions we have and what we want to get out of them. \n\nMore on what I mean: from the standpoint of voting and elections, an American political party has three primary purposes: serving as an ideological guide post to connect voters with coalitions within government institutions, nominating candidates for office, and funding campaigns. The latter two points strengthen political parties, making them more effective at the first, most important, purpose. But throughout the 20th century, \"progressive\" reforms chipped away at the latter two functions, what with the binding primary system, which severely limits parties' ability to advance the candidates they want, creating inefficient and unnecessary shit-shows like the 2012 GOP primary, and caps on monetary donations to parties, which don't actually LIMIT the amount of money in politics so much as spread it around to other committees and interest groups. One thing you have to realize is that the presidential candidates' campaigns, the parties' presidential campaign committees, senatorial candidates' campaigns, parties' senatorial campaign committees, house candidates, the parties' house campaign committees, and all of the numerous interest groups, are all trying to get donations from the same pool of donors with money to spend. Capping donations to candidates and party committees just takes money that would have gone to organizations that people trust more and can hold more accountable (parties and politicians, since they can be voted out) and diverts it to organizations that aren't as transparent, aren't held electorally accountable, and have the potential cause significant strife in politicians' ability to make sensible policies (which is not to say that all interest groups are bad, only that we should question whether our reforms are actually giving them more power than they deserve in the grand scheme of things). So why would people want to make all elections publicly funded? This completely ruins parties' ability to prioritize the candidacies of certain politicians that the party values in advancing the policies that the MAJORITY of people want their preferred parties to be pushing. And it doesn't prevent money from going to interest groups either. Which brings us to a second discussion about parties that people (wrongly, if you ask me) use as inspiration for their proposed electoral reforms: they don't like that there are only two parties (because they feel like they aren't being represented by the parties in aggregate), so they brainstorm ways to give their ideas undeserved influence in government. \n\nBut is having only two parties as bad as everyone says it is? Most people are not intimately aware of policy details, and they're certainly not as aware as the politically educated people who know enough about electoral reform to discuss it openly on a forum like this. Those typical people instead largely rely on party, retrospective evaluations of parties' and politicians' performance in office, and \"who\" parties stand for (not so much \"what\" they stand for specifically) as guides for their voting decisions. Having only two parties has the benefit of consolidating democratic revolt into a coalition that actually has the potential to make changes. And from the macro perspective that sees democracy as kind of bumbling around in good faith to legitimately represent the views of the people in government (in the long historical fight against tyranny), consolidating democratic revolt is a huge deal! While it's true that simply devising reforms to give a third party seats can fracture an undesired party's majority support, our legislative institutions don't create the same incentives for multiple minority parties to join forces into a majority coalition -- because the American system is not parliamentary. In multiparty parliamentary systems, forming a majority coalition is an absolute must because you need a prime minister to serve as the elected executive of the government, and the formation of the majority coalition influences the appointment of cabinet officials and the overall direction of the government until terms expire or the government is rejected in a vote of no confidence. The American presidential system has none of that. It's designed with a relatively large number of veto points because it was created to be inefficient. It's hard enough to get one party's legislators in line for a vote, and forcing legislative leaders to constantly cross party lines to get every initiative passed is going to foster more dealmaking that results in pork. Not to mention, the \"big\" ideas that people look to third parties for are not the issues on which a major party would readily compromise anyway, so it's not like forcing minority parties to make majority coalitions is going to magically bring about the changes that the third-wayists on reddit want anyway.\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cb93fya", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1374644876", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cb9blp7", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;We could discuss any number of US Constitutional Amendments that would affect elections or campaign finance, but the bar for passing an amendment is pretty high, and would require a level of bi-partisan support which the US has not seen in many-many years. \n\nDone through the state governments (which are more responsive) I think that such a push has the requisite support.

A Gallup Poll; arguably the worst polling firm in 2012. \n\nSetting aside semantics, I don't see you producing a counter-factual (such as a poll showing broad *disapproval* for election reform.)\n\n&gt;Further, you're using a national polling sample to assume that 3/4ths of all states would pass a US Constitutional Amendment individually, so not only is the sample sub-standard, but the population being sampled is not the correct one. \n\nNo, I'm using it to demonstrate to you that the problem with election reform has more to do with the administrative/legislative hurtles you mention and less to do with Joe American being able to get behind it.\n\n&gt;There's currently no equivocal driving force to pass a 28th Amendment establishing term limits for Representatives and Senators. \n\nThe nolabels caucus has that on their plank. An 81 member caucus in the federal legislature doesn't satisfy you? The issue has been snowballing and the 'catalyst' has been a gridlocked congress. I'm not sure congressional term limits are the answer but you're looking at the issue sideways and ignoring anything that doesn't jive with your argument.\n\n&gt;It's reckless to assume that 75+ state legislative branches, comprised of long-term incumbent legislators, would vote to establish term limits for legislative branches.  \n\nIt's not an assumption, it's a goal. \n\n&gt;Even if the amendment only applied to the federal legislature, if passed, it would obviously evoke effort for state-level legislative term limit reform as well - a chance most legislators wouldn't risk.\n\nI don't see that as obvious and I don't see passing federal term limits as necessarily risky for state legislators (at least, not as risky as losing the office they already have.) Substantiate your point.\n\n&gt;This thread is about viability, not about which concepts can be demonstrably favored in a polling sample.\n\nAbsolutely, but you're here talking about how all the ideas that are already in the works aren't viable ENOUGH for your high standards.

Of course it's a popular concept - I don't dispute this.\n\nWell then I have no use for polling data and we can move on.\n\n&gt;Further, we're talking about a Constitutional Amendment, which has much higher threshold for passage than bills in the normative legislative process. \n\nAbsolutely.\n\n&gt;My satisfaction is irrelevant. I'm simply discussing political viability. 81 members cannot pass laws, much less propose Amendment. You would need 353 members (in the correct chambers) to put forth an Amendment for ratification, and then you would need 38 states to accept the Amendment and vote to ratify. \n\nAbsolutely, but I perceived you argument as something to the effect of: 'election reform is non-viable.' I don't believe either of us ought to look at viability as a binary property. The purpose of this thread is to ask what is the *most* viable path to a given goal (election reform.)\n\n&gt;State legislatures have an equally high incumbency rate, and are often more entrenched and protected. In my state, more than half of the state legislators run unopposed every 2/4 years. \n\nThat sounds like a reason why state legislators *wouldn't* be worried about policies being enacted against their political interests, especially by the constitutional congress. What exactly is the scenario that you're envisioning (I think I am missing your specific point.)\n\n&gt;Your asking career politicians at the state level to spearhead an effort to eliminate career politicians at the federal level. Many state legislators owe their position in elected office to the efforts to their party's federal legislators.\n\n&gt;For example, there isn't a single Republican legislator in Kentucky that would vote to term-limit Mitch McConnell's career in the US Senate, given that McConnell is by-far the most powerful Republican in KY and the KY GOP owes nearly every dollar they have to McConnell.\n\n&gt;Likewise, you aren't going to find many Democratic legislators in California that would vote to term limit Nancy Pelosi or Barbara Boxer - because they too enjoy the benefits of their federal counterparts' seniority. \n\nSo, because of the problems that election reform is intended to address, election reform isn't possible? Again, this thread is for persons interested in discussing what the maximally viable proposal for election reform might look like. Nay-saying is a legitimate point of view but if you have nothing to contribute then I have nothing to say to you.\n\n&gt;Are there a few reform-minded/progressive state legislators that would vote for an Amendment establishing federal term limits - yes of course. But you need a super majority, and you need it in at least 38 states. \n\nThat's only one way forward, another way is to continue growing the 'problem solvers caucus' which didn't exist only a few years ago.\n\n&gt;It's not my standard we are discussing - It's Article V of the U.S. Constitution. That is the standard. I'm simply placing the standard of Article V into political context for the purposes of accessing viability. It is in my professional opinion that at this time, a U.S. Constitutional Amendment establishing term limits for federal office is simply not viable. \n\nAnd that is certainly a legitimate point of view. My point is that if you're only talking about what ISN'T viable (from your POV) and not what is comparatively MORE viable than the other options then you're just trolling the thread because you have nothing pertinent to say.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Unfortunately, most of your post consists of straw-man arguments.\n\nFirstly, the obvious ones: I wrote this paragraph, below, with the portion you saw fit to quote in bold.\n\n&gt;**The president gets the brunt of my criticism** when it comes to military matters because he's CIC. Having said that the congress ceded much of their powers to the presidency anyway.\n\nTo which you, ignoring my mention of the Congress and their constitutionally exclusive power to declare war, wrote this response\n\n&gt;Military matters, at least in the context of deciding whether to go to war or not, are not really in the President's power to change. Nation-States act rationally in their own interests and the foreign policy bureaucracy that advises the President is rooted in centuries of scientific research on the subject. The president is the actual voice making the call, but he has as little choice in the matter as a rock has a choice to fall (unless he wants to willingly work against the interests of the country). The real power the president has is in challenging the bureaucracy to get better information to act on, because lack of good information is what causes bad decisions to be made. Individuals have very little power in international politics except in the context of establishing norms.\n\nClearly you're arguing with somebody, but it obviously isn't me, or at least any position I've advanced. I'm sure somebody can benefit from the civics lesson anyway. From a moral standpoint when we consider signature strikes or Gitmo the POTUS is primary because, as you point out, he gives the actual orders. That doesn't absolve congress nor have I, I simply said that the POTUS gets the brunt (and should.)\n\nLet's have the next one:\n\n&gt;You have to realize that these individuals are politically powerful because they represent the interests of voters and a subset of the population trusts them to tell them how to vote. Political power and votes are exactly the same thing.\n\nI already do realize this, but Grover Norquist and Cecile Richards are my examples because they clearly are not the sort of people you describe. Rather, they are the people who have been presented as such on the basis of their ability to raise funds rather than to rally voters. Political power is in the votes, I agree, but the precursor is no longer good ideas or qualifications but strong enough funding. (Without the money you aren't viable.) \n\nHere's one that's pretty glaring and petty:\n\n&gt;Then I don't think you understand the concept of a \"law\". It's a law in the scientific sense, not the legal sense. It's descriptive, not prescriptive. It describes the chain of causality between plurality voting and two-party systems.\n\nNo, as I already said, I'm familiar with Duverger's law. I don't think you're grasping the concept of *surrender.* We should not consider Duverger's law a reason to turn away from third parties, to forget about federal election reform, or to otherwise ignore the unhealthy state of the two major parties, one of which is stagnate and needs more primary challengers (the democrats) and the other of which is imploding from too much infighting (the republicans.)\n\nHere's the next one:\n\n&gt;Just because you wrote a letter to your representative and it didn't change his mind doesn't mean the thousands of letters written to the same guy that oppose your viewpoint weren't effective.\n\nI'm not arguing that *my* interests aren't being served. I'm arguing that the people aren't being served. As in their well-being, education and livelihood.\n\n&gt;You have to realize the immense scale of people governments deal with, also that humans are inherently really shitty at contemplating immense scales.\n\nI'm aware of this dynamic. Still, the government isn't representative or acting in the interest of the people in their districts when they, for example, fail to pass a budget or pass unfunded mandates to essential agencies like, let's say, the post office. Rhetorical and semantic acrobatics can dress that up, but the problem will remain.\n\nAs an aside: I would hardly say that identifying a problem and advocating reasoned discussion of the same is cynical. Dismal approval ratings for congress are holding and (despite your argument to the contrary which seems to leave out that this congress presently serving is on track to be the least productive in US history and \"can't even pass a fucking farm bill\") low levels of legislative productivity provide the foundation for my concern. So no, my position is neither cynical nor unfounded.\n\nAnother one: you wrote of the multi-party system\n\n&gt;(Even if you go against the interests of your constituents, as long as you hold the party line, you can be moved up the lists so your seat is guaranteed even if the party does poorly in your district).\n\nTo which I wrote\n\n&gt;We've gotten around that drawback by drawing more safe seats.\n\nAnd you then replied\n\n&gt;Gerrymandering can't protect you from primaries.\n\nWell that isn't what I said at all is it? The question isn't whether or not gerrymandering can protect you from a primary challenge, it's whether it can insulate you from having to respond to the needs of the people in your district. If gerrymandering didn't insulate elected officials from pressure to run a more representative office then why would anybody bother with it? The express purpose is to dilute the voting power of a particular bloc...\n\nThat covers most of it.

After all, how representative government is will be a matter of degrees and not a binary. You're right that I've already made up my mind: I'm for a maximally representative government. It is not a fantasy for me to say that I have enough information to conclude that government could be and ought to be more representative, even if I'm not familiar with every detail of the machinations (which isn't practical for anybody.)\n\n&gt;The \"reality on the ground\" is that the system is, for the most part, not the problem. The problem is that many opinionated people aren't educated in basic civics and thus get frustrated when their ideas aren't listened to (because they're using the system wrong).\n\nWell based on this we can confirm that your previously quoted apology was intended to be backhanded, but let's set that aside. You're telling me that the system isn't the problem, but what REALLY frustrates you is the opinionated people who didn't receive adequate civics education and are now complaining about how the system that gave them that education doesn't respond to their needs and they don't understand how to use it? That sounds like you're making my case for a more responsive government...\n\nEdit: I forgot to ask.\n\nLet's grant you that government IS representative and that this is satisfactory. Aren't voters then morally obliged to withhold their vote from candidates that would engage in immoral behavior (e.g. double taps)?\n\nAnnnd I missed one\n\n&gt;Voting against incumbents in Primary elections is a far more effective strategy to protest the status quo than sitting out of elections.\n\nAs though I were suggesting one should not vote in primaries? Nowhere is that the case. Calling for federal election reform and some recognition that there are systemic problems (gerrymandering, you acknowledge, could be addressed more thoroughly for instance) does not preclude one from voting in primaries.

The president gets the brunt of my criticism when it comes to military matters because he's CIC. Having said that the congress ceded much of their powers to the presidency anyway.\n\n&gt;The president is a check against both the \"tyranny of the majority\" and bureaucratic insulation from society.\n\nMoreso the Senate than the Presidency given that the Senate was set up 2-per-state as a direct counterpoint to the House's representation based on population. I'm not sure what you mean by insulation from society but I'll respond to that if you clarify. This brings me to\n\n&gt;you seem to be confused about the purposes of the Legislature and the Presidency. The legislature is what controls most policy.\n\nI read this as condescension. Did you actually read the post? If I were saying that I only apply the rationale in that post to presidential elections then I would find this criticism valid.\n\n&gt;\"lesser of two evils\" style voting is effective in putting the better candidate in the position\n\nThat's a pretty low bar and the approval ratings (historically low and holding there) for congress would seem to directly contradict that claim.\n\n&gt; One could argue that Proportional Representation would be good for presidential elections while maintaining Single-Member District Plurality for the Legislature because it give a wider pool of applicants without damaging the public's ability to impact policy (the president won't listen to you, personally, no matter what because that's not his job).\n\nThere are many policy options available, but no political will or momentum in the judiciary. Back up to the top\n\n&gt;Yes, but by definition, \"widely supported\" means \"a majority\". With protections in place for minority opinions, this can take a while between a policy idea's inception and it actually getting enough support to pass with most ideas failing to gain enough popular support. If you support an unpopular idea and surround yourself with others who share your opinion, it can create an illusion that your idea has popular support when it does not and thus it appears that the system is against you.\n\nAren't laws being passed at a historically low rate? Even by that definition (which I wouldn't readily accept) wouldn't that statistic countermand the claim that widely supported laws are being passed?\n\n&gt;The American system is built so individuals are represented equally.\n\nYou're going to tell me straight-faced that I get equal representation in government when I compare my influence to Grover Norquist? Cecile Richards? The American system is built so that individuals are represented *on the basis of their political power.* That means voting blocs that can mobilize and effectively execute strategies. The principle of one person one vote doesn't get you to equal representation.\n\n&gt;As for political parties, the voting system, known as Single-Member District Plurality (or called by the dysphemism \"First Past the Post\" that betrays a horrible misunderstanding of statistics) forces there to be two parties in power due to Duverger's Law.\n\nI'm familiar to Duverger's Law and I don't think that we have to throw our hands up and surrender to it. Having said that I don't think that the two-party duopoly has to fall into the ocean for the problems with the electoral system to be resolved or for the government to be representative. We can live with Duverger's law and still deliver a great deal of choice.\n\n&gt;However, in practice it doesn't turn out like that. In two-party systems, many different factions come together to form coalitions before elections occur (rather than afterwards, like in multi-party systems). Primary elections are the most important process in determining government policy. The winner-take-all nature of elections also means that a representative is accountable to his constituents and needs to keep in contact and cater to their interests if they want to stay in office.\n\nIt would be great if that was how it was working but it isn't.\n\n&gt;This means that voters have power all the time instead of just during election season (evidence for this happening can be seen in approval ratings for people's own representatives, which are usually quite high despite the low approval of congress in general). Multi-party systems make their representatives accountable to their party leadership alone (*Even if you go against the interests of your constituents, as long as you hold the party line, you can be moved up the lists so your seat is guaranteed even if the party does poorly in your district*).\n\nWe've gotten around that drawback by drawing more safe seats. Now, despite the fact that we don't have a multi-party system, our reps can freely go against the interests of their constituents.\n\nOn the whole, I feel familiar with this argument, although I commend you for being particularly articulate in delivering it. I found it convincing when it's underpinnings were consistent with the realities on the ground. Clearly, that is not the case.\n\nEdit:\n\n&gt;The US system is extremely representative, especially when compared to many other liberal democracies.\n\nEven accepting this assertion (which I'm not inclined to do) does the comparative quality of representation reflect the intrinsic quality of representation?

Nation-States act rationally in their own interests and the foreign policy bureaucracy that advises the President is rooted in centuries of scientific research on the subject. The president is the actual voice making the call, but he has as little choice in the matter as a rock has a choice to fall (unless he wants to willingly work against the interests of the country). The real power the president has is in challenging the bureaucracy to get better information to act on, because lack of good information is what causes bad decisions to be made. Individuals have very little power in international politics except in the context of establishing norms.\n\n&gt;Moreso the Senate...\n\nIf we had an unelected technocratic body similar to the House of Lords, then this would be true. The point of the \"tyranny of the majority\" counter is that you have someone who is an expert on policy making policy decisions and not the uneducated masses. The President can accomplish this while still maintaining the legitimacy of popular election.\n\n&gt;That's a pretty low bar\n\nThis paragraph is talking exclusively about presidential elections. In Legislative elections, the candidate that best represents the interests of the constituency is elected. Now, the constituency only counts as people who vote, and *especially* people who vote in primaries because that's where the real competition for ideas is. Since you don't vote, your ideas don't matter and thus will not become policy. You can make your ideas matter by taking part in primaries. The real question is why more people don't take part in primaries. The answer to that is that incumbent seats are endangered by any change to the primary voting population (why throw in a wildcard when the group that actually cares about primaries voted you in last election), so primaries are nowhere near as well advertised. Voting against incumbents in Primary elections is a far more effective strategy to protest the status quo than sitting out of elections.\n\n&gt;Aren't laws being passed at a historically low rate?\n\n[No.](http://i.imgur.com/paVIfTT.jpg) There doesn't seem to be a real trend of number of bills passing except that 2009 was a historic low since pre-Civil War (2010-2012 have been about average for the past century). Even if they were declining, number of laws being passed doesn't necessarily mean that popular policy is being implemented. Lack of laws being passed can also mean that lots of debate time is being taken up defeating unpopular bills.\n\n&gt;when I compare my influence to \n\nYou have to realize that these individuals are politically powerful because they represent the interests of voters and a subset of the population trusts them to tell them how to vote. Political power and votes are exactly the same thing. Your vote is equal to a person who belongs in an interest group and listens to the advice of the leaders of that group. The trust these people have in the leaders in not unfounded, if they don't think the leader is representing their interests anymore, they'll just leave the group and the leader loses power as his supporters break away.\n\n&gt;I'm familiar to Duverger's Law and *I don't think that we have to throw our hands up and surrender to it*\n\nThen I don't think you understand the concept of a \"law\". It's a law in the scientific sense, not the legal sense. It's descriptive, not prescriptive. It describes the chain of causality between plurality voting and two-party systems.\n\n&gt;It would be great if that was how it was working but it isn't.\n\nThis is wrong. This is exactly how it works in practice. Your cynicism is unfounded. Just because you wrote a letter to your representative and it didn't change his mind doesn't mean the thousands of letters written to the same guy that oppose your viewpoint weren't effective. You have to realize the immense scale of people governments deal with, also that humans are inherently really shitty at contemplating immense scales.\n\n&gt;We've gotten around that drawback by drawing more safe seats.\n\nGerrymandering can't protect you from primaries. It's a bad practice and it would probably be better to let unelected bodies draw district boundaries, but it doesn't create the same protection from constituents that party lists do. It also isn't as common as it's often portrayed, though dense cities seem to attract this practice.\n\nI apologize if this any of this sounded condescending, but you seem to have made up your mind as to what you think actually happens when in reality those ideas are a cynical fantasy.

I'm sure somebody can benefit from the civics lesson anyway. From a moral standpoint when we consider signature strikes or Gitmo the POTUS is primary because, as you point out, he gives the actual orders. That doesn't absolve congress nor have I, I simply said that the POTUS gets the brunt (and should.)\n\nLet's have the next one:\n\n&gt;You have to realize that these individuals are politically powerful because they represent the interests of voters and a subset of the population trusts them to tell them how to vote. Political power and votes are exactly the same thing.\n\nI already do realize this, but Grover Norquist and Cecile Richards are my examples because they clearly are not the sort of people you describe. Rather, they are the people who have been presented as such on the basis of their ability to raise funds rather than to rally voters. Political power is in the votes, I agree, but the precursor is no longer good ideas or qualifications but strong enough funding. (Without the money you aren't viable.) \n\nHere's one that's pretty glaring and petty:\n\n&gt;Then I don't think you understand the concept of a \"law\". It's a law in the scientific sense, not the legal sense. It's descriptive, not prescriptive. It describes the chain of causality between plurality voting and two-party systems.\n\nNo, as I already said, I'm familiar with Duverger's law. I don't think you're grasping the concept of *surrender.* We should not consider Duverger's law a reason to turn away from third parties, to forget about federal election reform, or to otherwise ignore the unhealthy state of the two major parties, one of which is stagnate and needs more primary challengers (the democrats) and the other of which is imploding from too much infighting (the republicans.)\n\nHere's the next one:\n\n&gt;Just because you wrote a letter to your representative and it didn't change his mind doesn't mean the thousands of letters written to the same guy that oppose your viewpoint weren't effective.\n\nI'm not arguing that *my* interests aren't being served. I'm arguing that the people aren't being served. As in their well-being, education and livelihood.\n\n&gt;You have to realize the immense scale of people governments deal with, also that humans are inherently really shitty at contemplating immense scales.\n\nI'm aware of this dynamic. Still, the government isn't representative or acting in the interest of the people in their districts when they, for example, fail to pass a budget or pass unfunded mandates to essential agencies like, let's say, the post office. Rhetorical and semantic acrobatics can dress that up, but the problem will remain.\n\nAs an aside: I would hardly say that identifying a problem and advocating reasoned discussion of the same is cynical. Dismal approval ratings for congress are holding and (despite your argument to the contrary which seems to leave out that this congress presently serving is on track to be the least productive in US history and \"can't even pass a fucking farm bill\") low levels of legislative productivity provide the foundation for my concern. So no, my position is neither cynical nor unfounded.\n\nAnother one: you wrote of the multi-party system\n\n&gt;(Even if you go against the interests of your constituents, as long as you hold the party line, you can be moved up the lists so your seat is guaranteed even if the party does poorly in your district).\n\nTo which I wrote\n\n&gt;We've gotten around that drawback by drawing more safe seats.\n\nAnd you then replied\n\n&gt;Gerrymandering can't protect you from primaries.\n\nWell that isn't what I said at all is it?

The founders intended the government to introduce amendments for the express purpose of addressing flaws in the original design. The question isn't whether we are intended to have a representative government but whether or not we have one.\n\n&gt;I had a professor at University who was the alleged foremost expert on interest groups and he said that he didn't understand the change in character of Congress. Lobbies that traditionally have held sway have done one of two things: either 1) their importance has exploded or 2) their importance has been completely eliminated. One of the things that I think will be interesting to see over the next decade is the change in character that comes from the fundraising abilities of candidates like Barack Obama. Who - through mostly small donations (donations under $200) can push through a billion dollar campaign. Obviously the President had a great deal of large money donors - people like George Soros, Anna Wintour, etc. But, utilization of the internet explodes the grassroots (or netroots) capability of influencing elections. That is if elections come down to monied interests. I think they do. And, where is the allegiance of a candidate who doesn't receive all the large donations. Of course, that discussion will require a Republican to do the same. Candidates still have federal limits on donations. And liberal interest groups just don't have the financial resources that conservative ones do. \n\nThis is one of the more interesting lines of argument that comes up in my experience with this topic.

Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

Trust me, I actively avoid being marked as \"strong reject\". As for invalid ballots, I don't know who you listen to but I've heard democrats talk about election reform most when they make the observation that invalid votes are being cast (and that they know that most of those votes were intended for them.)  The newtime voter id laws are a great example of that. It clearly creates an incentive for them to pursue election reform when I present an invalid ballot.\n\n&gt;On a public basis...\n\nI don't see how any of this passage is pertinent.

I would rather you answer my fundamental question to you: what is the line that a candidate must cross before you will refuse to vote for them under any circumstance? Do you even have one?\n\nBut we don't have to compare our experiences in politics for me to be skeptical of your point. If candidates don't care about invalid votes, why would they ever move on the issue of election reform anyway? Thats why I cited movetoamend.org: they have a realistic goal that doesn't involve passing a bill through the three houses, and has the potential to enact real election reform.\n\nEdit: sorry about the long delay and poor formating/spelling.

Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

Trust me, I actively avoid being marked as \"strong reject\". As for invalid ballots, I don't know who you listen to but I've heard democrats talk about election reform most when they make the observation that invalid votes are being cast (and that they know that most of those votes were intended for them.)  The newtime voter id laws are a great example of that.

Do you even have one?\n\nBut we don't have to compare our experiences in politics for me to be skeptical of your point. If candidates don't care about invalid votes, why would they ever move on the issue of election reform anyway? Thats why I cited movetoamend.org: they have a realistic goal that doesn't involve passing a bill through the three houses, and has the potential to enact real election reform.\n\nEdit: sorry about the long delay and poor formating/spelling.

Trust me, I actively avoid being marked as \"strong reject\". As for invalid ballots, I don't know who you listen to but I've heard democrats talk about election reform most when they make the observation that invalid votes are being cast (and that they know that most of those votes were intended for them.)  The newtime voter id laws are a great example of that.

Do you even have one?\n\nBut we don't have to compare our experiences in politics for me to be skeptical of your point. If candidates don't care about invalid votes, why would they ever move on the issue of election reform anyway? Thats why I cited movetoamend.org: they have a realistic goal that doesn't involve passing a bill through the three houses, and has the potential to enact real election reform.\n\nEdit: sorry about the long delay and poor formating/spelling.

I know it's an absurd question but I'm posing an extreme example to you only to emphasize the point about the shortcomings of approaching voting as realpolitik.\n\nProbably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted]. Pol Pot killed about 25% of his population in 4 years whereas Stalin killed only 10-20% of his population over 30 years. That's a big difference! But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\n&gt;we don't live in a society that separates their moral judgments from their voting judgements.\n\nI disagree. People are highly strategic in their voting judgments, and a very high percentage of voters do so despite feeling that they're choosing between the \"lesser of two evils\".\n\n&gt;Of course not (this is a straw man argument, I don't reject the process of voting, on the contrary I want to improve it!)\n\nI mean the voting process *in its current state*.

The scarce few moments it's actually had a chance have had to be shared with several other vitally important issues that were just seeing a glimmer of the light of day.

I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality? Is it not entirely self-evident (from your POV) that voters care about these issues?\n\n&gt;By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\nI've explicitly disclaimed this notion in the CMV post, and in previous responses to you. How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality? Is it not entirely self-evident (from your POV) that voters care about these issues?\n\n&gt;By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\nI've explicitly disclaimed this notion in the CMV post, and in previous responses to you. How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

Trust me, I actively avoid being marked as \"strong reject\". As for invalid ballots, I don't know who you listen to but I've heard democrats talk about election reform most when they make the observation that invalid votes are being cast (and that they know that most of those votes were intended for them.)  The newtime voter id laws are a great example of that. It clearly creates an incentive for them to pursue election reform when I present an invalid ballot.\n\n&gt;On a public basis...\n\nI don't see how any of this passage is pertinent.

I would rather you answer my fundamental question to you: what is the line that a candidate must cross before you will refuse to vote for them under any circumstance? Do you even have one?\n\nBut we don't have to compare our experiences in politics for me to be skeptical of your point. If candidates don't care about invalid votes, why would they ever move on the issue of election reform anyway? Thats why I cited movetoamend.org: they have a realistic goal that doesn't involve passing a bill through the three houses, and has the potential to enact real election reform.\n\nEdit: sorry about the long delay and poor formating/spelling.

I know it's an absurd question but I'm posing an extreme example to you only to emphasize the point about the shortcomings of approaching voting as realpolitik.\n\nProbably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted]. Pol Pot killed about 25% of his population in 4 years whereas Stalin killed only 10-20% of his population over 30 years. That's a big difference! But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\n&gt;we don't live in a society that separates their moral judgments from their voting judgements.\n\nI disagree. People are highly strategic in their voting judgments, and a very high percentage of voters do so despite feeling that they're choosing between the \"lesser of two evils\".\n\n&gt;Of course not (this is a straw man argument, I don't reject the process of voting, on the contrary I want to improve it!)\n\nI mean the voting process *in its current state*.

The scarce few moments it's actually had a chance have had to be shared with several other vitally important issues that were just seeing a glimmer of the light of day. Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".

I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality? Is it not entirely self-evident (from your POV) that voters care about these issues?\n\n&gt;By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\nI've explicitly disclaimed this notion in the CMV post, and in previous responses to you. How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nThe obstruction of Republicans is *far* more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.", "id": "t1_cb7syi2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "johnpseudo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt; Probably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted]. Pol Pot killed about 25% of his population in 4 years whereas Stalin killed only 10-20% of his population over 30 years. That's a big difference! But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\nBy taking this position you've essentially admitted that your position is non-viable (go try to convince Joe America that you're justified in your willingness to vote for either Stalin or Pol Pot.) I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality? Is it not entirely self-evident (from your POV) that voters care about these issues?\n\n&gt;By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\nI've explicitly disclaimed this notion in the CMV post, and in previous responses to you. How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

From a purely practical perspective, they care much more about votes registered to one of the two major political parties. Protest votes just aren't a very reliable metric when trying to guess how much success any particular candidate or campaign platform is going to have. A well-funded candidate is going to start with the two-party results breakdown of past races, then if they have enough money they'll pay for some research about what the three most important issues are for voters in their district. If they've really got a lot of money they'll test verbiage for campaign platform planks addressing those issues.

I know it's an absurd question but I'm posing an extreme example to you only to emphasize the point about the shortcomings of approaching voting as realpolitik.\n\nProbably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted]. Pol Pot killed about 25% of his population in 4 years whereas Stalin killed only 10-20% of his population over 30 years. That's a big difference! But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\n&gt;we don't live in a society that separates their moral judgments from their voting judgements.\n\nI disagree.

I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality?

How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

So I see you arguing in favor of the party. That's what I've been arguing with for a few posts now. If you haven't been arguing in good faith about that then the position I've objected to rests on air.\n\n&gt;My position is that voting for Democratic candidates for federal office is a more effective course of action for electoral reform than abstaining from federal elections. Why would it matter if I donated at all?\n\nIt matters if you donate at all because there is no ballot that allows you to vote for the DNC. It is an institution and not a candidate.\n\n&gt;Maybe you feel better about yourself. Maybe a few of your like-minded friends understand and appreciate what you did. But nobody else is going to get your \"message\". The primary outcome of your not voting is going to be that your least-preferred candidate will be more likely to win their election and represent you in a way you'd prefer they didn't.\n\nAgain, this is very patronizing but it also skips the crucial question. If voting has moral consequence, then isn't a vote for Candidate X in part a statement that the voter condones the action of the candidate (especially in the case of incumbents because they have a record in government?)\n\n&gt;The simple truth is that you are only one of hundreds of millions of U.S. voters. So you aren't going to be able to \"enforce your will\" over the objections of everyone else.\n\nWe're back to what I would call a nihilistic view of voting here. Collectively we are intended to effect government by expressing our will through elections (voting.) The scale of that collective action isn't relevant, millions or billions or me and Joe and Tom and Susan. \n\n&gt;Everyone just has a marginal effect.\n\nYep. Will your small part be for crimes against humanity and soft money? I would be sorry to believe that my vote matters, but that I am so small that I myself do not matter. That I am only useful inasmuch as my faction is powerful.\n\n&gt;But we have a moral obligation to enact that small, marginal impact to the best of our abilities.\n\nYeah that's my point exactly. You have a moral duty to express your point of view through voting. I, for one, am not for condoning the actions of government when they commit crimes against humanity or when they subvert the processes of government or countermand their basis for legitimacy (the constitution.)\n\nEdit:\n\n&gt;No. That moral complicity is yours whether or not you vote, merely by virtue of the fact that you are a U.S. citizen.\n\nYou're telling me that if we elect Adolf Hitler that the people who vote for him are equally blameworthy (morally) as the people who vote against him?

What makes you think it's hard to 'get' that anyway? It's no harder than for a position on some other issue (e.g. pro-choice/life). To say that what I'm doing isn't a viable or effective ignores the enormous influence already garnered by organizers who espouse the usage of this tactic (e.g. the NRA.)\n\nPoint of process: I have made an effort to respond to each of your points in every case, and offered to address any point you feel unsatisfied with in greater depth. On the other hand, one of my critical questions for you\n\n&gt;I would rather you answer my fundamental question to you: what is the line that a candidate must cross before you will refuse to vote for them under any circumstance?\n\ngoes unanswered despite my having repeated it at least twice. Please respond.\n\nEdit: \n\n&gt;That seems like something a politician would say if they're already fans of election reform.\n\nWhy is that worth commenting on? A great deal of what you've said thus far could easily have been said by a partisan congressional democrat but I don't see the pertinence of either comment. If your point is that something like Bush v Gore wasn't a wake up call to politicians who weren't cognizant of the major problems our election system has institutionalized then I don't really see where you're getting that from.", "id": "t1_cb7rc4v", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt; You're right, what would really help is if they were sincere about wanting it.\n\nHave you any reason for doubting their sincerity other than your complaint about the ~3 months in 2009 when you think they could have passed election reform?\n\n&gt;how is single-issue voting on election reform less legitimate than on other issues?\n\nI never said it was. They're all ineffective uses of the vote.\n\n&gt;what is the line that a candidate must cross before you will refuse to vote for them under any circumstance?\n\nI already answered that:\n\n&gt;That depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that. If polls were to say that only 10-20% of the population supports [crossing that line], and that the issue is very important, I could see how abstaining from voting and focusing on getting a new constitutional convention would make sense. But if polls were to say that 70-80% of the population supports [crossing that line], then abstaining from the vote isn't going to accomplish anything.\n\nSo no, there's no line that, if crossed, would lead me to think that abstaining from the vote would be a good decision. It depends on the degree to which that objectionable policy is accepted by the rest of the country. I already am shocked/outraged/disgusted by much of what the government does, but unless a lot of other people feel the same way, that doesn't make rejecting the entire voting process any more of a viable a way of changing the system.

I know it's an absurd question but I'm posing an extreme example to you only to emphasize the point about the shortcomings of approaching voting as realpolitik.\n\nProbably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted]. Pol Pot killed about 25% of his population in 4 years whereas Stalin killed only 10-20% of his population over 30 years. That's a big difference! But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\n&gt;we don't live in a society that separates their moral judgments from their voting judgements.\n\nI disagree. People are highly strategic in their voting judgments, and a very high percentage of voters do so despite feeling that they're choosing between the \"lesser of two evils\".\n\n&gt;Of course not (this is a straw man argument, I don't reject the process of voting, on the contrary I want to improve it!)\n\nI mean the voting process *in its current state*.

The scarce few moments it's actually had a chance have had to be shared with several other vitally important issues that were just seeing a glimmer of the light of day. Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\". You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nThe obstruction of Republicans is *far* more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.", "id": "t1_cb7syi2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "johnpseudo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt; Probably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted].

I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality? Is it not entirely self-evident (from your POV) that voters care about these issues?\n\n&gt;By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\nI've explicitly disclaimed this notion in the CMV post, and in previous responses to you. How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

So you don't need to wait for the election results to have a rough idea how things will pan-out.\n\nYeah I'm not denying that polling is predictive I just think that it's a red herring. I don't see the relevance to voting (simply because polling exists doesn't make voting an entirely strategic, and morally vacuous process. I think both are equally obvious.)\n\n&gt;You can vote in whatever district you want?\n\nYou didn't say vote, you said move to.\n\n&gt;You don't think it's useless and I do.\n\nThat's because you're describing an entirely nihilistic view of voting.

I can't enforce my will, I can only affect the outcome on the margin.\n\nThe point of voting in the first place is to effect (read: enforce) your will onto the political and governmental process.

You have a moral duty to express your point of view through voting. I, for one, am not for condoning the actions of government when they commit crimes against humanity or when they subvert the processes of government or countermand their basis for legitimacy (the constitution.)\n\nEdit:\n\n&gt;No. That moral complicity is yours whether or not you vote, merely by virtue of the fact that you are a U.S. citizen.\n\nYou're telling me that if we elect Adolf Hitler that the people who vote for him are equally blameworthy (morally) as the people who vote against him?

But if polls were to say that 70-80% of the population supports [crossing that line], then abstaining from the vote isn't going to accomplish anything.\n\nSo no, there's no line that, if crossed, would lead me to think that abstaining from the vote would be a good decision. It depends on the degree to which that objectionable policy is accepted by the rest of the country. I already am shocked/outraged/disgusted by much of what the government does, but unless a lot of other people feel the same way, that doesn't make rejecting the entire voting process any more of a viable a way of changing the system. Since about half the country still votes Republican on a regular basis, even though the Democratic party advocates against most of what I find objectionable/shocking/disgusting, we obviously haven't reached that point.", "id": "t1_cb7rpm2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "johnpseudo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt;So no, there's no line that, if crossed, would lead me to think that abstaining from the vote would be a good decision.\n\nSo in a runoff between Pol Pot and Stalin who are you going to vote for?

I know it's an absurd question but I'm posing an extreme example to you only to emphasize the point about the shortcomings of approaching voting as realpolitik.\n\nProbably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted]. Pol Pot killed about 25% of his population in 4 years whereas Stalin killed only 10-20% of his population over 30 years. That's a big difference! But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\n&gt;we don't live in a society that separates their moral judgments from their voting judgements.\n\nI disagree. People are highly strategic in their voting judgments, and a very high percentage of voters do so despite feeling that they're choosing between the \"lesser of two evils\".\n\n&gt;Of course not (this is a straw man argument, I don't reject the process of voting, on the contrary I want to improve it!)\n\nI mean the voting process *in its current state*.

The scarce few moments it's actually had a chance have had to be shared with several other vitally important issues that were just seeing a glimmer of the light of day. Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\". You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nThe obstruction of Republicans is *far* more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.", "id": "t1_cb7syi2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "johnpseudo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt; Probably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted].

I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality? Is it not entirely self-evident (from your POV) that voters care about these issues?\n\n&gt;By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\nI've explicitly disclaimed this notion in the CMV post, and in previous responses to you. How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

Your vote counts for one person and can *only be cast once, and only for one person, and only from one person per person per election*. You can only vote *affirmatively* and therefore may not express preference, whereas in instant runoff voting none of the above is true and one MAY express preference by listing their preferences in order. When write-in ballots are permitted I always participate on the basis of the above rationale and that scenario presenting an exception to the same. Isn't voting clearly a selection? As in 'this one gets my vote, I want her!' In order to express the political will consistent with the expression 'I want this one but if I can't have it that way I'll take Nixon instead and then if they both lose I'll take Pol Pot' in the form of a ballot one would necessarily require a runoff style ballot would they not?\n\n&gt;That depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that.\n\nWhat the hell does that mean? We're voting, it's decision time. Secret ballots, nobody finds out until afterward. As to the point about polling you're missing the point. If voting is a meaningful expression of your political will at all then does it not affix some moral complicity to the voter when the government they put into office acts? If you're telling me that when you vote you do not make a moral affirmation of the candidate that has earned your vote then how do you enforce your will that your government should be a force for good? (I don't vote for candidates that I believe will engage in crimes against humanity such as double-taps. This is an extremely low bar.) We don't make moral judgments as a group we make them as individuals.\n\n&gt;I would never donate money to or actively promote a conservative Democrat in another state.\n\nLike I said, D triple C money is still flowing freely to these people. If you support the Democratic Party (DNC, DCCC) in reality as you have in this argument, then your money is making the journey to those Bluedogs anyway.\n\n&gt;I can't choose which district I'm voting in, and I can't afford to fly great distances to volunteer for the best candidate every election\n\nWell I can at the moment. Can't speak for the future.\n\n&gt;Just because I'm not often given great choices to choose from doesn't make those electoral tools useless.\n\nIt's comments like these that make me wonder if you actually read the post... when I abstain from a given election I would hardly call that meaningless much less *useless*.\n\n&gt;So I apply those electoral tools within the limited opportunities available to me.\n\nAs you should.

Besides you're contradicting your point about the 'protest votes'.\n\n&gt;A stronger \"focus\" on election reform from the Democrats already in office isn't going to accomplish much at all.\n\nYou're right, what would really help is if they were sincere about wanting it.\n\n&gt;It just seems to me that what we need is more Democrats in power, so that they can either pass it unilaterally\n\nThey already had that opportunity and passed on it.

What makes you think it's hard to 'get' that anyway? It's no harder than for a position on some other issue (e.g. pro-choice/life). To say that what I'm doing isn't a viable or effective ignores the enormous influence already garnered by organizers who espouse the usage of this tactic (e.g. the NRA.)\n\nPoint of process: I have made an effort to respond to each of your points in every case, and offered to address any point you feel unsatisfied with in greater depth. On the other hand, one of my critical questions for you\n\n&gt;I would rather you answer my fundamental question to you: what is the line that a candidate must cross before you will refuse to vote for them under any circumstance?\n\ngoes unanswered despite my having repeated it at least twice. Please respond.\n\nEdit: \n\n&gt;That seems like something a politician would say if they're already fans of election reform.\n\nWhy is that worth commenting on? A great deal of what you've said thus far could easily have been said by a partisan congressional democrat but I don't see the pertinence of either comment. If your point is that something like Bush v Gore wasn't a wake up call to politicians who weren't cognizant of the major problems our election system has institutionalized then I don't really see where you're getting that from.", "id": "t1_cb7rc4v", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt; You're right, what would really help is if they were sincere about wanting it.\n\nHave you any reason for doubting their sincerity other than your complaint about the ~3 months in 2009 when you think they could have passed election reform?\n\n&gt;how is single-issue voting on election reform less legitimate than on other issues?\n\nI never said it was. They're all ineffective uses of the vote.\n\n&gt;what is the line that a candidate must cross before you will refuse to vote for them under any circumstance?\n\nI already answered that:\n\n&gt;That depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that. If polls were to say that only 10-20% of the population supports [crossing that line], and that the issue is very important, I could see how abstaining from voting and focusing on getting a new constitutional convention would make sense. But if polls were to say that 70-80% of the population supports [crossing that line], then abstaining from the vote isn't going to accomplish anything.\n\nSo no, there's no line that, if crossed, would lead me to think that abstaining from the vote would be a good decision. It depends on the degree to which that objectionable policy is accepted by the rest of the country. I already am shocked/outraged/disgusted by much of what the government does, but unless a lot of other people feel the same way, that doesn't make rejecting the entire voting process any more of a viable a way of changing the system.

I know it's an absurd question but I'm posing an extreme example to you only to emphasize the point about the shortcomings of approaching voting as realpolitik.\n\nProbably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted]. Pol Pot killed about 25% of his population in 4 years whereas Stalin killed only 10-20% of his population over 30 years. That's a big difference! But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\n&gt;we don't live in a society that separates their moral judgments from their voting judgements.\n\nI disagree. People are highly strategic in their voting judgments, and a very high percentage of voters do so despite feeling that they're choosing between the \"lesser of two evils\".\n\n&gt;Of course not (this is a straw man argument, I don't reject the process of voting, on the contrary I want to improve it!)\n\nI mean the voting process *in its current state*. By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\n&gt;My example was the NRA (an extremely effective organizing group that serves an influential bloc of single-issue voters.)\n\nNRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election. Their political clout comes primarily through a well-funded lobbying effort and their loyalty tests in the Republican primary.\n\n&gt;They've only pushed this issue when they knew their bill was a non-starter, how is that not a greenwash?\n\nBut it's almost *always* been a non-starter, and that's almost exclusively due to the inflexible positions taken by Republicans. The scarce few moments it's actually had a chance have had to be shared with several other vitally important issues that were just seeing a glimmer of the light of day. Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\". You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nThe obstruction of Republicans is *far* more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.", "id": "t1_cb7syi2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "johnpseudo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt; Probably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted].

But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\nBy taking this position you've essentially admitted that your position is non-viable (go try to convince Joe America that you're justified in your willingness to vote for either Stalin or Pol Pot.) I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality? Is it not entirely self-evident (from your POV) that voters care about these issues?\n\n&gt;By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\nI've explicitly disclaimed this notion in the CMV post, and in previous responses to you. How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

If you want a system where you can express preference rather than selection you need to go to instant runoff voting.\n\n&gt; I'm comfortable exercising my right to vote even in situations where I have no clear moral champion, because I understand that politics is never simple or clear.\n\nMe too. What I'm not comfortable doing is voting for somebody who is committed to an immoral course of action.\n\n&gt;Were you actually paying attention in 2009? They barely got anything passed. Mitch McConnell used every single opportunity to delay progress, calling for procedural delays that ate up days and weeks every time something needed to be passed through a committee or brought up for a vote or debated. Just as they were nearing the finish line, Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nYes I was paying attention in '09. Did you notice that Harry Reid had an opportunity to change the Senate rules on filibuster? The Democrats are only locked down in the Senate because they got their priorities mixed up. Harry Reid is *just now* looking at the 'nuclear' option in **2013** (and even then only for judicial appointments, the republicans WILL NOT stop at appointments and Reid knows that he's opening the door for a full blown nuclear option when/if they retake the Senate.) And now they're rolling back implementation even on what they DID get done. These people in the party establishment aren't serious about governing with liberal policies. \n\n&gt;Because that's the way the fucking useless Senate is designed- to allow a determined minority to delay everything practically forever.\n\nNot really. The Senate wasn't designed to require a 60 vote supermajority and you're well aware of that. They had time to pass landmark healthcare, they could have spent that time on filibuster reform and the past 5 years would have gone quite a bit differently (and they would have been able to pass healthcare anyway.) But as an institution they have no spine.\n\n&gt;And of course President Obama didn't have complete freedom to do whatever he wanted. \n\nI'm not saying that he did.\n\n&gt;I could easily imagine someone like Max Baucus or Joe Lieberman throwing up an objection which would have brought the whole thing to an end.\n\nThey spent more time on Bernie Sanders than on 'moderates' like Lieberman from the reportage I was seeing. That makes sense because Sanders is a socialist and as a party the democrats had long supported single-payer (because it actually makes sense in the context of the Democratic party's ideology and philosophical underpinnings) and he was horrified to see a deal that essentially created a new (and captive) market for private insurers. I think they hammered out a particular provision with Baucus but memory escapes me what it was.\n\n&gt;If even a single Democratic Senator was opposed, it wouldn't get through the Senate.\n\nWell who am I to hold accountable for that other than Harry Reid? If Democrats had championed filibuster reform *first* they could still have been *governing* today, but that isn't what they're interested in doing. They can't even police their own party: after gun control flopped at the beginning of this term the major donors pushed for culling the bluedogs from party funding and even THAT was no go. This is the gang who can't shoot straight.\n\n&gt;For all the horrible flaws Lieberman had, it was still useful to have him in office rather than a Republican (he did vote for Obamacare, the stimulus, and many other useful pieces of legislation after all).\n\nIrrelevant. He's an independent, and we're talking about Democrats. Besides, useful legislation? A lot of these guys pretend to be moderates but he himself (and quite a few Democrats) [was drinking the neoconservative kool aid.](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00236)\n\nI agree that voters should look at the affirmative arguments for a given candidate but shouldn't they also look at the negative? I don't think somebody like Reid is worth voting for if he's going to get up and pretend to represent the 'liberal' party and then use that position to reauthorize the neoconservative policies of the Bush administration, all the while crying crocodile tears about the republican obstructionism he chose to subject his party to.\n\n&gt;Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nWere *you* paying attention in 2009? Scott Brown '09 is a showpiece for my point about the role of money in politics. Anybody who was watching the money had a good sense that Brown was going to win that one.\n\nJust so the question is clear: how much is too much for you? If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for? I'm not comfortable saying 'my vote is for double-taps and soft money in government and an institution that can't enforce its will or even keep it's leadership on-message.' So no, the D's can earn my vote as individuals but I'm very skeptical about the institution of their party (likewise Republicans, the Tea Party, The Green Party). Aren't liberals such as yourself better served by supporting individual candidates and not the party?

What makes you think of the vote as an endorsement?\n\n&gt;If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for?\n\nThat depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that.

Your vote counts for one person and can *only be cast once, and only for one person, and only from one person per person per election*. You can only vote *affirmatively* and therefore may not express preference, whereas in instant runoff voting none of the above is true and one MAY express preference by listing their preferences in order. When write-in ballots are permitted I always participate on the basis of the above rationale and that scenario presenting an exception to the same. Isn't voting clearly a selection?

We're voting, it's decision time. Secret ballots, nobody finds out until afterward. As to the point about polling you're missing the point.

Doesn't it go against the fundamental American ethos to think of votes as tools which are reducible only to their strategic value?\n\n&gt;Because my tally mark is one that candidates actually pay attention to, it will have an impact on their behavior.\n\nThe candidates pay as much attention to me as anybody else I know. Keep in mind, on the basis of this point of view I'm telling every political operative and pollster that calls me that I'm an undecided.\n\n&gt;Since your tally mark is essentially ignored by candidates, it doesn't change their behavior.\n\nInvalid votes are the showpiece of the democratic pushback against voter ID laws. They were the centerpiece of liberal outrage following Bush v Gore. They're the substance of the pro-election reform argument, even for partisan democrats.\n\nEdit: Is the question I'm not addressing what is the substantive difference between an invalid ballot and non-participation?

Maybe if the votes didn't have equal *weighting* or something. But just because each vote is weighted the same doesn't mean each vote will have an equal substantive impact.\n\n&gt;Doesn't it go against the fundamental American ethos to think of votes as tools which are reducible only to their strategic value?\n\nI have no idea. Not any \"fundamental American ethos\" that I'm familiar with.\n\n&gt;The candidates pay as much attention to me as anybody else I know.\n\nYou may think this is the case, but I'm telling you that it really isn't. From a up-close and personal perspective in the campaigning process, candidates care very little about \"protest\" votes. From a purely practical perspective, they care much more about votes registered to one of the two major political parties. Protest votes just aren't a very reliable metric when trying to guess how much success any particular candidate or campaign platform is going to have. A well-funded candidate is going to start with the two-party results breakdown of past races, then if they have enough money they'll pay for some research about what the three most important issues are for voters in their district. If they've really got a lot of money they'll test verbiage for campaign platform planks addressing those issues.

Undecided voters, on average, tend to be people who are more responsive to advertising and persuasion from campaign volunteers. Someone who votes 'invalid' is likely to be very difficult to persuade or switch to a 'yes' vote.

Trust me, I actively avoid being marked as \"strong reject\". As for invalid ballots, I don't know who you listen to but I've heard democrats talk about election reform most when they make the observation that invalid votes are being cast (and that they know that most of those votes were intended for them.)

I would rather you answer my fundamental question to you: what is the line that a candidate must cross before you will refuse to vote for them under any circumstance? Do you even have one?\n\nBut we don't have to compare our experiences in politics for me to be skeptical of your point. If candidates don't care about invalid votes, why would they ever move on the issue of election reform anyway? Thats why I cited movetoamend.org: they have a realistic goal that doesn't involve passing a bill through the three houses, and has the potential to enact real election reform.\n\nEdit: sorry about the long delay and poor formating/spelling.

You've got the Democratic party, which actively pushes election reform any time there's a chance it would work. You started out by trying to use the DISCLOSE Act as an example of good legislation that Democrats refused to pass. The actual vote shows that it was actually all Democrats vs. all Republicans. It just seems to me that what we need is more Democrats in power, so that they can either pass it unilaterally or an extended period of political irrelevance will force Republicans to reform their party.

What makes you think it's hard to 'get' that anyway? It's no harder than for a position on some other issue (e.g. pro-choice/life). To say that what I'm doing isn't a viable or effective ignores the enormous influence already garnered by organizers who espouse the usage of this tactic (e.g. the NRA.)\n\nPoint of process: I have made an effort to respond to each of your points in every case, and offered to address any point you feel unsatisfied with in greater depth.

Please respond.\n\nEdit: \n\n&gt;That seems like something a politician would say if they're already fans of election reform.\n\nWhy is that worth commenting on? A great deal of what you've said thus far could easily have been said by a partisan congressional democrat but I don't see the pertinence of either comment.

I know it's an absurd question but I'm posing an extreme example to you only to emphasize the point about the shortcomings of approaching voting as realpolitik.\n\nProbably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted]. Pol Pot killed about 25% of his population in 4 years whereas Stalin killed only 10-20% of his population over 30 years. That's a big difference! But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\n&gt;we don't live in a society that separates their moral judgments from their voting judgements.\n\nI disagree. People are highly strategic in their voting judgments, and a very high percentage of voters do so despite feeling that they're choosing between the \"lesser of two evils\".\n\n&gt;Of course not (this is a straw man argument, I don't reject the process of voting, on the contrary I want to improve it!)\n\nI mean the voting process *in its current state*.

The scarce few moments it's actually had a chance have had to be shared with several other vitally important issues that were just seeing a glimmer of the light of day.

I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality?

How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

Did you notice that Harry Reid had an opportunity to change the Senate rules on filibuster? The Democrats are only locked down in the Senate because they got their priorities mixed up. Harry Reid is *just now* looking at the 'nuclear' option in **2013** (and even then only for judicial appointments, the republicans WILL NOT stop at appointments and Reid knows that he's opening the door for a full blown nuclear option when/if they retake the Senate.) And now they're rolling back implementation even on what they DID get done. These people in the party establishment aren't serious about governing with liberal policies. \n\n&gt;Because that's the way the fucking useless Senate is designed- to allow a determined minority to delay everything practically forever.\n\nNot really. The Senate wasn't designed to require a 60 vote supermajority and you're well aware of that. They had time to pass landmark healthcare, they could have spent that time on filibuster reform and the past 5 years would have gone quite a bit differently (and they would have been able to pass healthcare anyway.) But as an institution they have no spine.\n\n&gt;And of course President Obama didn't have complete freedom to do whatever he wanted. \n\nI'm not saying that he did.\n\n&gt;I could easily imagine someone like Max Baucus or Joe Lieberman throwing up an objection which would have brought the whole thing to an end.\n\nThey spent more time on Bernie Sanders than on 'moderates' like Lieberman from the reportage I was seeing. That makes sense because Sanders is a socialist and as a party the democrats had long supported single-payer (because it actually makes sense in the context of the Democratic party's ideology and philosophical underpinnings) and he was horrified to see a deal that essentially created a new (and captive) market for private insurers. I think they hammered out a particular provision with Baucus but memory escapes me what it was.\n\n&gt;If even a single Democratic Senator was opposed, it wouldn't get through the Senate.\n\nWell who am I to hold accountable for that other than Harry Reid? If Democrats had championed filibuster reform *first* they could still have been *governing* today, but that isn't what they're interested in doing. They can't even police their own party: after gun control flopped at the beginning of this term the major donors pushed for culling the bluedogs from party funding and even THAT was no go. This is the gang who can't shoot straight.\n\n&gt;For all the horrible flaws Lieberman had, it was still useful to have him in office rather than a Republican (he did vote for Obamacare, the stimulus, and many other useful pieces of legislation after all).\n\nIrrelevant. He's an independent, and we're talking about Democrats. Besides, useful legislation? A lot of these guys pretend to be moderates but he himself (and quite a few Democrats) [was drinking the neoconservative kool aid.](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00236)\n\nI agree that voters should look at the affirmative arguments for a given candidate but shouldn't they also look at the negative? I don't think somebody like Reid is worth voting for if he's going to get up and pretend to represent the 'liberal' party and then use that position to reauthorize the neoconservative policies of the Bush administration, all the while crying crocodile tears about the republican obstructionism he chose to subject his party to.\n\n&gt;Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nWere *you* paying attention in 2009? Scott Brown '09 is a showpiece for my point about the role of money in politics. Anybody who was watching the money had a good sense that Brown was going to win that one.\n\nJust so the question is clear: how much is too much for you? If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for? I'm not comfortable saying 'my vote is for double-taps and soft money in government and an institution that can't enforce its will or even keep it's leadership on-message.' So no, the D's can earn my vote as individuals but I'm very skeptical about the institution of their party (likewise Republicans, the Tea Party, The Green Party).

Your vote counts for one person and can *only be cast once, and only for one person, and only from one person per person per election*. You can only vote *affirmatively* and therefore may not express preference, whereas in instant runoff voting none of the above is true and one MAY express preference by listing their preferences in order. When write-in ballots are permitted I always participate on the basis of the above rationale and that scenario presenting an exception to the same. Isn't voting clearly a selection? As in 'this one gets my vote, I want her!'

We're voting, it's decision time. Secret ballots, nobody finds out until afterward. As to the point about polling you're missing the point. If voting is a meaningful expression of your political will at all then does it not affix some moral complicity to the voter when the government they put into office acts? If you're telling me that when you vote you do not make a moral affirmation of the candidate that has earned your vote then how do you enforce your will that your government should be a force for good?

I think both are equally obvious.)\n\n&gt;You can vote in whatever district you want?\n\nYou didn't say vote, you said move to.\n\n&gt;You don't think it's useless and I do.\n\nThat's because you're describing an entirely nihilistic view of voting. It has no moral consequence, it's just a piece of paper. That in itself is a pretty sad commentary on the state of affairs, I hope you can come out of being so jaded.\n\n&gt;I don't donate to the DNC or DCCC or DSCC\n\nWell then you don't actually support the Democratic Party and your position rests on air does it not? If you support the progressive caucus and you happen to live in a state where you have the opportunity to vote for their congressmen then we're probably in agreement about those people anyway. This happens to me with libertarians sometimes too, I think there's a communication breakdown (probably my fault.)\n\n&gt;What do you mean \"enforce my will\"? I can't enforce my will, I can only affect the outcome on the margin.\n\nThe point of voting in the first place is to effect (read: enforce) your will onto the political and governmental process. I would hate to feel so powerless and jaded as I would have to in order to willingly espouse the above quoted.

The votes of politicians in Congress are enormously important. What is the consequence of your not voting? Maybe you feel better about yourself. Maybe a few of your like-minded friends understand and appreciate what you did. But nobody else is going to get your \"message\".

If voting has moral consequence, then isn't a vote for Candidate X in part a statement that the voter condones the action of the candidate (especially in the case of incumbents because they have a record in government?)\n\n&gt;The simple truth is that you are only one of hundreds of millions of U.S. voters. So you aren't going to be able to \"enforce your will\" over the objections of everyone else.\n\nWe're back to what I would call a nihilistic view of voting here. Collectively we are intended to effect government by expressing our will through elections (voting.) The scale of that collective action isn't relevant, millions or billions or me and Joe and Tom and Susan. \n\n&gt;Everyone just has a marginal effect.\n\nYep. Will your small part be for crimes against humanity and soft money? I would be sorry to believe that my vote matters, but that I am so small that I myself do not matter. That I am only useful inasmuch as my faction is powerful.\n\n&gt;But we have a moral obligation to enact that small, marginal impact to the best of our abilities.\n\nYeah that's my point exactly. You have a moral duty to express your point of view through voting. I, for one, am not for condoning the actions of government when they commit crimes against humanity or when they subvert the processes of government or countermand their basis for legitimacy (the constitution.)\n\nEdit:\n\n&gt;No. That moral complicity is yours whether or not you vote, merely by virtue of the fact that you are a U.S. citizen.\n\nYou're telling me that if we elect Adolf Hitler that the people who vote for him are equally blameworthy (morally) as the people who vote against him?

If your point is that something like Bush v Gore wasn't a wake up call to politicians who weren't cognizant of the major problems our election system has institutionalized then I don't really see where you're getting that from.", "id": "t1_cb7rc4v", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt; You're right, what would really help is if they were sincere about wanting it.\n\nHave you any reason for doubting their sincerity other than your complaint about the ~3 months in 2009 when you think they could have passed election reform?\n\n&gt;how is single-issue voting on election reform less legitimate than on other issues?\n\nI never said it was. They're all ineffective uses of the vote.\n\n&gt;what is the line that a candidate must cross before you will refuse to vote for them under any circumstance?\n\nI already answered that:\n\n&gt;That depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that. If polls were to say that only 10-20% of the population supports [crossing that line], and that the issue is very important, I could see how abstaining from voting and focusing on getting a new constitutional convention would make sense. But if polls were to say that 70-80% of the population supports [crossing that line], then abstaining from the vote isn't going to accomplish anything.\n\nSo no, there's no line that, if crossed, would lead me to think that abstaining from the vote would be a good decision. It depends on the degree to which that objectionable policy is accepted by the rest of the country. I already am shocked/outraged/disgusted by much of what the government does, but unless a lot of other people feel the same way, that doesn't make rejecting the entire voting process any more of a viable a way of changing the system.

Please engage with the example and substantiate your point further so that I can respond.\n\n&gt;Have you any reason for doubting their sincerity other than your complaint about the ~3 months in 2009 when you think they could have passed election reform?\n\nI would have to go back to a completely different caucus and then we're just going to argue about the pertinence of the example... the last time Democrats controlled all three houses before that congress would have been before the midterms in Clinton's second term.

I know it's an absurd question but I'm posing an extreme example to you only to emphasize the point about the shortcomings of approaching voting as realpolitik.\n\nProbably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted]. Pol Pot killed about 25% of his population in 4 years whereas Stalin killed only 10-20% of his population over 30 years. That's a big difference! But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\n&gt;we don't live in a society that separates their moral judgments from their voting judgements.\n\nI disagree. People are highly strategic in their voting judgments, and a very high percentage of voters do so despite feeling that they're choosing between the \"lesser of two evils\".\n\n&gt;Of course not (this is a straw man argument, I don't reject the process of voting, on the contrary I want to improve it!)\n\nI mean the voting process *in its current state*. By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\n&gt;My example was the NRA (an extremely effective organizing group that serves an influential bloc of single-issue voters.)\n\nNRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election. Their political clout comes primarily through a well-funded lobbying effort and their loyalty tests in the Republican primary.\n\n&gt;They've only pushed this issue when they knew their bill was a non-starter, how is that not a greenwash?\n\nBut it's almost *always* been a non-starter, and that's almost exclusively due to the inflexible positions taken by Republicans. The scarce few moments it's actually had a chance have had to be shared with several other vitally important issues that were just seeing a glimmer of the light of day. Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\". You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nThe obstruction of Republicans is *far* more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.", "id": "t1_cb7syi2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "johnpseudo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt; Probably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted].

But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\nBy taking this position you've essentially admitted that your position is non-viable (go try to convince Joe America that you're justified in your willingness to vote for either Stalin or Pol Pot.) I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality? Is it not entirely self-evident (from your POV) that voters care about these issues?\n\n&gt;By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\nI've explicitly disclaimed this notion in the CMV post, and in previous responses to you. How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

I've already stipulated that republicans may be worse on this issue, but that doesn't justify voting democrat down the ballot.\n\nSet everything aside for a moment: there's already significant support for circumventing the need for a federal legislative solution and going to a constitutional convention (e.g. movetoamend.org).

Just as they were nearing the finish line, Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nYes I was paying attention in '09. Did you notice that Harry Reid had an opportunity to change the Senate rules on filibuster? The Democrats are only locked down in the Senate because they got their priorities mixed up. Harry Reid is *just now* looking at the 'nuclear' option in **2013** (and even then only for judicial appointments, the republicans WILL NOT stop at appointments and Reid knows that he's opening the door for a full blown nuclear option when/if they retake the Senate.) And now they're rolling back implementation even on what they DID get done. These people in the party establishment aren't serious about governing with liberal policies. \n\n&gt;Because that's the way the fucking useless Senate is designed- to allow a determined minority to delay everything practically forever.\n\nNot really. The Senate wasn't designed to require a 60 vote supermajority and you're well aware of that. They had time to pass landmark healthcare, they could have spent that time on filibuster reform and the past 5 years would have gone quite a bit differently (and they would have been able to pass healthcare anyway.) But as an institution they have no spine.\n\n&gt;And of course President Obama didn't have complete freedom to do whatever he wanted. \n\nI'm not saying that he did.\n\n&gt;I could easily imagine someone like Max Baucus or Joe Lieberman throwing up an objection which would have brought the whole thing to an end.\n\nThey spent more time on Bernie Sanders than on 'moderates' like Lieberman from the reportage I was seeing. That makes sense because Sanders is a socialist and as a party the democrats had long supported single-payer (because it actually makes sense in the context of the Democratic party's ideology and philosophical underpinnings) and he was horrified to see a deal that essentially created a new (and captive) market for private insurers. I think they hammered out a particular provision with Baucus but memory escapes me what it was.\n\n&gt;If even a single Democratic Senator was opposed, it wouldn't get through the Senate.\n\nWell who am I to hold accountable for that other than Harry Reid? If Democrats had championed filibuster reform *first* they could still have been *governing* today, but that isn't what they're interested in doing. They can't even police their own party: after gun control flopped at the beginning of this term the major donors pushed for culling the bluedogs from party funding and even THAT was no go. This is the gang who can't shoot straight.\n\n&gt;For all the horrible flaws Lieberman had, it was still useful to have him in office rather than a Republican (he did vote for Obamacare, the stimulus, and many other useful pieces of legislation after all).\n\nIrrelevant. He's an independent, and we're talking about Democrats. Besides, useful legislation? A lot of these guys pretend to be moderates but he himself (and quite a few Democrats) [was drinking the neoconservative kool aid.](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00236)\n\nI agree that voters should look at the affirmative arguments for a given candidate but shouldn't they also look at the negative? I don't think somebody like Reid is worth voting for if he's going to get up and pretend to represent the 'liberal' party and then use that position to reauthorize the neoconservative policies of the Bush administration, all the while crying crocodile tears about the republican obstructionism he chose to subject his party to.\n\n&gt;Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nWere *you* paying attention in 2009? Scott Brown '09 is a showpiece for my point about the role of money in politics. Anybody who was watching the money had a good sense that Brown was going to win that one.\n\nJust so the question is clear: how much is too much for you? If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for? I'm not comfortable saying 'my vote is for double-taps and soft money in government and an institution that can't enforce its will or even keep it's leadership on-message.' So no, the D's can earn my vote as individuals but I'm very skeptical about the institution of their party (likewise Republicans, the Tea Party, The Green Party).

What makes you think of the vote as an endorsement?\n\n&gt;If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for?\n\nThat depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that. If polls were to say that only 10-20% of the population supports shooting first responders, and that the issue is very important, I could see how abstaining from voting and focusing on getting a new constitutional convention would make sense.

Especially when the party as an organization isn't liberal at all?\n\nOf course I do focus on individual candidates. I would never donate money to or actively promote a conservative Democrat in another state. Because I have plenty of progressive Democrats around the country to choose from. But I can't choose which district I'm voting in, and I can't afford to fly great distances to volunteer for the best candidate every election.

Your vote counts for one person and can *only be cast once, and only for one person, and only from one person per person per election*. You can only vote *affirmatively* and therefore may not express preference, whereas in instant runoff voting none of the above is true and one MAY express preference by listing their preferences in order. When write-in ballots are permitted I always participate on the basis of the above rationale and that scenario presenting an exception to the same. Isn't voting clearly a selection?

We're voting, it's decision time. Secret ballots, nobody finds out until afterward. As to the point about polling you're missing the point.

Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

Even if they opposed election reform and voted against it after a filibuster, it would still pass.\n\n&gt;The point is that I'm seeing enough greenwash in the democratic party to merit some skepticism about their earnestness when it comes to federal elections reform\n\nPlease give me some clue what you're referring to *as it pertains to election reform*. I have no idea what you're talking about. The 2002 Campaign Finance Reform Act was passed [almost exclusively with Democratic votes](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=107&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00054). The DISCLOSE Act received [almost exclusively Democratic votes](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00240). Citizens United was ruled exclusively with judges nominated by Republican presidents. With more Democratic congressmen, it seems blatantly obvious that you'd be more likely to see campaign finance reform and voters rights reform.\n\n&gt;An obvious place to start when they were governing in three houses would have been to reform the CPD\n\nCPD? I'm unaware of the acronym. But please bear in mind that Democrats had a filibuster-proof majority for only ~3 months in 2009.

I keep asking: if they were serious about election reform why didn't they have any significant motion on it when they controlled all three houses? I've already stipulated that republicans may be worse on this issue, but that doesn't justify voting democrat down the ballot.\n\nSet everything aside for a moment: there's already significant support for circumventing the need for a federal legislative solution and going to a constitutional convention (e.g. movetoamend.org).

I could easily imagine someone like Max Baucus or Joe Lieberman throwing up an objection which would have brought the whole thing to an end. Bear in mind I'm not saying that I would have abstained from an election where it was Joe Lieberman vs. a Republican.

Mitch McConnell used every single opportunity to delay progress, calling for procedural delays that ate up days and weeks every time something needed to be passed through a committee or brought up for a vote or debated. Just as they were nearing the finish line, Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nYes I was paying attention in '09. Did you notice that Harry Reid had an opportunity to change the Senate rules on filibuster? The Democrats are only locked down in the Senate because they got their priorities mixed up. Harry Reid is *just now* looking at the 'nuclear' option in **2013** (and even then only for judicial appointments, the republicans WILL NOT stop at appointments and Reid knows that he's opening the door for a full blown nuclear option when/if they retake the Senate.) And now they're rolling back implementation even on what they DID get done. These people in the party establishment aren't serious about governing with liberal policies. \n\n&gt;Because that's the way the fucking useless Senate is designed- to allow a determined minority to delay everything practically forever.\n\nNot really. The Senate wasn't designed to require a 60 vote supermajority and you're well aware of that. They had time to pass landmark healthcare, they could have spent that time on filibuster reform and the past 5 years would have gone quite a bit differently (and they would have been able to pass healthcare anyway.) But as an institution they have no spine.\n\n&gt;And of course President Obama didn't have complete freedom to do whatever he wanted. \n\nI'm not saying that he did.\n\n&gt;I could easily imagine someone like Max Baucus or Joe Lieberman throwing up an objection which would have brought the whole thing to an end.\n\nThey spent more time on Bernie Sanders than on 'moderates' like Lieberman from the reportage I was seeing. That makes sense because Sanders is a socialist and as a party the democrats had long supported single-payer (because it actually makes sense in the context of the Democratic party's ideology and philosophical underpinnings) and he was horrified to see a deal that essentially created a new (and captive) market for private insurers. I think they hammered out a particular provision with Baucus but memory escapes me what it was.\n\n&gt;If even a single Democratic Senator was opposed, it wouldn't get through the Senate.\n\nWell who am I to hold accountable for that other than Harry Reid? If Democrats had championed filibuster reform *first* they could still have been *governing* today, but that isn't what they're interested in doing. They can't even police their own party: after gun control flopped at the beginning of this term the major donors pushed for culling the bluedogs from party funding and even THAT was no go. This is the gang who can't shoot straight.\n\n&gt;For all the horrible flaws Lieberman had, it was still useful to have him in office rather than a Republican (he did vote for Obamacare, the stimulus, and many other useful pieces of legislation after all).\n\nIrrelevant. He's an independent, and we're talking about Democrats. Besides, useful legislation? A lot of these guys pretend to be moderates but he himself (and quite a few Democrats) [was drinking the neoconservative kool aid.](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00236)\n\nI agree that voters should look at the affirmative arguments for a given candidate but shouldn't they also look at the negative? I don't think somebody like Reid is worth voting for if he's going to get up and pretend to represent the 'liberal' party and then use that position to reauthorize the neoconservative policies of the Bush administration, all the while crying crocodile tears about the republican obstructionism he chose to subject his party to.\n\n&gt;Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nWere *you* paying attention in 2009? Scott Brown '09 is a showpiece for my point about the role of money in politics. Anybody who was watching the money had a good sense that Brown was going to win that one.\n\nJust so the question is clear: how much is too much for you? If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for? I'm not comfortable saying 'my vote is for double-taps and soft money in government and an institution that can't enforce its will or even keep it's leadership on-message.' So no, the D's can earn my vote as individuals but I'm very skeptical about the institution of their party (likewise Republicans, the Tea Party, The Green Party). Aren't liberals such as yourself better served by supporting individual candidates and not the party?

You think a vote is an endorsement, and I see it as simply a way to affect the outcome. Why can't you vote for someone while still acknowledging their problems? What makes you think of the vote as an endorsement?\n\n&gt;If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for?\n\nThat depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that. If polls were to say that only 10-20% of the population supports shooting first responders, and that the issue is very important, I could see how abstaining from voting and focusing on getting a new constitutional convention would make sense. But if polls were to say that 70-80% of the population supports shooting first responders, then abstaining from the vote isn't going to accomplish anything.\n\n&gt;Aren't liberals such as yourself better served by supporting individual candidates and not the party? Especially when the party as an organization isn't liberal at all?\n\nOf course I do focus on individual candidates. I would never donate money to or actively promote a conservative Democrat in another state. Because I have plenty of progressive Democrats around the country to choose from. But I can't choose which district I'm voting in, and I can't afford to fly great distances to volunteer for the best candidate every election.

Your vote counts for one person and can *only be cast once, and only for one person, and only from one person per person per election*. You can only vote *affirmatively* and therefore may not express preference, whereas in instant runoff voting none of the above is true and one MAY express preference by listing their preferences in order. When write-in ballots are permitted I always participate on the basis of the above rationale and that scenario presenting an exception to the same. Isn't voting clearly a selection? As in 'this one gets my vote, I want her!' In order to express the political will consistent with the expression 'I want this one but if I can't have it that way I'll take Nixon instead and then if they both lose I'll take Pol Pot' in the form of a ballot one would necessarily require a runoff style ballot would they not?\n\n&gt;That depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that.\n\nWhat the hell does that mean? We're voting, it's decision time. Secret ballots, nobody finds out until afterward. As to the point about polling you're missing the point. If voting is a meaningful expression of your political will at all then does it not affix some moral complicity to the voter when the government they put into office acts? If you're telling me that when you vote you do not make a moral affirmation of the candidate that has earned your vote then how do you enforce your will that your government should be a force for good? (I don't vote for candidates that I believe will engage in crimes against humanity such as double-taps. This is an extremely low bar.) We don't make moral judgments as a group we make them as individuals.\n\n&gt;I would never donate money to or actively promote a conservative Democrat in another state.\n\nLike I said, D triple C money is still flowing freely to these people.

I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

If the last Democrat won 40-45%, and you feel well-positioned, you might take a shot at it even if the district has an incumbent.

Realpolitik doesn't deliver on issues it delivers on demands, so if the demand is election reform or whatever else then one can be secure in the decision to only vote for a candidate that espouses that view.

Whereas every single Republican Senator voted to filibuster it. So I'm failing to see how the distinctions between individual Democrats in Congress is relevant at all. Republicans are going to filibuster election reform and Democrats aren't. Even if they opposed election reform and voted against it after a filibuster, it would still pass.\n\n&gt;The point is that I'm seeing enough greenwash in the democratic party to merit some skepticism about their earnestness when it comes to federal elections reform\n\nPlease give me some clue what you're referring to *as it pertains to election reform*. I have no idea what you're talking about. The 2002 Campaign Finance Reform Act was passed [almost exclusively with Democratic votes](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=107&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00054). The DISCLOSE Act received [almost exclusively Democratic votes](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00240). Citizens United was ruled exclusively with judges nominated by Republican presidents. With more Democratic congressmen, it seems blatantly obvious that you'd be more likely to see campaign finance reform and voters rights reform.\n\n&gt;An obvious place to start when they were governing in three houses would have been to reform the CPD\n\nCPD? I'm unaware of the acronym. But please bear in mind that Democrats had a filibuster-proof majority for only ~3 months in 2009.

I keep asking: if they were serious about election reform why didn't they have any significant motion on it when they controlled all three houses? I've already stipulated that republicans may be worse on this issue, but that doesn't justify voting democrat down the ballot.\n\nSet everything aside for a moment: there's already significant support for circumventing the need for a federal legislative solution and going to a constitutional convention (e.g. movetoamend.org).

If even a single Democratic Senator was opposed, it wouldn't get through the Senate. I could easily imagine someone like Max Baucus or Joe Lieberman throwing up an objection which would have brought the whole thing to an end. Bear in mind I'm not saying that I would have abstained from an election where it was Joe Lieberman vs. a Republican.

Mitch McConnell used every single opportunity to delay progress, calling for procedural delays that ate up days and weeks every time something needed to be passed through a committee or brought up for a vote or debated. Just as they were nearing the finish line, Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nYes I was paying attention in '09. Did you notice that Harry Reid had an opportunity to change the Senate rules on filibuster? The Democrats are only locked down in the Senate because they got their priorities mixed up. Harry Reid is *just now* looking at the 'nuclear' option in **2013** (and even then only for judicial appointments, the republicans WILL NOT stop at appointments and Reid knows that he's opening the door for a full blown nuclear option when/if they retake the Senate.) And now they're rolling back implementation even on what they DID get done. These people in the party establishment aren't serious about governing with liberal policies. \n\n&gt;Because that's the way the fucking useless Senate is designed- to allow a determined minority to delay everything practically forever.\n\nNot really. The Senate wasn't designed to require a 60 vote supermajority and you're well aware of that. They had time to pass landmark healthcare, they could have spent that time on filibuster reform and the past 5 years would have gone quite a bit differently (and they would have been able to pass healthcare anyway.) But as an institution they have no spine.\n\n&gt;And of course President Obama didn't have complete freedom to do whatever he wanted. \n\nI'm not saying that he did.\n\n&gt;I could easily imagine someone like Max Baucus or Joe Lieberman throwing up an objection which would have brought the whole thing to an end.\n\nThey spent more time on Bernie Sanders than on 'moderates' like Lieberman from the reportage I was seeing. That makes sense because Sanders is a socialist and as a party the democrats had long supported single-payer (because it actually makes sense in the context of the Democratic party's ideology and philosophical underpinnings) and he was horrified to see a deal that essentially created a new (and captive) market for private insurers. I think they hammered out a particular provision with Baucus but memory escapes me what it was.\n\n&gt;If even a single Democratic Senator was opposed, it wouldn't get through the Senate.\n\nWell who am I to hold accountable for that other than Harry Reid? If Democrats had championed filibuster reform *first* they could still have been *governing* today, but that isn't what they're interested in doing. They can't even police their own party: after gun control flopped at the beginning of this term the major donors pushed for culling the bluedogs from party funding and even THAT was no go. This is the gang who can't shoot straight.\n\n&gt;For all the horrible flaws Lieberman had, it was still useful to have him in office rather than a Republican (he did vote for Obamacare, the stimulus, and many other useful pieces of legislation after all).\n\nIrrelevant. He's an independent, and we're talking about Democrats. Besides, useful legislation? A lot of these guys pretend to be moderates but he himself (and quite a few Democrats) [was drinking the neoconservative kool aid.](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00236)\n\nI agree that voters should look at the affirmative arguments for a given candidate but shouldn't they also look at the negative? I don't think somebody like Reid is worth voting for if he's going to get up and pretend to represent the 'liberal' party and then use that position to reauthorize the neoconservative policies of the Bush administration, all the while crying crocodile tears about the republican obstructionism he chose to subject his party to.\n\n&gt;Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nWere *you* paying attention in 2009? Scott Brown '09 is a showpiece for my point about the role of money in politics. Anybody who was watching the money had a good sense that Brown was going to win that one.\n\nJust so the question is clear: how much is too much for you? If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for? I'm not comfortable saying 'my vote is for double-taps and soft money in government and an institution that can't enforce its will or even keep it's leadership on-message.' So no, the D's can earn my vote as individuals but I'm very skeptical about the institution of their party (likewise Republicans, the Tea Party, The Green Party). Aren't liberals such as yourself better served by supporting individual candidates and not the party?

You think a vote is an endorsement, and I see it as simply a way to affect the outcome. Why can't you vote for someone while still acknowledging their problems? What makes you think of the vote as an endorsement?\n\n&gt;If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for?\n\nThat depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that. If polls were to say that only 10-20% of the population supports shooting first responders, and that the issue is very important, I could see how abstaining from voting and focusing on getting a new constitutional convention would make sense. But if polls were to say that 70-80% of the population supports shooting first responders, then abstaining from the vote isn't going to accomplish anything.\n\n&gt;Aren't liberals such as yourself better served by supporting individual candidates and not the party? Especially when the party as an organization isn't liberal at all?\n\nOf course I do focus on individual candidates. I would never donate money to or actively promote a conservative Democrat in another state. Because I have plenty of progressive Democrats around the country to choose from. But I can't choose which district I'm voting in, and I can't afford to fly great distances to volunteer for the best candidate every election.

Your vote counts for one person and can *only be cast once, and only for one person, and only from one person per person per election*. You can only vote *affirmatively* and therefore may not express preference, whereas in instant runoff voting none of the above is true and one MAY express preference by listing their preferences in order. When write-in ballots are permitted I always participate on the basis of the above rationale and that scenario presenting an exception to the same. Isn't voting clearly a selection? As in 'this one gets my vote, I want her!' In order to express the political will consistent with the expression 'I want this one but if I can't have it that way I'll take Nixon instead and then if they both lose I'll take Pol Pot' in the form of a ballot one would necessarily require a runoff style ballot would they not?\n\n&gt;That depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that.\n\nWhat the hell does that mean? We're voting, it's decision time. Secret ballots, nobody finds out until afterward. As to the point about polling you're missing the point. If voting is a meaningful expression of your political will at all then does it not affix some moral complicity to the voter when the government they put into office acts? If you're telling me that when you vote you do not make a moral affirmation of the candidate that has earned your vote then how do you enforce your will that your government should be a force for good? (I don't vote for candidates that I believe will engage in crimes against humanity such as double-taps. This is an extremely low bar.) We don't make moral judgments as a group we make them as individuals.\n\n&gt;I would never donate money to or actively promote a conservative Democrat in another state.\n\nLike I said, D triple C money is still flowing freely to these people.

I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

Did you notice that Harry Reid had an opportunity to change the Senate rules on filibuster? The Democrats are only locked down in the Senate because they got their priorities mixed up. Harry Reid is *just now* looking at the 'nuclear' option in **2013** (and even then only for judicial appointments, the republicans WILL NOT stop at appointments and Reid knows that he's opening the door for a full blown nuclear option when/if they retake the Senate.) And now they're rolling back implementation even on what they DID get done. These people in the party establishment aren't serious about governing with liberal policies. \n\n&gt;Because that's the way the fucking useless Senate is designed- to allow a determined minority to delay everything practically forever.\n\nNot really. The Senate wasn't designed to require a 60 vote supermajority and you're well aware of that. They had time to pass landmark healthcare, they could have spent that time on filibuster reform and the past 5 years would have gone quite a bit differently (and they would have been able to pass healthcare anyway.) But as an institution they have no spine.\n\n&gt;And of course President Obama didn't have complete freedom to do whatever he wanted. \n\nI'm not saying that he did.\n\n&gt;I could easily imagine someone like Max Baucus or Joe Lieberman throwing up an objection which would have brought the whole thing to an end.\n\nThey spent more time on Bernie Sanders than on 'moderates' like Lieberman from the reportage I was seeing. That makes sense because Sanders is a socialist and as a party the democrats had long supported single-payer (because it actually makes sense in the context of the Democratic party's ideology and philosophical underpinnings) and he was horrified to see a deal that essentially created a new (and captive) market for private insurers. I think they hammered out a particular provision with Baucus but memory escapes me what it was.\n\n&gt;If even a single Democratic Senator was opposed, it wouldn't get through the Senate.\n\nWell who am I to hold accountable for that other than Harry Reid? If Democrats had championed filibuster reform *first* they could still have been *governing* today, but that isn't what they're interested in doing. They can't even police their own party: after gun control flopped at the beginning of this term the major donors pushed for culling the bluedogs from party funding and even THAT was no go. This is the gang who can't shoot straight.\n\n&gt;For all the horrible flaws Lieberman had, it was still useful to have him in office rather than a Republican (he did vote for Obamacare, the stimulus, and many other useful pieces of legislation after all).\n\nIrrelevant. He's an independent, and we're talking about Democrats. Besides, useful legislation? A lot of these guys pretend to be moderates but he himself (and quite a few Democrats) [was drinking the neoconservative kool aid.](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00236)\n\nI agree that voters should look at the affirmative arguments for a given candidate but shouldn't they also look at the negative? I don't think somebody like Reid is worth voting for if he's going to get up and pretend to represent the 'liberal' party and then use that position to reauthorize the neoconservative policies of the Bush administration, all the while crying crocodile tears about the republican obstructionism he chose to subject his party to.\n\n&gt;Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nWere *you* paying attention in 2009? Scott Brown '09 is a showpiece for my point about the role of money in politics. Anybody who was watching the money had a good sense that Brown was going to win that one.\n\nJust so the question is clear: how much is too much for you? If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for? I'm not comfortable saying 'my vote is for double-taps and soft money in government and an institution that can't enforce its will or even keep it's leadership on-message.' So no, the D's can earn my vote as individuals but I'm very skeptical about the institution of their party (likewise Republicans, the Tea Party, The Green Party).

But if polls were to say that 70-80% of the population supports shooting first responders, then abstaining from the vote isn't going to accomplish anything.\n\n&gt;Aren't liberals such as yourself better served by supporting individual candidates and not the party? Especially when the party as an organization isn't liberal at all?\n\nOf course I do focus on individual candidates. I would never donate money to or actively promote a conservative Democrat in another state. Because I have plenty of progressive Democrats around the country to choose from. But I can't choose which district I'm voting in, and I can't afford to fly great distances to volunteer for the best candidate every election.

Your vote counts for one person and can *only be cast once, and only for one person, and only from one person per person per election*. You can only vote *affirmatively* and therefore may not express preference, whereas in instant runoff voting none of the above is true and one MAY express preference by listing their preferences in order. When write-in ballots are permitted I always participate on the basis of the above rationale and that scenario presenting an exception to the same. Isn't voting clearly a selection?

We're voting, it's decision time. Secret ballots, nobody finds out until afterward. As to the point about polling you're missing the point.

I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

The Democratic party is not your enemy here.\n\nAnd in the subsequent years? The Democratic party is clearly disinterested in anything beyond superficial attempts as federal election reform. That his bill makes it into the legislative agenda only when the democrats don't have a supermajority (and the incentive structure) is very telling.\n\nRepublicans aren't doing the issue any favors either, but the notion that one ought to legitimize the unacceptable behavior of one group because they oppose a slightly more scary monster doesn't make much sense to me. What is accomplished?\n\n&gt;Those seats are only \"safe\" insofar as past demographics and voting patterns continue to be a good predictor of future election results. If people like you decide to vote, it would alter the percentage of likely voters, making districts less safe for incumbents.\n\nThat would be true if there weren't significant barriers to entry monetarily or if the problem with gerrymandering was about incumbency. The problem with gerrymandering is that it disenfranchises voters (and thereby undermines the legitimacy of the government.) Even so, what is meant by 'people like me'? People who don't vote in federal elections?

Did you notice that Harry Reid had an opportunity to change the Senate rules on filibuster? The Democrats are only locked down in the Senate because they got their priorities mixed up. Harry Reid is *just now* looking at the 'nuclear' option in **2013** (and even then only for judicial appointments, the republicans WILL NOT stop at appointments and Reid knows that he's opening the door for a full blown nuclear option when/if they retake the Senate.) And now they're rolling back implementation even on what they DID get done. These people in the party establishment aren't serious about governing with liberal policies. \n\n&gt;Because that's the way the fucking useless Senate is designed- to allow a determined minority to delay everything practically forever.\n\nNot really. The Senate wasn't designed to require a 60 vote supermajority and you're well aware of that. They had time to pass landmark healthcare, they could have spent that time on filibuster reform and the past 5 years would have gone quite a bit differently (and they would have been able to pass healthcare anyway.) But as an institution they have no spine.\n\n&gt;And of course President Obama didn't have complete freedom to do whatever he wanted. \n\nI'm not saying that he did.\n\n&gt;I could easily imagine someone like Max Baucus or Joe Lieberman throwing up an objection which would have brought the whole thing to an end.\n\nThey spent more time on Bernie Sanders than on 'moderates' like Lieberman from the reportage I was seeing. That makes sense because Sanders is a socialist and as a party the democrats had long supported single-payer (because it actually makes sense in the context of the Democratic party's ideology and philosophical underpinnings) and he was horrified to see a deal that essentially created a new (and captive) market for private insurers. I think they hammered out a particular provision with Baucus but memory escapes me what it was.\n\n&gt;If even a single Democratic Senator was opposed, it wouldn't get through the Senate.\n\nWell who am I to hold accountable for that other than Harry Reid? If Democrats had championed filibuster reform *first* they could still have been *governing* today, but that isn't what they're interested in doing. They can't even police their own party: after gun control flopped at the beginning of this term the major donors pushed for culling the bluedogs from party funding and even THAT was no go. This is the gang who can't shoot straight.\n\n&gt;For all the horrible flaws Lieberman had, it was still useful to have him in office rather than a Republican (he did vote for Obamacare, the stimulus, and many other useful pieces of legislation after all).\n\nIrrelevant. He's an independent, and we're talking about Democrats. Besides, useful legislation? A lot of these guys pretend to be moderates but he himself (and quite a few Democrats) [was drinking the neoconservative kool aid.](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00236)\n\nI agree that voters should look at the affirmative arguments for a given candidate but shouldn't they also look at the negative? I don't think somebody like Reid is worth voting for if he's going to get up and pretend to represent the 'liberal' party and then use that position to reauthorize the neoconservative policies of the Bush administration, all the while crying crocodile tears about the republican obstructionism he chose to subject his party to.\n\n&gt;Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nWere *you* paying attention in 2009? Scott Brown '09 is a showpiece for my point about the role of money in politics. Anybody who was watching the money had a good sense that Brown was going to win that one.\n\nJust so the question is clear: how much is too much for you? If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for? I'm not comfortable saying 'my vote is for double-taps and soft money in government and an institution that can't enforce its will or even keep it's leadership on-message.' So no, the D's can earn my vote as individuals but I'm very skeptical about the institution of their party (likewise Republicans, the Tea Party, The Green Party).

Your vote counts for one person and can *only be cast once, and only for one person, and only from one person per person per election*. You can only vote *affirmatively* and therefore may not express preference, whereas in instant runoff voting none of the above is true and one MAY express preference by listing their preferences in order.

I think both are equally obvious.)\n\n&gt;You can vote in whatever district you want?\n\nYou didn't say vote, you said move to.\n\n&gt;You don't think it's useless and I do.\n\nThat's because you're describing an entirely nihilistic view of voting. It has no moral consequence, it's just a piece of paper. That in itself is a pretty sad commentary on the state of affairs, I hope you can come out of being so jaded.\n\n&gt;I don't donate to the DNC or DCCC or DSCC\n\nWell then you don't actually support the Democratic Party and your position rests on air does it not? If you support the progressive caucus and you happen to live in a state where you have the opportunity to vote for their congressmen then we're probably in agreement about those people anyway. This happens to me with libertarians sometimes too, I think there's a communication breakdown (probably my fault.)\n\n&gt;What do you mean \"enforce my will\"? I can't enforce my will, I can only affect the outcome on the margin.\n\nThe point of voting in the first place is to effect (read: enforce) your will onto the political and governmental process. I would hate to feel so powerless and jaded as I would have to in order to willingly espouse the above quoted.

The votes of politicians in Congress are enormously important. What is the consequence of your not voting? Maybe you feel better about yourself. Maybe a few of your like-minded friends understand and appreciate what you did. But nobody else is going to get your \"message\".

If voting has moral consequence, then isn't a vote for Candidate X in part a statement that the voter condones the action of the candidate (especially in the case of incumbents because they have a record in government?)\n\n&gt;The simple truth is that you are only one of hundreds of millions of U.S. voters. So you aren't going to be able to \"enforce your will\" over the objections of everyone else.\n\nWe're back to what I would call a nihilistic view of voting here. Collectively we are intended to effect government by expressing our will through elections (voting.) The scale of that collective action isn't relevant, millions or billions or me and Joe and Tom and Susan. \n\n&gt;Everyone just has a marginal effect.\n\nYep. Will your small part be for crimes against humanity and soft money? I would be sorry to believe that my vote matters, but that I am so small that I myself do not matter. That I am only useful inasmuch as my faction is powerful.\n\n&gt;But we have a moral obligation to enact that small, marginal impact to the best of our abilities.\n\nYeah that's my point exactly. You have a moral duty to express your point of view through voting. I, for one, am not for condoning the actions of government when they commit crimes against humanity or when they subvert the processes of government or countermand their basis for legitimacy (the constitution.)\n\nEdit:\n\n&gt;No. That moral complicity is yours whether or not you vote, merely by virtue of the fact that you are a U.S. citizen.\n\nYou're telling me that if we elect Adolf Hitler that the people who vote for him are equally blameworthy (morally) as the people who vote against him?

If your point is that something like Bush v Gore wasn't a wake up call to politicians who weren't cognizant of the major problems our election system has institutionalized then I don't really see where you're getting that from.", "id": "t1_cb7rc4v", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt; You're right, what would really help is if they were sincere about wanting it.\n\nHave you any reason for doubting their sincerity other than your complaint about the ~3 months in 2009 when you think they could have passed election reform?\n\n&gt;how is single-issue voting on election reform less legitimate than on other issues?\n\nI never said it was. They're all ineffective uses of the vote.\n\n&gt;what is the line that a candidate must cross before you will refuse to vote for them under any circumstance?\n\nI already answered that:\n\n&gt;That depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that. If polls were to say that only 10-20% of the population supports [crossing that line], and that the issue is very important, I could see how abstaining from voting and focusing on getting a new constitutional convention would make sense. But if polls were to say that 70-80% of the population supports [crossing that line], then abstaining from the vote isn't going to accomplish anything.\n\nSo no, there's no line that, if crossed, would lead me to think that abstaining from the vote would be a good decision. It depends on the degree to which that objectionable policy is accepted by the rest of the country. I already am shocked/outraged/disgusted by much of what the government does, but unless a lot of other people feel the same way, that doesn't make rejecting the entire voting process any more of a viable a way of changing the system.

Please engage with the example and substantiate your point further so that I can respond.\n\n&gt;Have you any reason for doubting their sincerity other than your complaint about the ~3 months in 2009 when you think they could have passed election reform?\n\nI would have to go back to a completely different caucus and then we're just going to argue about the pertinence of the example... the last time Democrats controlled all three houses before that congress would have been before the midterms in Clinton's second term.

I know it's an absurd question but I'm posing an extreme example to you only to emphasize the point about the shortcomings of approaching voting as realpolitik.\n\nProbably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted]. Pol Pot killed about 25% of his population in 4 years whereas Stalin killed only 10-20% of his population over 30 years. That's a big difference! But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\n&gt;we don't live in a society that separates their moral judgments from their voting judgements.\n\nI disagree. People are highly strategic in their voting judgments, and a very high percentage of voters do so despite feeling that they're choosing between the \"lesser of two evils\".\n\n&gt;Of course not (this is a straw man argument, I don't reject the process of voting, on the contrary I want to improve it!)\n\nI mean the voting process *in its current state*. By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\n&gt;My example was the NRA (an extremely effective organizing group that serves an influential bloc of single-issue voters.)\n\nNRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election. Their political clout comes primarily through a well-funded lobbying effort and their loyalty tests in the Republican primary.\n\n&gt;They've only pushed this issue when they knew their bill was a non-starter, how is that not a greenwash?\n\nBut it's almost *always* been a non-starter, and that's almost exclusively due to the inflexible positions taken by Republicans. The scarce few moments it's actually had a chance have had to be shared with several other vitally important issues that were just seeing a glimmer of the light of day. Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\". You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nThe obstruction of Republicans is *far* more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.", "id": "t1_cb7syi2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "johnpseudo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt; Probably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted].

But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\nBy taking this position you've essentially admitted that your position is non-viable (go try to convince Joe America that you're justified in your willingness to vote for either Stalin or Pol Pot.) I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality? Is it not entirely self-evident (from your POV) that voters care about these issues?\n\n&gt;By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\nI've explicitly disclaimed this notion in the CMV post, and in previous responses to you. How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

Did you notice that Harry Reid had an opportunity to change the Senate rules on filibuster? The Democrats are only locked down in the Senate because they got their priorities mixed up. Harry Reid is *just now* looking at the 'nuclear' option in **2013** (and even then only for judicial appointments, the republicans WILL NOT stop at appointments and Reid knows that he's opening the door for a full blown nuclear option when/if they retake the Senate.) And now they're rolling back implementation even on what they DID get done. These people in the party establishment aren't serious about governing with liberal policies. \n\n&gt;Because that's the way the fucking useless Senate is designed- to allow a determined minority to delay everything practically forever.\n\nNot really. The Senate wasn't designed to require a 60 vote supermajority and you're well aware of that. They had time to pass landmark healthcare, they could have spent that time on filibuster reform and the past 5 years would have gone quite a bit differently (and they would have been able to pass healthcare anyway.) But as an institution they have no spine.\n\n&gt;And of course President Obama didn't have complete freedom to do whatever he wanted. \n\nI'm not saying that he did.\n\n&gt;I could easily imagine someone like Max Baucus or Joe Lieberman throwing up an objection which would have brought the whole thing to an end.\n\nThey spent more time on Bernie Sanders than on 'moderates' like Lieberman from the reportage I was seeing. That makes sense because Sanders is a socialist and as a party the democrats had long supported single-payer (because it actually makes sense in the context of the Democratic party's ideology and philosophical underpinnings) and he was horrified to see a deal that essentially created a new (and captive) market for private insurers. I think they hammered out a particular provision with Baucus but memory escapes me what it was.\n\n&gt;If even a single Democratic Senator was opposed, it wouldn't get through the Senate.\n\nWell who am I to hold accountable for that other than Harry Reid? If Democrats had championed filibuster reform *first* they could still have been *governing* today, but that isn't what they're interested in doing. They can't even police their own party: after gun control flopped at the beginning of this term the major donors pushed for culling the bluedogs from party funding and even THAT was no go. This is the gang who can't shoot straight.\n\n&gt;For all the horrible flaws Lieberman had, it was still useful to have him in office rather than a Republican (he did vote for Obamacare, the stimulus, and many other useful pieces of legislation after all).\n\nIrrelevant. He's an independent, and we're talking about Democrats. Besides, useful legislation? A lot of these guys pretend to be moderates but he himself (and quite a few Democrats) [was drinking the neoconservative kool aid.](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00236)\n\nI agree that voters should look at the affirmative arguments for a given candidate but shouldn't they also look at the negative? I don't think somebody like Reid is worth voting for if he's going to get up and pretend to represent the 'liberal' party and then use that position to reauthorize the neoconservative policies of the Bush administration, all the while crying crocodile tears about the republican obstructionism he chose to subject his party to.\n\n&gt;Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nWere *you* paying attention in 2009? Scott Brown '09 is a showpiece for my point about the role of money in politics. Anybody who was watching the money had a good sense that Brown was going to win that one.\n\nJust so the question is clear: how much is too much for you? If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for? I'm not comfortable saying 'my vote is for double-taps and soft money in government and an institution that can't enforce its will or even keep it's leadership on-message.' So no, the D's can earn my vote as individuals but I'm very skeptical about the institution of their party (likewise Republicans, the Tea Party, The Green Party). Aren't liberals such as yourself better served by supporting individual candidates and not the party? Especially when the party as an organization isn't liberal at all?\n\nEdit: Spelling, formatting, grammar", "id": "t1_cb5xmin", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; It is an endorsement, that's the system of voting that we have.

What makes you think of the vote as an endorsement?\n\n&gt;If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for?\n\nThat depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that. If polls were to say that only 10-20% of the population supports shooting first responders, and that the issue is very important, I could see how abstaining from voting and focusing on getting a new constitutional convention would make sense. But if polls were to say that 70-80% of the population supports shooting first responders, then abstaining from the vote isn't going to accomplish anything.\n\n&gt;Aren't liberals such as yourself better served by supporting individual candidates and not the party?

I would never donate money to or actively promote a conservative Democrat in another state. Because I have plenty of progressive Democrats around the country to choose from. But I can't choose which district I'm voting in, and I can't afford to fly great distances to volunteer for the best candidate every election.

Your vote counts for one person and can *only be cast once, and only for one person, and only from one person per person per election*. You can only vote *affirmatively* and therefore may not express preference, whereas in instant runoff voting none of the above is true and one MAY express preference by listing their preferences in order. When write-in ballots are permitted I always participate on the basis of the above rationale and that scenario presenting an exception to the same. Isn't voting clearly a selection? As in 'this one gets my vote, I want her!' In order to express the political will consistent with the expression 'I want this one but if I can't have it that way I'll take Nixon instead and then if they both lose I'll take Pol Pot' in the form of a ballot one would necessarily require a runoff style ballot would they not?\n\n&gt;That depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that.\n\nWhat the hell does that mean? We're voting, it's decision time. Secret ballots, nobody finds out until afterward. As to the point about polling you're missing the point. If voting is a meaningful expression of your political will at all then does it not affix some moral complicity to the voter when the government they put into office acts? If you're telling me that when you vote you do not make a moral affirmation of the candidate that has earned your vote then how do you enforce your will that your government should be a force for good?

Protest votes just aren't a very reliable metric when trying to guess how much success any particular candidate or campaign platform is going to have. A well-funded candidate is going to start with the two-party results breakdown of past races, then if they have enough money they'll pay for some research about what the three most important issues are for voters in their district. If they've really got a lot of money they'll test verbiage for campaign platform planks addressing those issues. At no point are the number of protest votes going to enter the calculation.\n\n&gt;Invalid votes are the showpiece of the democratic pushback against voter ID laws. They were the centerpiece of liberal outrage following Bush v Gore. They're the substance of the pro-election reform argument, even for partisan democrats.\n\nWhether or not they were the centerpiece of a strategy trying to affect pro-election reform, they're an ineffective strategy.", "id": "t1_cb63u6g", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "johnpseudo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;Not any \"fundamental American ethos\" that I'm familiar with.\n\nHave you tried going around telling voters that their votes are only as meaningful as their strategic value to candidates?

Someone who votes 'invalid' is likely to be very difficult to persuade or switch to a 'yes' vote.

As for invalid ballots, I don't know who you listen to but I've heard democrats talk about election reform most when they make the observation that invalid votes are being cast (and that they know that most of those votes were intended for them.)

Do you even have one?\n\nBut we don't have to compare our experiences in politics for me to be skeptical of your point. If candidates don't care about invalid votes, why would they ever move on the issue of election reform anyway?

I know it's an absurd question but I'm posing an extreme example to you only to emphasize the point about the shortcomings of approaching voting as realpolitik.\n\nProbably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted]. Pol Pot killed about 25% of his population in 4 years whereas Stalin killed only 10-20% of his population over 30 years. That's a big difference! But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\n&gt;we don't live in a society that separates their moral judgments from their voting judgements.\n\nI disagree. People are highly strategic in their voting judgments, and a very high percentage of voters do so despite feeling that they're choosing between the \"lesser of two evils\".\n\n&gt;Of course not (this is a straw man argument, I don't reject the process of voting, on the contrary I want to improve it!)\n\nI mean the voting process *in its current state*.

I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality?

How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

Did you notice that Harry Reid had an opportunity to change the Senate rules on filibuster? The Democrats are only locked down in the Senate because they got their priorities mixed up. Harry Reid is *just now* looking at the 'nuclear' option in **2013** (and even then only for judicial appointments, the republicans WILL NOT stop at appointments and Reid knows that he's opening the door for a full blown nuclear option when/if they retake the Senate.) And now they're rolling back implementation even on what they DID get done. These people in the party establishment aren't serious about governing with liberal policies. \n\n&gt;Because that's the way the fucking useless Senate is designed- to allow a determined minority to delay everything practically forever.\n\nNot really. The Senate wasn't designed to require a 60 vote supermajority and you're well aware of that. They had time to pass landmark healthcare, they could have spent that time on filibuster reform and the past 5 years would have gone quite a bit differently (and they would have been able to pass healthcare anyway.) But as an institution they have no spine.\n\n&gt;And of course President Obama didn't have complete freedom to do whatever he wanted. \n\nI'm not saying that he did.\n\n&gt;I could easily imagine someone like Max Baucus or Joe Lieberman throwing up an objection which would have brought the whole thing to an end.\n\nThey spent more time on Bernie Sanders than on 'moderates' like Lieberman from the reportage I was seeing. That makes sense because Sanders is a socialist and as a party the democrats had long supported single-payer (because it actually makes sense in the context of the Democratic party's ideology and philosophical underpinnings) and he was horrified to see a deal that essentially created a new (and captive) market for private insurers. I think they hammered out a particular provision with Baucus but memory escapes me what it was.\n\n&gt;If even a single Democratic Senator was opposed, it wouldn't get through the Senate.\n\nWell who am I to hold accountable for that other than Harry Reid? If Democrats had championed filibuster reform *first* they could still have been *governing* today, but that isn't what they're interested in doing. They can't even police their own party: after gun control flopped at the beginning of this term the major donors pushed for culling the bluedogs from party funding and even THAT was no go. This is the gang who can't shoot straight.\n\n&gt;For all the horrible flaws Lieberman had, it was still useful to have him in office rather than a Republican (he did vote for Obamacare, the stimulus, and many other useful pieces of legislation after all).\n\nIrrelevant. He's an independent, and we're talking about Democrats. Besides, useful legislation? A lot of these guys pretend to be moderates but he himself (and quite a few Democrats) [was drinking the neoconservative kool aid.](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00236)\n\nI agree that voters should look at the affirmative arguments for a given candidate but shouldn't they also look at the negative? I don't think somebody like Reid is worth voting for if he's going to get up and pretend to represent the 'liberal' party and then use that position to reauthorize the neoconservative policies of the Bush administration, all the while crying crocodile tears about the republican obstructionism he chose to subject his party to.\n\n&gt;Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nWere *you* paying attention in 2009? Scott Brown '09 is a showpiece for my point about the role of money in politics. Anybody who was watching the money had a good sense that Brown was going to win that one.\n\nJust so the question is clear: how much is too much for you? If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for? I'm not comfortable saying 'my vote is for double-taps and soft money in government and an institution that can't enforce its will or even keep it's leadership on-message.' So no, the D's can earn my vote as individuals but I'm very skeptical about the institution of their party (likewise Republicans, the Tea Party, The Green Party).

Please engage with the example and substantiate your point further so that I can respond.\n\n&gt;Have you any reason for doubting their sincerity other than your complaint about the ~3 months in 2009 when you think they could have passed election reform?\n\nI would have to go back to a completely different caucus and then we're just going to argue about the pertinence of the example... the last time Democrats controlled all three houses before that congress would have been before the midterms in Clinton's second term. They've only pushed this issue when they knew their bill was a non-starter, how is that not a greenwash?", "id": "t1_cb7rxix", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt;So in a runoff between Pol Pot and Stalin who are you going to vote for? I know it's an absurd question but I'm posing an extreme example to you only to emphasize the point about the shortcomings of approaching voting as realpolitik.\n\nProbably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted]. Pol Pot killed about 25% of his population in 4 years whereas Stalin killed only 10-20% of his population over 30 years. That's a big difference! But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\n&gt;we don't live in a society that separates their moral judgments from their voting judgements.\n\nI disagree. People are highly strategic in their voting judgments, and a very high percentage of voters do so despite feeling that they're choosing between the \"lesser of two evils\".\n\n&gt;Of course not (this is a straw man argument, I don't reject the process of voting, on the contrary I want to improve it!)\n\nI mean the voting process *in its current state*. By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\n&gt;My example was the NRA (an extremely effective organizing group that serves an influential bloc of single-issue voters.)\n\nNRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election. Their political clout comes primarily through a well-funded lobbying effort and their loyalty tests in the Republican primary.\n\n&gt;They've only pushed this issue when they knew their bill was a non-starter, how is that not a greenwash?\n\nBut it's almost *always* been a non-starter, and that's almost exclusively due to the inflexible positions taken by Republicans. The scarce few moments it's actually had a chance have had to be shared with several other vitally important issues that were just seeing a glimmer of the light of day. Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\". You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nThe obstruction of Republicans is *far* more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.", "id": "t1_cb7syi2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "johnpseudo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt; Probably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted].

But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\nBy taking this position you've essentially admitted that your position is non-viable (go try to convince Joe America that you're justified in your willingness to vote for either Stalin or Pol Pot.) I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality? Is it not entirely self-evident (from your POV) that voters care about these issues?\n\n&gt;By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\nI've explicitly disclaimed this notion in the CMV post, and in previous responses to you. How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.

The US system is extremely representative, especially when compared to many other liberal democracies.\n\n&gt;Are bills that enact widely supported policy provisions being passed?\n\nYes, but by definition, \"widely supported\" means \"a majority\". With protections in place for minority opinions, this can take a while between a policy idea's inception and it actually getting enough support to pass with most ideas failing to gain enough popular support. If you support an unpopular idea and surround yourself with others who share your opinion, it can create an illusion that your idea has popular support when it does not and thus it appears that the system is against you.\n\n&gt;Are groups being represented equally?\n\nThis depends what you mean by \"groups\" and \"equally\". The American system is built so individuals are represented equally. Groups such as political parties, interest groups, and corporations are only as powerful as the amount of votes they control (the people who support the ideas they forward). This means that the AARP, which represents the interests and opinions of the elderly, has more power than, say, the local Homeowner's Association. In the case of corporations, the ability to pay for advertising for a campaign controls a lot of votes (in theory at least), but is nowhere near as strong as interest group control over popular opinion. It's a popular idea that money = power, but it's only as effective as the size of the unaffiliated public (that doesn't already tie its interests to another group) that bases its votes on advertising.\n\nAs for political parties, the voting system, known as Single-Member District Plurality (or called by the dysphemism \"First Past the Post\" that betrays a horrible misunderstanding of statistics) forces there to be two parties in power due to Duverger's Law. For those familiar with the multi-party systems inherent in other kinds of voting systems, this can seem like an extreme limiting of choice. However, in practice it doesn't turn out like that. In two-party systems, many different factions come together to form coalitions *before* elections occur (rather than afterwards, like in multi-party systems). Primary elections are the most important process in determining government policy. The winner-take-all nature of elections also means that a representative is accountable to his constituents and needs to keep in contact and cater to their interests if they want to stay in office. This means that voters have power all the time instead of just during election season (evidence for this happening can be seen in approval ratings for people's own representatives, which are usually quite high despite the low approval of congress in general). Multi-party systems make their representatives accountable to their party leadership alone (Even if you go against the interests of your constituents, as long as you hold the party line, you can be moved up the lists so your seat is guaranteed even if the party does poorly in your district).\n\nNow, as to your other post on CMV, you seem to be confused about the purposes of the Legislature and the Presidency. The legislature is what controls most policy. The President has a lot of power, but for most purposes is just a figurehead. When you vote for a president, you're not voting for a dictator, you're voting for someone who you can trust to make good decisions at their own discretion even if the public is against them. The president is a check against both the \"tyranny of the majority\" and bureaucratic insulation from society. They might present partisan ideas in their campaigns to convince people that they are the kind of person they can trust to make good decisions (because if they believe what I do, they must be smart, right?), but nothing is intended as binding. The reality is, most people competent enough to do politics are capable of this job, so the \"lesser of two evils\" style voting is effective in putting the better candidate in the position. One could argue that Proportional Representation would be good for presidential elections while maintaining Single-Member District Plurality for the Legislature because it give a wider pool of applicants without damaging the public's ability to impact policy (the president won't listen to you, personally, no matter what because that's not his job).\n\nI'm not sure all this is answering what you're asking.

Cecile Richards? The American system is built so that individuals are represented *on the basis of their political power.* That means voting blocs that can mobilize and effectively execute strategies. The principle of one person one vote doesn't get you to equal representation.\n\n&gt;As for political parties, the voting system, known as Single-Member District Plurality (or called by the dysphemism \"First Past the Post\" that betrays a horrible misunderstanding of statistics) forces there to be two parties in power due to Duverger's Law.\n\nI'm familiar to Duverger's Law and I don't think that we have to throw our hands up and surrender to it. Having said that I don't think that the two-party duopoly has to fall into the ocean for the problems with the electoral system to be resolved or for the government to be representative. We can live with Duverger's law and still deliver a great deal of choice.\n\n&gt;However, in practice it doesn't turn out like that.

Now, despite the fact that we don't have a multi-party system, our reps can freely go against the interests of their constituents.\n\nOn the whole, I feel familiar with this argument, although I commend you for being particularly articulate in delivering it. I found it convincing when it's underpinnings were consistent with the realities on the ground. Clearly, that is not the case.\n\nEdit:\n\n&gt;The US system is extremely representative, especially when compared to many other liberal democracies.\n\nEven accepting this assertion (which I'm not inclined to do) does the comparative quality of representation reflect the intrinsic quality of representation?

The President can accomplish this while still maintaining the legitimacy of popular election.\n\n&gt;That's a pretty low bar\n\nThis paragraph is talking exclusively about presidential elections. In Legislative elections, the candidate that best represents the interests of the constituency is elected. Now, the constituency only counts as people who vote, and *especially* people who vote in primaries because that's where the real competition for ideas is. Since you don't vote, your ideas don't matter and thus will not become policy. You can make your ideas matter by taking part in primaries. The real question is why more people don't take part in primaries. The answer to that is that incumbent seats are endangered by any change to the primary voting population (why throw in a wildcard when the group that actually cares about primaries voted you in last election), so primaries are nowhere near as well advertised. Voting against incumbents in Primary elections is a far more effective strategy to protest the status quo than sitting out of elections.\n\n&gt;Aren't laws being passed at a historically low rate?\n\n[No.](http://i.imgur.com/paVIfTT.jpg) There doesn't seem to be a real trend of number of bills passing except that 2009 was a historic low since pre-Civil War (2010-2012 have been about average for the past century).

The trust these people have in the leaders in not unfounded, if they don't think the leader is representing their interests anymore, they'll just leave the group and the leader loses power as his supporters break away.\n\n&gt;I'm familiar to Duverger's Law and *I don't think that we have to throw our hands up and surrender to it*\n\nThen I don't think you understand the concept of a \"law\".

This is exactly how it works in practice. Your cynicism is unfounded. Just because you wrote a letter to your representative and it didn't change his mind doesn't mean the thousands of letters written to the same guy that oppose your viewpoint weren't effective.

It's a bad practice and it would probably be better to let unelected bodies draw district boundaries, but it doesn't create the same protection from constituents that party lists do. It also isn't as common as it's often portrayed, though dense cities seem to attract this practice.\n\nI apologize if this any of this sounded condescending, but you seem to have made up your mind as to what you think actually happens when in reality those ideas are a cynical fantasy.

I'm sure somebody can benefit from the civics lesson anyway. From a moral standpoint when we consider signature strikes or Gitmo the POTUS is primary because, as you point out, he gives the actual orders. That doesn't absolve congress nor have I, I simply said that the POTUS gets the brunt (and should.)\n\nLet's have the next one:\n\n&gt;You have to realize that these individuals are politically powerful because they represent the interests of voters and a subset of the population trusts them to tell them how to vote. Political power and votes are exactly the same thing.\n\nI already do realize this, but Grover Norquist and Cecile Richards are my examples because they clearly are not the sort of people you describe. Rather, they are the people who have been presented as such on the basis of their ability to raise funds rather than to rally voters. Political power is in the votes, I agree, but the precursor is no longer good ideas or qualifications but strong enough funding. (Without the money you aren't viable.) \n\nHere's one that's pretty glaring and petty:\n\n&gt;Then I don't think you understand the concept of a \"law\". It's a law in the scientific sense, not the legal sense. It's descriptive, not prescriptive. It describes the chain of causality between plurality voting and two-party systems.\n\nNo, as I already said, I'm familiar with Duverger's law. I don't think you're grasping the concept of *surrender.* We should not consider Duverger's law a reason to turn away from third parties, to forget about federal election reform, or to otherwise ignore the unhealthy state of the two major parties, one of which is stagnate and needs more primary challengers (the democrats) and the other of which is imploding from too much infighting (the republicans.)\n\nHere's the next one:\n\n&gt;Just because you wrote a letter to your representative and it didn't change his mind doesn't mean the thousands of letters written to the same guy that oppose your viewpoint weren't effective.\n\nI'm not arguing that *my* interests aren't being served. I'm arguing that the people aren't being served. As in their well-being, education and livelihood.\n\n&gt;You have to realize the immense scale of people governments deal with, also that humans are inherently really shitty at contemplating immense scales.\n\nI'm aware of this dynamic. Still, the government isn't representative or acting in the interest of the people in their districts when they, for example, fail to pass a budget or pass unfunded mandates to essential agencies like, let's say, the post office. Rhetorical and semantic acrobatics can dress that up, but the problem will remain.\n\nAs an aside: I would hardly say that identifying a problem and advocating reasoned discussion of the same is cynical. Dismal approval ratings for congress are holding and (despite your argument to the contrary which seems to leave out that this congress presently serving is on track to be the least productive in US history and \"can't even pass a fucking farm bill\") low levels of legislative productivity provide the foundation for my concern. So no, my position is neither cynical nor unfounded.\n\nAnother one: you wrote of the multi-party system\n\n&gt;(Even if you go against the interests of your constituents, as long as you hold the party line, you can be moved up the lists so your seat is guaranteed even if the party does poorly in your district).\n\nTo which I wrote\n\n&gt;We've gotten around that drawback by drawing more safe seats.\n\nAnd you then replied\n\n&gt;Gerrymandering can't protect you from primaries.\n\nWell that isn't what I said at all is it? The question isn't whether or not gerrymandering can protect you from a primary challenge, it's whether it can insulate you from having to respond to the needs of the people in your district. If gerrymandering didn't insulate elected officials from pressure to run a more representative office then why would anybody bother with it? The express purpose is to dilute the voting power of a particular bloc...\n\nThat covers most of it. I hope you'll have a chance to respond to my actual position rather than the one you ended up arguing with, but nevertheless I appreciate you taking the time to write me your lengthy and detailed response.\n\nThe only thing I wanted to leave to the end was this\n\n&gt;I apologize if this any of this sounded condescending, but you seem to have made up your mind as to what you think actually happens when in reality those ideas are a cynical fantasy.\n\nI would love to discover, to my surprise, that government was operating ideally, that everything was perfect. After all, how representative government is will be a matter of degrees and not a binary. You're right that I've already made up my mind: I'm for a maximally representative government. It is not a fantasy for me to say that I have enough information to conclude that government could be and ought to be more representative, even if I'm not familiar with every detail of the machinations (which isn't practical for anybody.)\n\n&gt;The \"reality on the ground\" is that the system is, for the most part, not the problem. The problem is that many opinionated people aren't educated in basic civics and thus get frustrated when their ideas aren't listened to (because they're using the system wrong).\n\nWell based on this we can confirm that your previously quoted apology was intended to be backhanded, but let's set that aside. You're telling me that the system isn't the problem, but what REALLY frustrates you is the opinionated people who didn't receive adequate civics education and are now complaining about how the system that gave them that education doesn't respond to their needs and they don't understand how to use it? That sounds like you're making my case for a more responsive government...\n\nEdit: I forgot to ask.\n\nLet's grant you that government IS representative and that this is satisfactory. Aren't voters then morally obliged to withhold their vote from candidates that would engage in immoral behavior (e.g. double taps)?\n\nAnnnd I missed one\n\n&gt;Voting against incumbents in Primary elections is a far more effective strategy to protest the status quo than sitting out of elections.\n\nAs though I were suggesting one should not vote in primaries? Nowhere is that the case. Calling for federal election reform and some recognition that there are systemic problems (gerrymandering, you acknowledge, could be addressed more thoroughly for instance) does not preclude one from voting in primaries. And you don't have to agree with the way I use my ballot in order to agree with my assessment that we need federal election reform as much as immigration or education or tax or healthcare reform.", "id": "t1_cb540ba", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cb514wn", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1430425508, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1374139964, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cb540ba", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1374136087", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cb4zdtm", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1430426933, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cb514wn", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1374123311", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cb4ynli", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1430427759, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1374119272, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cb4zdtm", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1374117840", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;Yes. The US system is extremely representative, especially when compared to many other liberal democracies.\n\nAre you sure about that? In what way is it more representative?\n\nIn terms of like-to-like representation the US system is pretty terrible, whilst the 113th Congress looks to be more diverse, none previously have been. Blacks get the best representation, and that's down to gerrymandering rather than true representation, and even then it's only in the House where they have about 10.1% of the House seats, and are 12.6% of the population, and a single one in the Senate.\n\nOther minorities do much worse, Hispanics make up 16.4% of the population, but have only 30 in the House, a proportion of only 6.8%, and in the Senate, just 3.\n\nIt's not just minorities, there are only 98 women in the whole of Congress, 78 in the House and just 20 in the Senate. \n\nNow compare this to other Western liberal democracies, namely European countries, Sweden is one of the best in this category, a gender split of 55% / 45%. The [International Human Development Indicator](http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/indicators/83506.html) places the US at 100th place (the default setting is on overall HDI) below countries like Venezuela, Indonesia and even the UAE. And definitely below other liberal democracies.\n\nOn racial representation, it's more difficult in Europe, simply because you have a lot more homogeneous countries with usually over 85% of a single majority.\n\nAnother way I can see representation is through views being represented, and first-past-the-post fails in that. PR gives the voter much more choice, in the German system, you have 6 parties. Those 6 parties aren't the total in Parliament, they are the total in government. Surely that's much more representative than possibly having 49% of your district / state / country ignored? Even in the only FPTP left in Europe, that being the UK, we have multiple parties. With 2 major, Conservative and Labour, one semi major being Lib Dems, and then a smattering of smaller parties the UK looks to be still more representative.\n\nFinally, you have actual representation, how many people do you need to represent. The US is by far the worst in this category, though I could suppose that's due to it's size. However 535 federal representatives is still a fairly small government, the UK has only 66 million people, and has 625 MP's, plus 750 or so Lords (Who might be unelected, but are still representatives).\n\n**TL;DR The US federal system is one of the least representative liberal democracies, and is actually less representative than many non-liberal democracies in some respects.**", "id": "t1_cb53673", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "naryn", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "It's more representative because it put constituents in power rather than party elites. Ethnic and gender representation is a bit of a red herring because America is a civic nation rather than an ethnic one, so you don't need a Latino in office to represent Latino interests, a black representative is just as capable of representing Latino interests. The fact that it's disproportionately white men in office has more to do with historical trends of institutionalized racism and sexism that persist in offices that prefer a lot of experience (women and minorities haven't had equal opportunities for long enough to have a proportional amount of old people with enough political experience to be elected to federal office). These old white men are just as vulnerable to being coerced by minority votes as old black, Hispanic, or Asian men or women. \n\nAs for the proportion of Representatives to population, there's no evidence that the size of a political body has any bearing on how representatives vote. The only thing more representatives causes is higher overhead costs in running the government. \n\nI already covered why plurality voting and the resulting two party system puts more policy making power in the hands of constituents. In Germany, those six parties have hard party lines that are controlled by party elites and won't change to fit the will of the constituents. Then they form post-election coalitions that end up only serving the interests of the plurality party (which is given complete control as long as the coalition survives), so 60-70% of the population is unrepresented by those controlling policy. Two party systems, on the other hand only alienate people who vote for their seat's non-incumbent every time (about 35%), everyone else has a chance to use the threat of their vote to enforce their will on their representative, even if (especially if) they voted against him. In practice this gives you complete ideological freedom instead of having to choose between 4-10 strict and unbending platforms that only care about forwarding their ideology rather than building trusting relationships with constituents in order to buy their votes.\n\nAs you point out, there's a lot of ways to define how \"representative\" a government is.

I'd stipulate your notion that what matters is who can effect policy as far as this question goes. Having said that, we can't go on using an idealized and theoretical 'individual voter'. In a presidential race doesn't the swing-district voter have more power in this sense? Or the primary voter? What if your state doesn't have open primaries?

Money buys advertising which raises awareness of a candidate and therefore possible votes. The average voter still holds the power in the end and can choose not to be swayed by the advertisements paid for by rich donors. Put simply, the power of donors is only in their ability to get votes. If Donor A buys a commercial that convinces 22 people to vote for Candidate B, those 22 people have the same power as another random selection of 22 voters in the district.

What if you're a 20 year member of the opposition party? Not everybody should have to call themselves a R or D in order to fully exercise their franchise and open primaries can give the people that freedom.\n\n&gt;Money is power only by proxy in politics.\n\nNo money is viability in politics: without the money you're sunk and nobody will support you because they know you're going to lose.

Because elections cannot be universally fair there's no sense in having them be fair at all? This is quite cynical. Not that it matters, you already acknowledge that they get pandered to 'a lot more.' By your definition *that is political power* so you've already acknowledged that the voter doesn't have equal power.

Just as they were nearing the finish line, Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nYes I was paying attention in '09. Did you notice that Harry Reid had an opportunity to change the Senate rules on filibuster? The Democrats are only locked down in the Senate because they got their priorities mixed up. Harry Reid is *just now* looking at the 'nuclear' option in **2013** (and even then only for judicial appointments, the republicans WILL NOT stop at appointments and Reid knows that he's opening the door for a full blown nuclear option when/if they retake the Senate.) And now they're rolling back implementation even on what they DID get done. These people in the party establishment aren't serious about governing with liberal policies. \n\n&gt;Because that's the way the fucking useless Senate is designed- to allow a determined minority to delay everything practically forever.\n\nNot really. The Senate wasn't designed to require a 60 vote supermajority and you're well aware of that. They had time to pass landmark healthcare, they could have spent that time on filibuster reform and the past 5 years would have gone quite a bit differently (and they would have been able to pass healthcare anyway.) But as an institution they have no spine.\n\n&gt;And of course President Obama didn't have complete freedom to do whatever he wanted. \n\nI'm not saying that he did.\n\n&gt;I could easily imagine someone like Max Baucus or Joe Lieberman throwing up an objection which would have brought the whole thing to an end.\n\nThey spent more time on Bernie Sanders than on 'moderates' like Lieberman from the reportage I was seeing. That makes sense because Sanders is a socialist and as a party the democrats had long supported single-payer (because it actually makes sense in the context of the Democratic party's ideology and philosophical underpinnings) and he was horrified to see a deal that essentially created a new (and captive) market for private insurers. I think they hammered out a particular provision with Baucus but memory escapes me what it was.\n\n&gt;If even a single Democratic Senator was opposed, it wouldn't get through the Senate.\n\nWell who am I to hold accountable for that other than Harry Reid? If Democrats had championed filibuster reform *first* they could still have been *governing* today, but that isn't what they're interested in doing. They can't even police their own party: after gun control flopped at the beginning of this term the major donors pushed for culling the bluedogs from party funding and even THAT was no go. This is the gang who can't shoot straight.\n\n&gt;For all the horrible flaws Lieberman had, it was still useful to have him in office rather than a Republican (he did vote for Obamacare, the stimulus, and many other useful pieces of legislation after all).\n\nIrrelevant. He's an independent, and we're talking about Democrats. Besides, useful legislation? A lot of these guys pretend to be moderates but he himself (and quite a few Democrats) [was drinking the neoconservative kool aid.](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00236)\n\nI agree that voters should look at the affirmative arguments for a given candidate but shouldn't they also look at the negative? I don't think somebody like Reid is worth voting for if he's going to get up and pretend to represent the 'liberal' party and then use that position to reauthorize the neoconservative policies of the Bush administration, all the while crying crocodile tears about the republican obstructionism he chose to subject his party to.\n\n&gt;Scott Brown unexpectedly got elected and there were tons of news stories predicting that that meant the entire bill was dead.\n\nWere *you* paying attention in 2009? Scott Brown '09 is a showpiece for my point about the role of money in politics. Anybody who was watching the money had a good sense that Brown was going to win that one.\n\nJust so the question is clear: how much is too much for you? If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for? I'm not comfortable saying 'my vote is for double-taps and soft money in government and an institution that can't enforce its will or even keep it's leadership on-message.' So no, the D's can earn my vote as individuals but I'm very skeptical about the institution of their party (likewise Republicans, the Tea Party, The Green Party). Aren't liberals such as yourself better served by supporting individual candidates and not the party? Especially when the party as an organization isn't liberal at all?\n\nEdit: Spelling, formatting, grammar", "id": "t1_cb5xmin", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; It is an endorsement, that's the system of voting that we have.

What makes you think of the vote as an endorsement?\n\n&gt;If Candidate A runs a group that shoots first responders (POTUS) and Candidate B wants to run the same operation (Romney) who are you voting for?\n\nThat depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that. If polls were to say that only 10-20% of the population supports shooting first responders, and that the issue is very important, I could see how abstaining from voting and focusing on getting a new constitutional convention would make sense. But if polls were to say that 70-80% of the population supports shooting first responders, then abstaining from the vote isn't going to accomplish anything.\n\n&gt;Aren't liberals such as yourself better served by supporting individual candidates and not the party? Especially when the party as an organization isn't liberal at all?\n\nOf course I do focus on individual candidates. I would never donate money to or actively promote a conservative Democrat in another state. Because I have plenty of progressive Democrats around the country to choose from.

Your vote counts for one person and can *only be cast once, and only for one person, and only from one person per person per election*. You can only vote *affirmatively* and therefore may not express preference, whereas in instant runoff voting none of the above is true and one MAY express preference by listing their preferences in order. When write-in ballots are permitted I always participate on the basis of the above rationale and that scenario presenting an exception to the same. Isn't voting clearly a selection? As in 'this one gets my vote, I want her!' In order to express the political will consistent with the expression 'I want this one but if I can't have it that way I'll take Nixon instead and then if they both lose I'll take Pol Pot' in the form of a ballot one would necessarily require a runoff style ballot would they not?\n\n&gt;That depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that.\n\nWhat the hell does that mean? We're voting, it's decision time. Secret ballots, nobody finds out until afterward. As to the point about polling you're missing the point. If voting is a meaningful expression of your political will at all then does it not affix some moral complicity to the voter when the government they put into office acts? If you're telling me that when you vote you do not make a moral affirmation of the candidate that has earned your vote then how do you enforce your will that your government should be a force for good?

It clearly creates an incentive for them to pursue election reform when I present an invalid ballot.\n\n&gt;On a public basis...\n\nI don't see how any of this passage is pertinent. I'm not walking away from these candidates because they aren't sending me a car to take me to the polling place or spending a dime on me. I'm walking away from their policies. I use all available information to the best of my ability.\n\n&gt;which is what I thought your stance was\n\nIt is my stance but as far as I'm concerned people are crazy for not doing everything they can (including tell blatant lies) in order to get marked down by pollsters as undecided. Anything else is just asking to be ignored and there is absolutely no duty or rational reason to be honest to pollsters (they already consider your statements biased by self-selection.)\n\n&gt;You're confusing...\n\nI'm not confusing anything or talking about how candidates do anything except when you challenge me on that basis (refer to my above point about how invalid ballots are viewed by democrats as 'votes left on the table.') I would rather you answer my fundamental question to you: what is the line that a candidate must cross before you will refuse to vote for them under any circumstance? Do you even have one?\n\nBut we don't have to compare our experiences in politics for me to be skeptical of your point. If candidates don't care about invalid votes, why would they ever move on the issue of election reform anyway? Thats why I cited movetoamend.org: they have a realistic goal that doesn't involve passing a bill through the three houses, and has the potential to enact real election reform.\n\nEdit: sorry about the long delay and poor formating/spelling.

But I suppose it's possible you aren't being ignored by some candidates. I'm just saying that, in general, most candidates aren't going to pick up on the \"message\" you're sending. So the net impact of your vote is going to be smaller than if you were to actually vote for one of the candidates.\n\nWe've gotten away from some of the substance of your decision though, which is what I find most confusing. You've got the Democratic party, which actively pushes election reform any time there's a chance it would work. You started out by trying to use the DISCLOSE Act as an example of good legislation that Democrats refused to pass. The actual vote shows that it was actually all Democrats vs. all Republicans. It just seems to me that what we need is more Democrats in power, so that they can either pass it unilaterally or an extended period of political irrelevance will force Republicans to reform their party.

What makes you think it's hard to 'get' that anyway? It's no harder than for a position on some other issue (e.g. pro-choice/life). To say that what I'm doing isn't a viable or effective ignores the enormous influence already garnered by organizers who espouse the usage of this tactic (e.g. the NRA.)\n\nPoint of process: I have made an effort to respond to each of your points in every case, and offered to address any point you feel unsatisfied with in greater depth. On the other hand, one of my critical questions for you\n\n&gt;I would rather you answer my fundamental question to you: what is the line that a candidate must cross before you will refuse to vote for them under any circumstance?\n\ngoes unanswered despite my having repeated it at least twice. Please respond.\n\nEdit: \n\n&gt;That seems like something a politician would say if they're already fans of election reform.\n\nWhy is that worth commenting on? A great deal of what you've said thus far could easily have been said by a partisan congressional democrat but I don't see the pertinence of either comment. If your point is that something like Bush v Gore wasn't a wake up call to politicians who weren't cognizant of the major problems our election system has institutionalized then I don't really see where you're getting that from.", "id": "t1_cb7rc4v", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt; You're right, what would really help is if they were sincere about wanting it.\n\nHave you any reason for doubting their sincerity other than your complaint about the ~3 months in 2009 when you think they could have passed election reform?\n\n&gt;how is single-issue voting on election reform less legitimate than on other issues?\n\nI never said it was. They're all ineffective uses of the vote.\n\n&gt;what is the line that a candidate must cross before you will refuse to vote for them under any circumstance?\n\nI already answered that:\n\n&gt;That depends on how the nation as a whole feels about that. If polls were to say that only 10-20% of the population supports [crossing that line], and that the issue is very important, I could see how abstaining from voting and focusing on getting a new constitutional convention would make sense. But if polls were to say that 70-80% of the population supports [crossing that line], then abstaining from the vote isn't going to accomplish anything.\n\nSo no, there's no line that, if crossed, would lead me to think that abstaining from the vote would be a good decision. It depends on the degree to which that objectionable policy is accepted by the rest of the country. I already am shocked/outraged/disgusted by much of what the government does, but unless a lot of other people feel the same way, that doesn't make rejecting the entire voting process any more of a viable a way of changing the system.

I know it's an absurd question but I'm posing an extreme example to you only to emphasize the point about the shortcomings of approaching voting as realpolitik.\n\nProbably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted]. Pol Pot killed about 25% of his population in 4 years whereas Stalin killed only 10-20% of his population over 30 years. That's a big difference! But in all likelihood I'd be focusing on doing my best to bring down either one of those governments from the inside.\n\n&gt;we don't live in a society that separates their moral judgments from their voting judgements.\n\nI disagree. People are highly strategic in their voting judgments, and a very high percentage of voters do so despite feeling that they're choosing between the \"lesser of two evils\".\n\n&gt;Of course not (this is a straw man argument, I don't reject the process of voting, on the contrary I want to improve it!)\n\nI mean the voting process *in its current state*. By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\n&gt;My example was the NRA (an extremely effective organizing group that serves an influential bloc of single-issue voters.)\n\nNRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election. Their political clout comes primarily through a well-funded lobbying effort and their loyalty tests in the Republican primary.\n\n&gt;They've only pushed this issue when they knew their bill was a non-starter, how is that not a greenwash?\n\nBut it's almost *always* been a non-starter, and that's almost exclusively due to the inflexible positions taken by Republicans. The scarce few moments it's actually had a chance have had to be shared with several other vitally important issues that were just seeing a glimmer of the light of day. Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\". You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nThe obstruction of Republicans is *far* more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.", "id": "t1_cb7syi2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "johnpseudo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "&gt; Probably Stalin [assuming it's an alternative universe where the votes are still being counted].

I'm very interested in where this tangent takes us but let's not let it distract us too much.\n\nAs to whether moral judgements are made by voters: if you don't think voters make moral judgements about candidates why is pro-choice/life such an important wedge issue? Civil rights for the LGBT community? Are these not issues of morality? Is it not entirely self-evident (from your POV) that voters care about these issues?\n\n&gt;By voting 'invalid', (my impression of your actions is that) you're rejecting the validity/worth of the vote as its presented to you and calling for reforms that would make voting for someone on the ballot worthwhile.\n\nI've explicitly disclaimed this notion in the CMV post, and in previous responses to you. How do you substantiate this interpretation of my position? I have argued that it is precisely because I believe that my vote is *meaningful* that makes it ramify to my moral identity.\n\n&gt;NRA voters are not single-issue voters with regard to the general election.\n\nAs much as I'm inclined to argue with you about whether or not the NRA is a single-issue-voting bloc, there is a more clear cut example in Americans For Tax Reform (another organization that has a substantial portion of influence, I am sure you agree.) Their pledge (No New Taxes) is the epitome of single issue voting, both for the voter and for the legislator.\n\n&gt;Your stance amounts to saying \"since you didn't prioritize election reform over health reform/economic reform/environmental reform, you must not care about it at all!\".\n\nNo. As I previously stated, I know that when they controlled the Senate they didn't pursue procedural reform (which would have given them MUCH more time to pursue all the issues you listed.) More than being unconvinced that Democrats are up to the task of election reform, I'm not even convinced that they want to govern. If they wanted to govern, where is the 'will to power?' Because of their intransigence all it will take to roll back all their policies is as 51 member majority in the Senate for Rs (because we both know they won't hesitate to go ahead with the 'nuclear option.')\n\n&gt;You're just vastly overestimating what Congress could have done in that brief period of time, given the 100% opposition by Republicans, the procedural delays, and the existence of a few blue-dog Democrats who probably weren't on board.\n\nNo I'm saying that those were problems of their own choosing (inasmuch as they declined to first reform the senate procedures so that they could actually *govern*.)\n\nAt least I can say of the progressive caucus that they have a spine and a budget. They're serious about governing (unlike the DNC.) Even the policies that they (the DNC) were willing to pass (like the Affordable Care Act) are *Republican* policies.\n\nConsider this POTUS and his record:\n\n*Healthcare plan (other than single-payer, so, conservative policy.)\n\n*Gun control (No movement on the issue in the first term, too afraid of southern racists to push it in the second term so he delegated the push after Sandy Hook to Sen. Dianne Feinstein and VPOTUS Joe Biden.)\n\n*Economic reform (Ha! What economic reform? Are you talking about Dodd-Frank? Because that was toothless and didn't even include the Volker rule, as you well know. Brokers on Wall Street and major donors alike are telling me that they don't expect Obama to move the status quo even a little.)\n\n*Foreign Policy (President Obama has normalized the neoconservative policies of the former administration, isn't that so?)\n\n*Criminal Justice (POTUS Obama is the third president to see overall incarceration rise during his administration. The DNC supported FISA amendments act and the NDAA's contain language that is obviously intended to provide government with the legal framework to circumvent due process. The school-to-prison pipeline has expanded in terms of scope and volume of persons passing through it under this and the previous administration.)\n\n&gt;The obstruction of Republicans is far more important to the failure of election reform than anything else.\n\nMy point doesn't contradict this thesis. My point is that these establishment Democrats *are* Republicans.\n\nEdit: I forgot immigration. POTUS Obama has increased deportation over the previous administration (including in the period of time since his 'deferred prosecution' executive action. He is also poised to pass a reform bill that would not include a pathway to citizenship but *would* militarize the southern border.)", "id": "t1_cb84i39", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "selftext": "Hey OPA, I read your post, but I'm not interested in continuing this discussion.
