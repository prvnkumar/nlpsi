It's kind of a complicated issue because you could argue that if a government is not sufficiently representative of the people, then taxes could easily be perceived as theft. On the other hand if you live in a functioning democracy, taxes could be seen as a completely legitimate agreement arrived at through the democratic process. Taxes fund schools, libraries, national defense, and infrastructure maintenance for sewage systems, roads, water, and electricity. Without these things the average citizen would certainly be worse off.\n\nThat is what I normally say to libertarians. I want freedom too, but I want a functioning and properly representative democratic system. If a certain tax rate is agreed upon through this process, then I view it as legitimate and not theft. Not only that but without taxation, basic services would be difficult to fund and we would all suffer as a result.\n\nI like to point to Gilded Age America (post civil war) as an example of a market in which regulation is almost totally absent. This era had extreme wealth inequality and the worst living and working conditions for the average American than nearly any other time in American history. The weekend and the 8 hour day, and an active labor movement, were born out of these conditions.\n\nThe issue of minimum wage is interesting. The economic argument is that minimum wage increases barriers to entry and makes it more difficult for businesses to succeed, as well as raising the price that the market would set for a wage if left alone. Minimum wage exists because without it, people would have trouble accessing basic necessities like shelter, food, education, and health care. So it is an indirect way of ensuring that people have a basic quality of life, and it's a form of wealth redistribution. Again, before the minimum wage there were egregious examples of worker exploitation and abuse. So ultimately I see it as an indirect way of providing the basic necessities to people and forcing some degree of wealth-sharing between employers and employees. There is a labor surplus always for unskilled labor and therefore without unions, labor has very little ability to negotiate for higher wages. In that sense minimum wage really does protect the little guy.\n\nAnyways I'm sorry if this was a little scattered, I hope there was some helpful information.\n\nAlso re: government intervention causing the 2008 financial crisis, that is completely bogus. The problem was a lack of government oversight and deregulation of the financial industry, allowing investment banks and ratings agencies to act completely irresponsibly and knowingly sell debt packages that had no backing.

The reason we have a bill of rights is so that certain individual rights can't be violated just because of a majority vote.  The question here is what is the alternative?  Improving our democratic system and making it genuinely representative of the people is our only hope of having some degree of control over our own destiny.  What would you prefer my friend?  That we turn our destiny over to the private sector and hope that our environment is maintained and people have a decent quality of life?  This possibility has been disproven by our own history in America.\n\n&gt; no, they were born out of an increasingly wealth society that could afford to work less. \n\nThe American labor movement was born out of unsafe working conditions and exploitative employers.  This is not questionable, it is a matter of historical fact.  Look up the Western Federation of Miners.  This union was born out of company towns in Colorado where owners owned the housing the workers lived in, the equipment they used, and the stores they shopped in.  This resulted in perpetual debt for many workers which was equivalent to slavery.  Children as young as 10 worked in these mines and lost limbs or died early due to lung disease from working in the mines.\n\nIt makes no difference how much wealth is being generated if that wealth is concentrated only in the upper echelons, and this is what existed in the Gilded Age.  There is a book called Standing at Armageddon about this era that I recommend you read, it is a nonideological look at the workers' movements of this era.  If you haven't studied this period I encourage you to because it is a case study into a market absent regulation.\n\n&gt; this is just ignorant. the bush administration saw the two largest INCREASES in financial regulation in decades, basel 2 and Sarbanes oxely.\n\n[Gramm-Leach-Bliley](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley_Act) is what is normally credited with assisting the creation of the housing bubble and the 2008 financial crisis.  Joseph Stiglitz has pointed to this act as being the central cause, as well as other prominent economists.  This act repealed parts of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 and allowed a massive DEregulation of the financial industry.\n\nBasel II wasn't implemented until after the 2008 crisis and therefore could not have been responsible, and NO ONE has argued that Sarbanes-Oxley was responsible for the crisis, only that it has stifled new business.

Second, these factory jobs WERE exploitative and the American labor movement WAS born out of these conditions.  The WFM (Western Federation of Miners) only existed because of the working conditions that they faced, and the tight control over their lives by mine owners and operators.  This is a matter of historical fact, I don't understand how you could possibly deny it.\n\nMerely because workers left farm work to go to industrial work does not mean that the industrial work was safe and that these workers had high qualities of life.  In many cases the exact opposite was the case, and that is why unions and the labor movement surged in popularity at the time.\n\n&gt; no, it didn't. living standards for the poorest massively increased in the gilded age. the got lights, running water, and cars all for the first time. \n\nThere were technological advances that caused general increases in quality of life, but there was also extreme inequality of wealth and examples of extreme exploitation.\n\n&gt; While economic and political elites capitalized on America's rapidly expanding wealth, industrial workers struggled to survive the bleak conditions often hidden behind the nation's glittering fa\u00e7ade. Industrial wages were low and hours were long in factories that were typically dangerous and unhealthy. But perhaps worse, the restructuring of work\u2014the subdivision of labor into its unskilled parts\u2014left many workers with few marketable skills and little hope for occupational or social mobility. One consequence of all this was a budding labor movement, as workers banded together to try to force their collective will upon the industrial giants that had dominated them as individuals. Workers' efforts to organize frequently led to long and violent strikes, rocking the economic landscape and even raising the frightening specter of outright class warfare. http://www.shmoop.com/gilded-age/summary.html\n\nIt's fact.

Immigration does not make a country poorer, but it does make a country's STATISTICS look poorer.

Rising divorce rates among the poor, changing norms about compensation, changes in tax law that shifted income from corporate income to personal income, age affects, and other changes have all made US inequality seem worse than it actually is.  And then there is churn.  While some of the top 1% are the descendants of people from the 20s, vast numbers are not.  The amount of creative destruction in the US declined substantially during the middle of the century, largely because of government policy, to the point where John Kenneth Galbraith was able to declare the idea of GM going bankrupt utterly ludicrous, and have that idea widely accepted.  No new mega businesses meant no new mega fortunes, and since fortunes naturally dissipate overtime (as they are split among heirs) this led to fewer mega rich.  In the 80s, it began to rise again, which led to the creation of new fortunes.

When an economy is demand- and, more importantly, credit-constrained, a collapse in nominal GDP has all sorts of really terrible consequences. What's happening in the Euro-zone, and to a less extent England, is a textbook example of a nominal spending crash brought on by insufficient credit expansion.\n\nThe short answer: the Euro-zone is going to be severely struggling for a very long time unless the ECB decides to loosen the money supply.

The government wanted to mantain a high level of social security, but at the same time they cut taxes and got themselves involved in two wars. These things were okay to do, so to speak, because when the economy went well they could just lend money from the future (they lend money from other countries on the mutual understanding that everybody would continue growth in the economy which translates into next years tax income) thus going over budget when the bubble collapsed. With me so far? This is why the public sector is in trouble, but remember the bubble was caused by private spending e.g lending in equity. Some countries had reasonable control with their budget and with the private sector, but others did not. See my other reply for explanation on the relationship between the rich and the not so rich countries in Europe today. \n\nI heard that in Greece and Spain prior to 07 there were wide spread tax fraud (mostly technically, not necessarily in legal terms) so the main problem was not the welfare state, is was the state not going about their business in a responsible manner, considering the huge amount of capital floating around in private enterprises. The question is whether we should cut spending and taxes thus stimulating the economy, or, cut a lesser amount of spending and in stead try to control the private sector so it does not pull a whole national economy in its potential downfall. It's a normative desicion and there's no right answer. \n\nOverall the economists think danish governing is responsible (I will casually include that we have one of the highest tax rates and public sectors in the world, but we're doing fine, all in all).

However when the euro countries have different types of finance politics (because the eurozone didn't reach that far into the sovereign national states) there's no central political coordinance in a crisis as we saw happen in 07-08. On top of that, In the US you will always be able to pay your debt because you have the ability to devalue your currency (cheaper labour). If the Euro got devalued it would be great for Greece, but not so much for Germany and the euro project as a whole in the long run. Greece and co. would be able to pay off their debt, but only with growth at the same time, where's that money and structure going to come from? Exactly, Germany and co.! If the money Germany has to pay to get growth not only to itself but also to the countries in debt, it will have less value to do so if the euro got devalued. Therefore the rich countries pressure the poor countries into spending cuts and reformation of state affairs. This causes riots in the streets and an unstable political and social environment. This has nothing to do with the large public sector in almost all of the countries, it has to do with private debt becoming a public liability. Of course we have to cut spending but doing so in education and healthcare would undermine the vital benefits it produces in future generations (incl. in economics).

You can't call it \"Crony Capitalism\" and dismiss it unless you call every communist country \"crony communist\" as well. Crony Capitalism isn't a form of Capitalism, it is just how Capitalist systems have ended up (Corruption, skewing etc). Maybe a pure Capitalist society would be better, but I still don't think so.  \n  \nNow that isn't fair. I never said it was a road to hell. Personally I think the road to a proper system would involved principles from all other systems (Capitalism, Socialism, Communism, Anarchism etc) because as I said a while ago, ruling with one principle (or even just a handful) is very bad planning.

So the Government in most first world Countries doesn't print the money. Secondly people already do that through item-to-item trading and through the use of alternate currencies like Bit-coins.  \n  \nI don't see how it can be argued. They were just wrongly labeled by others. Karl Marx described the path to the development of a Communist state as a Capitalist state existing, revolution turning it into a socialist state and then another revolution turning it into a communist state.  \nThe path that the USSR took was one of many they could have taken and there were so many factors at play that its wrong to assume communism would have caused all the bad stuff to happen. As always, politics screwed everything up.  \nWell, part of the idea of Communism was that it was releasing people from the obligations and limitations in their life (be it financial or social) to pursue a more creative lifestyle where they seized control of their own production (and thus life). The idea was that this would create a truly free society instead of the phony freedoms represented in Capitalism (are you free to stop paying your mortgage?) where everyone is forced to adhere to a system. Still, that is only one tiny part of Communism and Marxism and not what the system is built on. Anarchy would be a better description of true freedom.

Even if it is affordable by well off farmers currently, that still doesn't account for the spike in premiums once more people start claiming nor does it account for other businesses such as the baker or the truck driver who don't have income insurance like that.  \n  \nYou have mis-interpreted what I meant. What I meant is that it does not support society, but rather a handful of people in that society. Society is made up of many individuals but many individuals do not make up a society. It is only when the individuals stop acting as if no-one else exists and they all start working together, that the society forms. Now it becomes anti-society when the system forces people to compete with each other on things like grain prices...

It is a little extreme but look at it on the macro level.

The under developed economy benefits from the inflow of money but will eventually become too expensive (or in a better word feasible) to continue their labour based industries and will have to look at outsourcing them to another under-developed nation.

Just don't think it is perfect and all mighty.     \n  \nThe reason you didn't give an in depth response has probably more to do with you realising you won't be able to convince me of its validity (although I will agree it works in some areas, just not as an entire system)  \n  \nBut it is! That is what makes great planning, removing all boundaries to the though process. That is why pretty much every text book on planning/management will have a section dedicated to how to brainstorm properly. Unless every boundary is removed for new ideas, possible solutions will be ignored. Introducing principles into decision making and planning is exactly what ruins good planning as you are now removing solutions that clash with your principle.  \n  \nI was just waiting for you to mention Milton Friedman. Everything you have said has pretty much been said by Milton when he argued with Michael Moore about why excluding $15 of plastic that prevents a gas tank from exploding in a car crash, was only \"a matter of principle\". Also, you should note that Milton didn't think there was a moral obligation to provide that $15 of plastic as it didn't match his principle.  \n  \nFinally, Think critically. The whole reason I don't follow any single principle in decision making is because I think critically. You should too. Also, you still don't get that principle doesn't have anything to do with what happened in Spain. It was poor planning with little forward thinking.

Some countries had reasonable control with their budget and with the private sector, but others did not. See my other reply for explanation on the relationship between the rich and the not so rich countries in Europe today. \n\nI heard that in Greece and Spain prior to 07 there were wide spread tax fraud (mostly technically, not necessarily in legal terms) so the main problem was not the welfare state, is was the state not going about their business in a responsible manner, considering the huge amount of capital floating around in private enterprises. The question is whether we should cut spending and taxes thus stimulating the economy, or, cut a lesser amount of spending and in stead try to control the private sector so it does not pull a whole national economy in its potential downfall. It's a normative desicion and there's no right answer. \n\nOverall the economists think danish governing is responsible (I will casually include that we have one of the highest tax rates and public sectors in the world, but we're doing fine, all in all).

There were a few problems, as already explained, in multiple countries adopting a same currency, depsite the fact that they were totally different economies (can't really compare Germany and Greece's economies, how they work, their capital, etc...). The second point was improper investment from individual governments (and companies) within the Eurozone. You also have to blame the world-wide economic slow down following the housing crisis in the US as a major factor (at least in precipitating certain country's downfalls). Also note that Europe is not struggling. Certain areas of the EUROZONE are. Not the same thing at all. Take for instance Switzerland, if my memory serves me right the last unemployement study showed that, nationwide, unemployement was something along the lines of 3.8%, which is like 2.5 times lower than the US, UK, France, and 6-7 times lower than the worst affected countries (Spain, Greece).

The 30s happened to coincide with widespread adoption of the tractor rather than the farmhand as the main unit of doing work in a country where over a third of the population was farmers, creating this thing you may be interested in called \"structural unemployment\" (see: an American economy after a big-computing revolution).\n\nI think there is general agreement, however, that tax cuts by and large have created more debt than they've solved (see the graph above, I suppose). Indeed, rising inequality tacks closely with [rising political polarization, poverty and loss of trust in ones government and neighbors,](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CFEQFjAD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPolarized-America-Ideology-Walras-Pareto-Lectures%2Fdp%2F0262633612&amp;ei=HKrwUKr0I6GyigLQvoHACA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEIHNAZWG4svN3a6X-zsV0ynPZAjw&amp;sig2=VKWTcETSfva6_nrt5PFRVA&amp;bvm=bv.1357700187,d.cGE) and rising inequality is closely related to tax cut policies - though yes, also to policies suggested by lefty economists regarding subsidies (namely, that there should be more of them). Heck, there is even evidence that the radical monetarist idea of [going off the gold standard helped stabilize price levels](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDoQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2F~%2Fmedia%2FProjects%2FBPEA%2F1982%25201%2F1982a_bpea_cooper_dornbusch_hall.PDF&amp;ei=rKvwUJitG4WFiALNrIDwCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHpuhun1DFUAVxTaLUWs1GPxCE_1Q&amp;sig2=gVzKHu3ztlXU3AlpQs-Ewg&amp;bvm=bv.1357700187,d.cGE) and benefited the economy. Deficits by themselves aren't \"bad,\" but it's hard to find inequality that is \"good.\"\n\nYes, I will admit that much of the research on inequality [ignores fringe benefits,](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fceg.berkeley.edu%2Fvisitors_31_3957587764.pdf&amp;ei=S6zwUNnXN8fhiwK1uYHoCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEnKfWuv77fuf_0DqrZ_aMPzuUCIQ&amp;sig2=tIP0a_wDuRP8vyk0aa4xzg&amp;bvm=bv.1357700187,d.cGE) but you can respecify wealth any way you please and still arrive at the inescapable fact that inequality began rising in the US (and around the world) [in the late 1970s](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CEsQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.heritage.org%2Findex%2Fpdf%2F2007%2Findex2007_chapter1.pdf&amp;ei=aKzwUMxc55aMAqfLgLgE&amp;usg=AFQjCNHgEf40UvhHBXGtLUBYAC9lOkXHWA&amp;sig2=B6mEN1YWmnsBFGn5lFZiUw&amp;bvm=bv.1357700187,d.cGE) and that inequality is exacerbated if not caused by what you might identify as \"right\" economic policies. Inequality only seems to be decreasing in [places that develop welfare states.](http://ciber.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Spur/Henisz_The_institutional_environment_EP.pdf)\n\nI would argue that much state-level welfare policy *is* a failure, however. The Housing and Urban Development department largely exists to transfer funds to the political allies of the party in charge, in my view. No one would argue that the \"War on Poverty\" has done much good for black Americans and people whose parents didn't go to college, for example - though that's tangled up with the rather illiberal \"War on Drugs.\"\n\nWas Jimmy Carter a progressive?

The length of the depression was not merely centered in the agrarian center.\n\n&gt;I think there is general agreement, however, that tax cuts by and large have created more debt than they've solved (see the graph above, I suppose).\n\nNot true. If decreasing taxes leads to higher debt,then they would have to result in less revenue necessarily. However this is not the case. Consider the fact that despite more than fifty tax policy changes since World War II, revenue as a percentage of GDP has remained fairly constant at around 19%, as suggested by [Hauser's law.](http://books.google.com/books?id=X7zLmIK1HgEC&amp;num=13&amp;source=gbs_slider_user_shelves_7_homepage) Here is [a graph](http://i.imgur.com/uQrpM.jpg) of all exogenous tax changes with revenue changes over three years. As you can see, there is no direct relationship between tax cuts and lower revenue. (My sources for the tax changes are a [narrative analysis by Christina Romer](http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~cromer/nadraft1108.pdf) and the revenue data comes from the [Federal Reserve](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/).)\n\nThe reason for this is that revenue more closely follows economic growth than actual tax rates, as again suggested by Hauser's law. Thus the best pro-revenue tax policy is a pro-growth policy. As suggested by [Christina Romer's 2007 paper](http://www.nber.org/papers/w13264) which found that increasing taxes by 1% GDP rescinds GDP growth by 3%, the supply-side tax policies are more pro-growth.\n\n&gt;Deficits by themselves aren't \"bad,\" but it's hard to find inequality that is \"good.\"\n\nI refer you to the [Reinhardt-Rogoff paper](http://www.nber.org/papers/w18015) which found that 23 of 26 debt overhangs since World War II were coupled with GDP reduction and, internationally, countries with above 90% debt-to-GDP ratio experience 1.2% less GDP growth. Going by that paper; yes, deficit spending and debt itself, at least at levels seen in recent years, are \"bad.\"\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7w5r5l", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1358093691", "ups": 9, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t3_16eihd", "score": 20, "retrieved_on": 1430932075, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1357950293, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7vccag", "author_flair_text": "[PhD, Former Campaign Tech][Independent]", "created_utc": "1357949494", "ups": 20, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_16eihd", "selftext": "&gt; (Many would argue that the 2008 financial crisis wouldn't have occurred had Glass-Steagall not been repealed).\n\nno one who knows anything about economics or finance would argue that.
