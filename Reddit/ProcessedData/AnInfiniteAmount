The average House district is something like 660,000 people. Let's make that number smaller.

Likewise, it's pretty dumb that Wyoming has the same power in the Senate as California. 50 times the population, the 8th or 9th largest economy in the world, and Wyoming is equal in power.\n\nIf I remember AMPC correctly, Sabato also introduces some very important hurdles to increasing the number of seats in congress; Namely, that the larger the legislature the harder it is to get things done, purely from a physical standpoint. The larger the group, the harder it is to organize. \n\nAn interesting theory I've heard was to change Congressional districts so that they were independent of state boundaries; each Representative is in charge of an even 660,000, regardless of state boundaries, so instead of being say, the Wyoming First Congressional district which has ~570,000 constituents, it'd be, say, the Three-Hundred and Fourth Congressional District, which would include most of Wyoming and parts of Montana that has roughly 660,000 constituents.

The Monroe Doctrine basically said to European powers; \"no new colonies in the West,\" and nothing else. But the only reason it worked at all was that it was supported by the premier global superpower at the time, Britain. It was in Britain's interest to not allow central European powers to establish themselves in the New World. France had given up most of it's territorial possession in America by 1823, Spain and Portugal were also dissolving their Empire's, only the US and Great Britain had any major influence in the Americas and that's how Britain wanted to keep it. By supporting the US's claim to defend North and South America, Britain gained an ally against any other European power in the region.\n\nIn the current case with China, there is no such support. Not only does that support not exist, but any similar doctrine would be in direct opposition to the premier global superpower of today (the US). East Asia is not a collection of colonies that wish to secede from their respective empires; it's a collection of fiercely independent \nsovereign nations that have spent years, decades and sometimes centuries trying to buck the yolk of foreign rule. Nor is China the first colony to successfully win independence against the will of their mother empire; it's a longtime regional power with a proclivity for wars of expansion.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "#As a first time candidate, what questions should you be asking yourself?\n\n1: **\"What happens when I lose?\"**\n\nCandidates rarely win their first federal campaign. While it's healthy for a campaign for the candidate to be assured of their rightness, realistically any campaigning this early in a candidate's career is largely to establish name recognition, and not to win seats. When campaigning, always consider the long game, not just the immediate election.\n\n\n2: **\"By running, do I hurt my cause, or advance it?\"**\n\nIt sounds like you already are aware of this question, just by the fact that you've dropped out of the primary to avoid a destructive race. Too many household-name politicians have ran without asking themselves this question usually causing problems for their platform. Look back to the 2012 Republican Presidential Primary, there were too many candidates for too few positions; could you realistically tell the differences in policy positions from Michelle Bachmann and Rick Santorum? Probably not. \n\n3: **\"Will I have a better chance next cycle?\"**\n\nNot all elections are created equal, some are easier than others. Some of the main things to consider, would you be running against an incumbent? Incumbents are very hard to beat in general elections. Would you be succeed a member of your own party? If the incumbent is from your party and is retiring, it will be almost always easier for you to keep that seat in the same party. Are the demographics in my district changing? A growing immigrant population, a large retirement community or even a large factory closing can heavily influence the voting characteristics of a district. These changes are not hard to predict, and may play to your advantage better next cycle, as opposed to this one. \n\n4: **\"Will I have the money to run twice?\"**\n\nA big part of any campaign is fundraising. But your first campaign is different; you must build a sizable network of donors to keep you political ambitions alive. If you've been tapped by a campaign committee of either major party, even better. The network of campaign donors is your most important asset as a candidate, even between elections. Like a muscle, it will atrophy without use. Always keep even the smallest donors informed and solicit feedback whenever possible. But manage those contributions carefully! If your first campaign runs out of money, what you're saying to your supporters was that they were wrong to support you. If you can't manage a campaign, how can you manage an elected office?\n\n5: **\"Do I want to run?\"**\n\nRunning for office is more work than a full time job. Seven day weeks, Eighteen-plus hours days. For the handful of months before an election, campaigning isn't your job, it's your whole life. Not many people can make that kind of a commitment, either physically, mentally or financially, so you have to know if you are one of them. You have to want it. And you have to show other people that you want it. Sure, it might be nice to be a lawmaker, voting on issues with John Boehner, filibustering with Wendy Davis, scheming with [Frank Underwood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cards_%28U.S._TV_series%29) or defending your principles with [Mr. Smith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Smith_Goes_to_Washington), but they earned the privilege to do those things with their time and effort, and many people don't realize that.", "id": "t1_cdngqxn", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "AnInfiniteAmount", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1rhlsb", "score": 5, "retrieved_on": 1428500333, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1rhlsb", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdngqxn", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1385483859", "ups": 5, "distinguished": null}

Unlike the other big two political networks, it just didn't present a narrative, it didn't cater to one side or the other. \n\nYou have to remember, CNN's big draw in the nineties was not it's commentary, it was the fact that they covered all sorts of events Live. They had reporters in Baghdad during both the Persian Gulf War, and Strike on Iraq in 1998; they were the only network with Live footage of many notable events, such as the Challenger disaster and the opening strikes on Kosovo. \n\nBut then what happened was 9/11, though it wasn't thought of at the time, it was the single biggest rating day for every news network in the history of television news. All of a sudden, every network was cutting to even the least noteworthy of \"Happening Now\" events from the Pope passing (devoting hours to reporting it Live doesn't make him less dead), to murder trials. Anything that could be reported first *had* to be reported first, by any network. Suddenly, CNN had no unique selling point.\n\nSo what happened was the rise of CNN's talking head shows, like *Crossfire*, *Capital Gang*, and *Inside Politics*, that became the center point of CNN's ratings, even though they were largely divested from reality and were only there as ratings sinks. What changed was, in 2005, *Crossfire* made the mistake of having Jon Stewart as a guest, and it caused both the cancellation of *Crossfire*, which in turn caused a large shake up in CNN's lineup. \n\nIn the past eight years, CNN has returned to relatively fact based reporting, such as *Situation Room*, *Erin Burnett OutFront*, and *Anderson Cooper 360*, plus the unavoidable \"what does that mean for you\" analysis, over the straight opinion-based analysis that MSNBC and Fox News fill their Primetime slots up with, which has hurt it's ratings (CNN consistently scores third of the Big Three news networks).\n\nModern CNN is more like a watchable newspaper than either of it's two competitors, which is why it seems moderate (Well, with the exception of Piers Morgan, who everyone thinks is an asshat).", "id": "t1_ccf39kp", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "AnInfiniteAmount", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1n3mk9", "selftext": "&gt;Piers Morgan, who is an asshat\n\n\nFTFY\n\n\nBut that's a good write up.

Likewise with \"counter-terrorism\". I don't disagree with the substance of your claim. I'm in disagreement with how you're framing this. By saying stuff like \"what governments do to their citizens is a secondary concern\", you're suggesting that it's anywhere near the wholly self-serving primary concern. It's orders of magnitude smaller. US government officials obviously aren't gratuitously sociopathic and every leader likes to cloak himself in humanitarian garb from time to time, but that's about it.\n\nAnyway, the main point of my previous comment was that policy makers don't actually care whether Egypt is mildly or moderately oppressive because of islamist rule. Killing apostates wasn't the law in Egypt and there is no reason to assume that it automatically will be in a formally democratic Egypt. So, why you bring this into the discussion is beyond me.\n\n\n&gt; Many of the main disputes in the country now are between the ruling religious conservatives and liberal secularists over things like how Turkish airline hostesses should be dressed and the ban on headscarves.\n\nWell, the headscarves are indeed a point of contention, but there's are far more serious issues than the air hostess thing. Like the fact that there is no press freedom in Turkey. There's no country in the world that jails more journalists. That's simply surreal in a country that has had a very strong civil society since forever.\n\n&gt; I can't think of any other military coup examples in recent history, although I'm sure there have been some.\n\nHaiti, but that's more of a Bush jr. and Clinton saga. Also, Venezuela.\n\nAnyway, the American reaction to the Honduran coup stands in rather stark contrast to the unconditional and total condemnation of both the EU and the organization of latin american states.

Many of the main disputes in the country now are between the ruling religious conservatives and liberal secularists over things like how Turkish airline hostesses should be dressed and the ban on headscarves.\n\nThe Muslim world's opinions on things like death for apostates [varies wildly from place to place](http://www.volokh.com/2013/05/02/around-the-world-muslims-heralded-religious-freedom/). Let's talk about those numbers:\n\n&gt; For instance, in South Asia, death for apostates is favored by 79% of Afghan Muslims, 75% of Pakistani Muslims, and 43% of Bangladeshi Muslims. In the Middle East and North Africa, the numbers were 88% in Egypt, 83% in Jordan, 62% in the Palestinian Territories, 41% in Iraq, 18% in Tunisia, and 17% in Lebanon.\n\n&gt; Support for the death penalty for apostates is 12% or lower in Southeastern European countries, Central Asian countries (1% in Azerbaijan, for instance), and Turkey. Likewise, 16% of Indonesian Muslims support the death penalty for apostates, while 58% of Malaysian Muslims do; and I noted above the Lebanon/Jordan gulf and Egypt/Tunisia\n\nObviously there are big differences from nation to nation. If 85% of your country favors killing people who leave Islam, then it goes without saying that letting them vote that policy into effect is a bad idea. Those Muslim nations are going to have a hard time with liberal democracy.\n\n&gt;American policy makers don't really care all that much about what sort of show people run inside their own borders. \n\nI would mostly agree with this actually. The number one concern of American policy makers is regional stability. They don't want any conflicts with Israel and they want the oil to keep running. Trying to depose the Saudis would of course destabilize the region and send oil prices through the ceiling. \n\nI should also note that while the Saudi government is rather extremist, they have helped suppress other religious extremists. The obvious example is Bin Laden, who was expelled by and hated the Saudi government. This kind of cooperation endears them to US administrations.\n\nThat said, I think that Obama administration does indeed care about what governments do to their citizens. It's just a secondary concern, after stability and counter-terrorism. Not a primary one.\n\n&gt; under Obama the Honduran military deposed and exiled the democratically elected president.\n\nMy understanding is that was more complicated than you make it out to be. The President there was popular, but had reached his term limits. He tried to run again anyway and the military deposed him. And it isn't as though American policy makers did nothing:\n\n&gt;The United States Department of State condemned the ouster of Zelaya and continued to recognize him as the only constitutional president of Honduras. ... U.S. officials characterized the events as a coup, suspended joint military operations on 1 July, suspended all non-emergency, non-immigrant visas, and cut off certain non-humanitarian aid to Honduras...\n\nI can't think of any other military coup examples in recent history, although I'm sure there have been some.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1hpa5h", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cawop97", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1373065902", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cawlbdh", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430571336, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; Islamic democracies often have a hard time with concepts of individual liberty:\n\nWhat Islamic democracies? To illustrate your point, you cite some statistic about Egyptian public opinion. Egypt still isn't a democracy, so it's not a serious point.
