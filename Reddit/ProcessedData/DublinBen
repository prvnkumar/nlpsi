They blocked the rule of law by ignoring court orders and publicly defaming judges. They put the Constitutional Court under siege, legislated a constitutionally illegitimate parliament, embarked on a large-scale campaign to tear down all national institutions and attempted to Islamise every aspect of society.\n\n&gt;They have abused the legitimacy of the ballot box to hijack the country and decided to write a new constitution that all liberals, Christians and mainstream thinkers refused to take part in.

The scene was reminiscent of how former president Hosni Mubarak once attempted to shut everything down in the 2010 parliamentary elections. Only this time, the Brotherhood had a thin mandate on hand; a mandate that was unfortunately unable to withstand the storm.\n\n[Another Egyptian, in regards to the 'silent majority' that turned against Morsi](http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/07/02/a-not-so-silent-majority/):   \n&gt;This is the majority that was hit by power outages, gas queues, inflation, and an unprecedented rise in prices of basic foods.

As it is, however, I have no idea how Mainwaring defined \"breakdowns,\" nor whether they made a distinction between parliamentary systems and presidential systems, nor any indication as to whether the breakdown was a bad thing, nor any other confounding factors (if, for example, certain nations were more prone to breakdown than others)\n\n&gt; Major parties must still win elections.

There's a \"strikingly clear line dividing the PR parliamentary systems from the plurality and majority systems\" (Lijphart 1999, p. 163).\n\nI think you're confused here.  The political center of mass isn't going to change if there are more parties. It's just not.  The centrist parties are *still* going to have more people voting for them than the extremists, the only difference is that with multiple parties, the centrist politicians have the option of which extreme to lean towards, as opposed to having that chosen for them, and wrongly, according to your own table...\n\n&gt; This is no different than what happens in a two-party system consisting of two super parties, each made up of different caucuses and factions.\n\nWait, I'm sorry, is it no different, or worse?

The Iraqi situation is weird because the fact that three groups of people are guaranteed representation (to protect the Kurdish minority) has arguably contributed to MORE sectarian violence that we see in that country.  So can we say that the Iraqi multi-party system is structured to protect the minorities' interests?  It's a tough sell, even if the three principle population groups have effective veto power on any given piece of legislation.\n\nMy argument is that the potential for abuse in multiparty systems is directly related to how diverse the population is within the group that we're talking about.  If we're talking about mostly homogenous societies, multi-party systems likely aren't going to be any more prone to abusing minorities than a two-party system.  But in cases where there are large groups of sharply defined minority groups, we can probably expect there to be some level of abuse in any democracy, most especially multi-party systems where coalition-based governance requires in most cases only a 50%+1 majority to form a government and therefore determine policy and priorities.\n\nI'm guessing that you'd want to know what would happen, in a thought experiment, if we changed the US model from the two-party, first-past-the-post style of representation to more of a representational democracy with no changes made to the structure of government in the form of the protections that I was talking about with filibuster rules, constitutional changes, etc.\n\nAssuming that we agree to such an interesting change in electoral rules, my first guess is that even less would get done than gets done now.  Just the introduction of the Tea Party members of the House totally changed the dynamic of how business got done in Washington (in that, it slowed dramatically from the years prior).  Ted Cruz' election to the Senate seems to be the primary reason that Chuck Hagel's nomination is being filibustered.  Even though they are not technically a separate party, I think the Tea Party's existence demonstrates the fragility of compromise in our national government when we introduce even ONE more significant voice onto the scene.  In a multiparty system with even more parties, there would probably be more voices clamoring for attention, less control over law making, and very likely, lots more secret deals made under shifty circumstances since no one knows what the hell is going on anyway.  I do not think it would be the rosy \"more representative\" outlook that you think it would become just by virtue of there being more voices.\n\nAnd really, it is this final point that opens the door of further abuse: without guaranteed transparency, the potential for abuse increases.  With more confusion in a system, potential for abuse increases because there is less easily accessible knowledge of what is going on.

As I noted above, a multi-party system can be more prone to abusing minorities, by lacking structural protections for minorities compared to two-party systems (which are, as you right noted, coalition-based). These fears get seen played out in real time in the case of Iraq, which has a multi-party system practically built into the constitution (where, by law, there must be representatives in government at the Vice-presidential level of the Kurds, the Arab Shi'ite and Arab Sunni populations).  Because the government is structured around population demographics, and veto power is granted on those demographics, Iraq has been noted as being one of the least functional existing governments in existence.\n\nWhich gets me to a central problem of discussions about multi-party democracies versus two-party systems or whatnot: the dangers of democracy exist in all its forms.  The rule of the many is necessarily a risky proposition to the few--and not just elite classes.  A multiparty system does NOT guarantee that the few will be protected; it merely provides them with nominal representation if they are many enough to be able to meet the requirements of whatever nation they exist within.  In mostly homogenous societies like Sweden, there aren't so many different \"Few\" groups to be concerned so they can generally get represented within a multi-party system and have relatively little fear of abuse.  However, in countries as wildly diverse as the United States or even Iraq, multi-party systems can have the potential for even more sharp abuse than exists in our current system.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8gynms", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361152837", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c8fkopj", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431300589, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Good points all around, but I feel like \n\n&gt; Two party systems are also more moderate, and two parties will tend to fight over centrist voters, rather than extremist voters.\n\nis a negative rather than a positive.

Your argument rests on a mistaken view on consistency. You think that just because we made one choice about alcohol, allowing it, we have to make a similar choice about heroin. But we didn't make a choice about alcohol thinking that it was good for people or that the harm was OK because of the benefits or anything like that. We never really made a choice in favor of alcohol, we resigned ourselves to it. We don't try to stop it now because we know we can't. But that doesn't mean we can't stop other things. \n\nIf you had an untreatable disease would you not treat the cancer you got on top of that because it would be inconsistent to treat one disease but not the other?

Moreover the Portugal situation involves people receiving free but mandatory psychological counselling. Try getting that going in America. And nothing I said admits what you seem to think it does. There is, of course, more use of marijuana than heroin because of the lethality of heroin, but that is no admission that use of harder drugs won't increase with legalization. Of course they will. Will there be a giant surge of use? I'm not sure how much of an increase there will be, but there will be one. More people will die.

Your argument rests on a mistaken view on consistency. You think that just because we made one choice about alcohol, allowing it, we have to make a similar choice about heroin. But we didn't make a choice about alcohol thinking that it was good for people or that the harm was OK because of the benefits or anything like that. We never really made a choice in favor of alcohol, we resigned ourselves to it. We don't try to stop it now because we know we can't. But that doesn't mean we can't stop other things. \n\nIf you had an untreatable disease would you not treat the cancer you got on top of that because it would be inconsistent to treat one disease but not the other?

Moreover the Portugal situation involves people receiving free but mandatory psychological counselling. Try getting that going in America. And nothing I said admits what you seem to think it does. There is, of course, more use of marijuana than heroin because of the lethality of heroin, but that is no admission that use of harder drugs won't increase with legalization. Of course they will. Will there be a giant surge of use? I'm not sure how much of an increase there will be, but there will be one. More people will die.

And higher wages for the middle class spur more production as those workers take their higher wages and go out and spend the money, thereby increasing the pay or number of jobs for other workers in the economy. Whereas the CEO often spends a lower percentage of his income than the middle or lower class employees and occasionally takes his pay out of the economy completely by taking it off-shore. Therefore, given a fixed amount of money, you're better off having lower CEO pay and higher worker pay if you want to spur production in the economy.

It is often not that they \"can't\" hire as many owrkers at that price, it is that they \"won't\". And sometimes the \"won't\" is \"won't because the CEO needs a new parachute worth another million.\" \n\nThis idea that workers should sacrifice their level of pay until the employer is happy is what causes the race to the bottom we are presently experiencing in America. In fact there is an article up in r/politics about who the new norm for Americans is low wage and temporary jobs with no benefits and no future. Unions are a bulwark against that kind of thing. Notice the increase of these kids of jobs throughout the American economy at the same time as union rolls have been on a gradual decline.\n\nLastly, the situation you imagine only applies to certain jobs. There are many jobs for which the number of employees needed is static. Within a narrow range you either have enough people to do the job or you don't and once you do you need no more. So if building a car requires 10 people (as a made up example) then no matter how cheaply those people offer to work you're not going to hire guy 11. He would have nothing to do. So in cases like those, lowering wages only increases CEO/shareholder pay.

I am just up early (for me) to check on a computer thing so I am going to answer your well written response in two pieces. The part I wanted to comment on first is the cost argument. Paradoxically, a great amount of research says that we would spend much less (even on a per-person basis) under single payer than under the current system. There are a number of reasons.. One of the main reason is catching illnesses earlier and being able to apply inexpensive fixes by providing appropriate care without the inevitable delay that comes from user fees making the problems much larger before they are addressed. That has been shown to save a lot of money. Google Rand study of healthcare utilization. Also the Canadian government has a web page whose URL I have to find for you in a bit that gathers together all the studies. Also, a great many studies consistently tell us this, very highly regarded studies by world class medical organizations.

Generating revenue by essentially imposing a tax on illness is not good policy. If the goal is to ensure better use of health services, finding and eliminating inefficiencies across the continuum of care holds much more promise.\n\n    Tags: Healthcare financing Public/private mix \n\nTough economic times stir up anxiety over the affordability of public services\u2014especially healthcare. As governments struggle to balance budgets, and healthcare spending continues to grow faster than the economy, conditions are ripe for old\u2014and often discredited\u2014policy ideas to make a comeback. User fees are no exception. At first blush, user fees appear to be an obvious solution. After all, any policy that promises to generate revenue[1] and reduce costs by deterring unnecessary use is hard to ignore.[1,2]  But as research has shown over the years, the silver bullet of user fees really is the stuff of fantasy.[3]\n\nThe evidence indicates that implementing a medical toll booth to reduce healthcare traffic along a particular route can obstruct access to needed care, especially for those that are poor.[4]  Viewing patients as responsible for the high costs of healthcare ignores the evidence against user fees and the opportunities for greater efficiency that can be found along the continuum of care.[5]  A medical toll booth simply won\u2019t do the trick.\n\nThe Tangle of Necessary and Unnecessary Care\n\nThe RAND Health Insurance Experiment, the largest and most rigorous study of user fees to date, found that the more patients had to pay for care, the less they used it.[6,7]  Less care led to lower costs, but it didn\u2019t mean greater efficiency, because sometimes people received fewer services when they actually needed more. Patients did reduce their use of less-effective care, but there was a decrease in the use of effective care as well.[7]  The RAND findings also showed that the proportion of inappropriate hospital stays and admissions was the same with or without user fees.[8]\n\nThe RAND findings have stood the test of time. In one study, user fees lowered the appropriate use of effective prevention services and medications to help manage chronic diseases.[4]  User fees have also been shown to reduce inappropriate as well as appropriate antibiotic use to a similar extent.[9]\n\nSavings At Any Cost\n\n\nIn Canada, user fees were introduced in Saskatchewan in the sixties and seventies. Subsequent research found that they reduced the annual use of physician services by almost 6%. Notably, low-income families reduced their use of physician services by about 18%.[10]  Saskatchewan's overall healthcare costs, however, did not go down. Indeed, over the period user fees were levied, physician fees increased and high income earners on average increased their use of physician services.[11]\n\n\nUser fees may also cause some people to forego necessary treatment. In Quebec, for instance, when the elderly and people on welfare had to pay user fees for prescription drugs, they took less medicine and their conditions worsened. **As a result, they ended up with more visits to emergency departments and an increase in serious adverse events.[12]**\n\n\n**A study of seniors insured through U.S. Medicare found that raising user fees for physician visits and prescriptions increased Medicare costs.[13]  As in Quebec, many patients stopped taking their medications and ended up in the hospital.** These findings are supported by a 2007 systematic review of prescription drug cost-sharing.[14] Researchers found that although it is not certain that user fees lead to negative outcomes for all patients, their effect on the chronically ill was clear: increased emergency department use and hospitalizations.[14]\n\nWho Pays the Price\n\n\nThe Canada Health Act effectively bans user fees for two main health services: hospitals and physicians.[15]  There are good reasons for this. User fees shift costs to those that use the system the most: sick people. This amounts to a tax on poverty and age, since the poor and the elderly are less healthy than other groups.[15,16,17,18]\n\n\nThe poor are especially sensitive to these fees, which have led to policies that exempt them from user charges. A 2010 report examining the possibility of a health deductible in Quebec suggested that such an exemption would thwart much of the revenue-generating potential of user fees.[19]  Because healthcare utilization tends to be concentrated among low-income Canadians, low-income exemptions would significantly reduce the proportion of patients paying user fees.[19]\n\n\nThe poor are negatively affected by user fees in other ways, too. A study looking at the effects of prescription drug user fees found that low-income patients were more likely to stop taking medications to treat chronic disease.[20]  These results are not surprising, as in the RAND study adverse health effects due to a decline in care were concentrated among low-income families.[21,7]\n\nUser fees are a blunt instrument for targeting waste. They are aimed exclusively at patients, but patients have very little control over which medical services they use.[11,22]  Patients choose whether or not to visit a doctor, but ongoing care and big-ticket items are ordered by physicians, the \u201cgatekeepers\u201d of the healthcare system.[23,11,22]  What\u2019s more, physician fees account for only 14% of healthcare expenditures.[24]  Patients are not solely responsible for the high costs of healthcare,[3] so it doesn\u2019t make sense to put cost containment on their shoulders.\nConclusion\n\nWhile user fees are effectively banned for hospitals and family physicians in Canada, we continue to have them for many other aspects of healthcare.[25]  \n\nIf our goal is to ensure better use of health services, the evidence shows that user fees have not been capable of achieving it. Finding and eliminating inefficiencies across the continuum of care holds much more promise. The shift toward integrated and coordinated care delivery systems is encouraging, especially where they have been designed to meet the needs of specific populations.[26]  That said, efforts to integrate healthcare services continue to be frustrated by user fees (routinely required for visits to physiotherapists, psychologists and for home care support, etc.) that can create access barriers to the most appropriate services.\nReferences\n\n1.

Our hyper tiered system is not only providing very low quality healthcare to the poor and those in HMOs which seems to be continually declining in quality relative to other nations. Its also causing healthcare for the wealthy to decline in quality as a result of the impossibility of maintaining two separate levels of healthcare in a manner that does not expose medical professionals to liability. Perhaps partly because their business model (and the huge waste which our system creates) also creates a situation where the choice for providers of healthcare services is to either go to a situation with segregation just like that in the old South. Lets call that the two waiting room scenario.. Or dumb down the care for everybody..Say in the past an imaging provider would provide more information to their self pay and fee for service insurance clients, but would just provide a binary 1 or 0 kind of data to the HMO clients.. They only can do this if they keep the clients separated..\n\nBut that is really expensive and there is still the risk that by providing high quality care to the wealthy, who often self pay, they will be called to task for not providing it to the merely \"insured\". *So, many providers, faced with pressure by HMOS to diagnose less illness, or give up business to other providers, increasingly are lowering the standard of care for everybody!* Or so I've heard many times.\n\nHave a nice weekend!", "id": "t1_c7nhz8e", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c7nhv83", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430794467, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1356734454, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_15iz8v", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7nhz8e", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1356733767", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c7nrpwa", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "riverctconservative", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c7nhv83", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430799135, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Found something:\n\nwww.forbes.com/sites/howardgleckman/2012/12/26/the-promise-and-risks-of-medicare-managed-care/\n\nLooks like Medicare is doing the research as we speak.

Health care, even under single payer, would be funded by federal income taxes so I have a hard time seeing one crowd out the other. Another counter-argument I would make is that even under the scenario you paint, I wonder how many (and what power they possess) business leaders have the view you have illustrated? Most business in the US is still small business and those leaders do not think on the scale you are talking about. They have kids and grandkids as well and it seems to me they would work to make the current system better rather than turn it over to an untested new system. I see the big picture you are painting, I just have a hard time connecting the individual dots. It would make more sense to me that Conservative minded folks would resist the concentration of power you are granting to big business and would ultimately oppose the scenario you illustrate.\n \nRegarding health care, yes cost is the big problem. Conservatives see single payer as ultimately making costs greater. The more we attempt to insulate the individual from the costs of consuming health care, the more they will consume. In the end, we all pay more and the costs are getting unsustainable. But there still is a very ambiguous link (to the individual) between the choices we make and the associated costs. I am a huge fan of high deductible plans and HSAs. They brought consumer choice back into the equation. They drove better conversations with our doctor regarding the value of certain tests, imaging, etc. Ultimately the best way to lower health care costs is to have a healthier population and a better way to medically manage the end of our lives.
