They are both (or will be, should the Eurasian Union be established) common markets with aspects of a growing political union. \n\nIf both unions allow for the free movement of capital, labor, and commodities you quickly see why simultaneous membership would be ruled out: Ukraine would become a back door into the European Union from Eurasian Union citizens and visa versa. (E.g. by way of simplification: European Union citizen from Spain moves freely to Ukraine, and then uses their status as a Ukrainian resident to move to Russia.)\n\nPolitical and monetary aspects raise similar issues. Who would be the governing body? The European Parliament in Brussels? Or the Eurasian Parliament (if such a system would be adopted, though I doubt Russia would be so democratic) in Moscow? Which currency would they use? The Euro, or the Eurasian Dollar? \n\nTrade disputes would also erupt: goods from EU countries able to move freely into Ukraine could avoid any import tariffs or quotas established by Eurasian Union countries. Not to mention the fact that the Regional Trade Agreements established by each would likely put some restriction on member country's abilities to enter individual agreements with non-member countries (otherwise the Unions would be placing their common markets at risk).\n\nAt the end of the day you can think of it as joining two different sport teams within the same league. Whose coach do you listen to? Which training regimen do you follow? Which team do you play for when both go head to head? There's a clear conflict of interest, because it would be very difficult to benefit one without hurting the other. \n\nThe Ukraine is wise to wait on associating with the EU. It is highly unlikely for any Union established by Russia could survive without Ukraine.\n\nJoining the Eurasian Union would increase the customs union currently comprised of Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan from a market of ~165 million to ~210 million. The Ukraine is also the most culturally significant Commonwealth of Independent States member as far as Russia is concerned. This desire for Ukraine by Russia combined with the fact that Ukraine is currently heavily in debt means Ukraine can likely leverage it's position to wring quite a few concessions out of Moscow by flirting with the idea of European Union association and membership: money to repay $8 billion in Ukrainian debt that comes due next year, cheaper oil and gas prices through preferred trade agreements (both Kazakhstan and Russia are producers), the removal of the threat of trade restrictions from Russia, and the political clout that comes along with being such a vital interest in Russian affairs. On a less quantitative note, the two countries are also much similar to one another with regards to standards, socialization, and political processes than are Ukraine and the average EU state. \n\nBut I'm straying quite far from your original question now. Back to the point: The Treaties of Rome that established the European Economic Community, with which Ukraine recently declined (at least temporarily) to affiliate itself, prohibits restrictive agreements and state aids which can affect trade between member states or aims to prevent, restrict or distort competition. Thus, while it does not explicitly state that member states cannot enter independent trade agreements, it is understood that thee agreements must meet certain criteria to be accepted as a member of the European Union and its common market, Eurozone, etc. \n\nSo. After much delay and rambling by myself, I hope it's clear as to why the free movement of labor, capital, and commodities from two separate unions with a single shared member state would be all but impossible in any practical sense. \n\n*NOTE: please forgive any typos or erroneous autocorrects.

Why do I think this?

Not only that, but immigration lowers wages of those workers employed in the lowest paid jobs, and it also leads to heavy youth unemployment.\n\nThis is another fair point, though I'm not sure how many kitchens or orchards were unionized. Agricultural work and migrant farming has been the job of immigrant labor for a long, long time in the US. It's unfair to say that illegal immigrants are the sole purpose for the weakened position trade unions within the US; corporations, local governments, and voters have varying degrees of responsibility as well. They do play a role in weakening unions and lowering wages, however, so any reform should not fail to address this.\n\n&gt;I'm pretty left wing, and I believe we should strongly enforce our borders, crack down on illegal immigrants, and select the most educated immigrants to come here. Why is this not a left wing idea?\n\nPolitics. Your ideas make sense, but it also clashes with the conventional wisdom of what it means to identify as a liberal. The Democratic Party also knows that they can consistently rely on the minority vote, in most cases, when it comes to be election time. Unfortunately, this leads to expanding social programs which ameliorate suffering but don't aim at the root of the problem. Liberals in the US know that if they increase the minimum wage, promise inclusive immigration legislation, and expand other programs that otherwise wouldn't be available to illegal immigrants they'll be securing a generation of party loyalists. If they were to try to get to the root of the problem they'd have to take a harsher stance, which would prove unpopular. It would also disallow them the ability to contrast themselves with the Republicans (who seem to be struggling with just about everything these days).\n\nObviously, there are facets of your post that politicians have proposed many times over. Gaining enough support for them, or marketing them in the correct way as to make them sound benevolent rather than threatening, is a different issue altogether. \n\nEDIT: I just reread your last point. I disagree with your opinion that \"ethically diverse\" workplaces are somehow less productive or somehow produce \"weak\" unions. I'd like to see any data you have that backs up that claim. I live in NYC, so maybe I'm biased, but I don't think anything would get done if people from different ethnic backgrounds couldn't manage to work together.", "id": "t1_cbnz34f", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Impune", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ke126", "id": "t1_cbnzhlk", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;Sweden and Norway do not have very open immigration policies, except as they pertain to asylum seekers.\n\nI'm less familiar with Norway, but Sweden has a relatively open immigration policy.

Since they formed the majority government and took the presidency in 2007, the [Justice and Development Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_and_Development_Party_(Turkey) (AKP) has become increasingly authoritarian. The violent police reaction to demonstrators in the park was just the straw that broke the camel's back. \n\nThe AKP silenced many members of the secular intellegista community (including artists) for \"instulting relgion\", which curtailed freedom of speech in both the media (jailing thousands of journalists) and academic circles. The government also increased the power of the (traditionally pro-Islamic) police while stunting the (tratidionally pro-secular) military through [Balyoz trials](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sledgehammer_(coup_plan)).\n\nThe AKP also increased the scope and assistance to religious education (which was formally banned in Turkey under Ataturk), imposed restrictions on the consumption of alcohol, revoked the permissibility of abortions after the first week of conception, mandated that every theatre, opera house, and university construct a mosque on their premises, and had the words \"Turkish Republic\" stripped from all public buildings. \n\nIn short: Erdogan has worn out his welcome. His party was widely supported in the earlier years, especially as Turkey saw impressive economic growth under the regime. AKP also promoted peace talks with the [Kurdish Workers' Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Workers'_Party) (PKK), a militarist Kurdish separatist group that engaged in violence within the state for many years. But as the AKP gained in power Erdogan became less sensitive to the will of the people and began to act more like a tone-deaf oppressor. People are simply sick and tired of not being listened to, of being walked over, of being ignored. There are political games afoot as well, with [Kemalist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemalism) rivals of Erdogan and the AKP fanning the flames in the hope that his party will crumble, clearing the way for their ascension.

It's explicitly sanctioned in the first amendment \"to petition the Government for a redress of grievances\". It is a form of free speech and is the right to talk with you representative. Banning lobbyism would mean that literally no one is allowed to talk to legislators about legislation, meaning our legislators would simply have no idea what they would be voting on. But on another note, let's look at two scenarios:\n\n1. You have a benevolent legislator, he refuses bribes and acts in the interests of his constituents. Being a good legislator, he doesn't vote on bills without being informed, so he tries to learn about the bills that are coming in. He has to learn about hundreds of bills and thus cant really go in-depth or cover very many of them, he concludes that he needs to get briefs on legislation and talk to experts. Unfortunately, with a lack of staffers, he is **forced** to rely on other sources to be educated.

Or a business can simply lobby with misleading information. The legislator, **even a perfect one acting out of completely benevolent interests**, has been colored by big-business and will now make decisions based on the information those businesses have given him. \n\n2. A legislator is corrupt and is willing to take bribes or other contributions. In which case there is nothing that can really be done to fix him, because he already is motivated to use his position to make money. Banning lobbying doesnt solve the problem at all. Backdoor bribery and corruption is still very possible. Even **completely non-traceable** forms of corruption and malice are possible. Let's say a congressman doesn't think he will win reelection or simply desires to retire. Demand for former congressmen to work for businesses is extremely high, because they know the ins and outs of Washington and can abuse their former position. The congressman wants to work for a major oil company, so during his term in office he pushes and supports major subsidies and tax breaks that favor that oil company or even directly contracts them. This way his chance of getting a job there is higher after his term ends. \n\nIn both of these scenarios lobbyism is not the problem. You seem to think that many of our legislators are corrupt and thus under the second scenario it is **IMPOSSIBLE** to stop them, even if lobbying was banned. In the first scenario, even with a completely benevolent congressman, lobbying isnt the problem, it's the fact that there are no staffers and that business lobbies can outspend the other lobbies. \n\nLobbying as a problem is a **critical misdirection** that prevents us from addressing the **real** problems, big business, a critically understaffed congress, and corruption.\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Chipzzz", "id": "t1_c9okpyw", "parent_id": "t1_c9oir0x", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431391407, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thank you for the thoughtful thorough response, and that was quite a nimble slight of mind in substituting \"persuasion\" for \"money\" and bringing us only a hairbreadth from \"speech\".

Unfortunately, with a lack of staffers, he is forced to rely on other sources to be educated. Businesses and lobbying firms outspend the other public-interest groups (they can simply afford more trips to Washington) and get more time to spend with the legislator. The business lobbyists teach the legislator about various policies, using reliable information, however information isnt always clear-cut and the business will usually relay information that is favorable to them. Or a business can simply lobby with misleading information. The legislator, even a perfect one acting out of completely benevolent interests, has been colored by big-business and will now make decisions based on the information those businesses have given him.\n\nThis is quite the rosy depiction of a common scenario. It isn't, however, the reality.

The bottom line is that the vast majority of lobbyists blur the line between ethical and unethical and create conflicts of interests.

We need staffers, public offices, and equal lobbyism to inform congress. \n\nI am not advocating unleashing the lobbyists, but I am saying that lobbyists are inherently not the problem, but rather an abuse of lobbyism. \n\nEven if legislators wrote everything in the bills, you would still have massive disparities in information in a system where there are no lobbyists or staffers. Say a congressman has a background in an obscure field in science, he authors a bill to authorize creation of more scientific equipment for that field. Odds are, no one else in the congress will be able to make an informed decision if there are no experts, lobbyists, or staffers brought in.

USA! while you write.\n\nOy vey. Talk about rhetoric... But I guess you Googled a few Wikipedia pages. You must know what you're talking about.\n\n&gt;The US spending on defence is 700 billion a year. So tell me again how spending on the UN is why the US spends so much more?\n\nI wasn't implying that the UN or NATO funding was the only reason why the US defense budget is so large. I was using them as examples of how the US supplements the rest of the world's defense spending. Aside from the UN and NATO, the US also spends billions of dollars training and equipping foreign troops.\n\nIn FY 2010 alone the US spent [nearly $7 billion *a month*](http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL33110.pdf) in Afghanistan training Afghan soldiers, building military infrastructure, housing, fuel, equipment, etc. About $50 billion has gone directly to equipping and training Afghan soldiers, which suggests there is something seriously amiss with your magical Wikipedia'd numbers of $50 billion for US Armed Forces equipment, total. (Unless you believe that the US is pouring 100% of its equipment budget into a foreign army, leaving its own soldiers without.)\n\n&gt;Here's your foreign military financing: 4.5 billion dollars.\n\nForeign Military Financing =/= military aid. The FMF program facilitates US arms deals with other nations, usually through grants and loans. Foreign military aid, on the other hand, is a term which envelopes FMF, IMET, and other less specific costs such as projects undertaken by the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs (which is technically overseen by the DoS, but whose projects are funded by the DoD).\n\n&gt;Countries you're actually spending most of your money on: The ones you're blowing up and Israel, not any part of Europe.\n\nIf you take a second to look, you'll notice that the DoD dedicates the largest portion of its budget (41%) to facility operations and maintenance. According to the [Base Structure Report (FY 2012)](http://www.acq.osd.mil/ie/download/bsr/BSR2012Baseline.pdf):\n\n&gt;The DoD manages a worldwide real property portfolio that spans all 50 states, seven U.S. territories, and 40 foreign countries. The majority of the foreign sites are located in Germany (232 sites), Japan (109 sites), and South Korea (85 sites).\n\nStrange. Japan and South Korea? I could have sworn I said the US subsidized their defense heavily before... And Germany? I'm just a jingoistic American so I can't be sure, but I'm 95% positive that's a country located somewhere in Europe. Since you might be struggling to understand what I'm saying, I'll try to make it even more clear:\n\nBases take a lot of dough to operate, maintain, staff, and supply. The majority of oversees bases are in Europe. (200+ in Germany, 30+ in Great Britain, 10+ in Portugal, 6 in Norway, and others...) All those European countries are members of NATO. The US gives the largest amount of money to peacekeeping forces of NATO, and also operates, maintains, and garrisons over 300 military facilities in Europe. If you're a European member state of NATO and have an ally with the most powerful military on the planet already hanging out in your backyard, chances are you don't need to spend much on defense (because if you were attacked, said ally with the bases and troops everywhere would be obligated to defend you).\n\n**TL;DR:** The US has a defense budget larger than the next 13 countries combined because those 13 other countries don't pay for all their friends' guns, like the US does.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c9n1sty", "parent_id": "t1_c9mwcku", "score": -4, "retrieved_on": 1431421666, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Right.

If you'd like to completely change your argument to \"we're paying a lot for the wars we started\" you go right ahead, but don't pretend proving that proves the argument you've been making all along. \n\nBases do take money and you're totally right about the 41% of the defense budget the US puts into that. You kind of leave out that your own document, the base structure report, shows that there are only 660 bases overseas but there are 4500 bases in the US. So the bases overseas make up, let's be generous to you, only 1/8 of total bases. So out of the 41% of the budget we're talking about (and assuming it is all spent on bases) there is only 1/8 of that being spent on overseas bases. So only about 5% of the total budget is spent on overseas bases. \n\n**If the US closed every single overseas base it would still spend more than the next 13 countries combined.**\n\n**TL;DR** Nice that you have some facts, but you're bad at math.  \n\nP.S.

Do you chant USA! USA! while you write.\n\nOy vey. Talk about rhetoric... But I guess you Googled a few Wikipedia pages. You must know what you're talking about.\n\n&gt;The US spending on defence is 700 billion a year. So tell me again how spending on the UN is why the US spends so much more?\n\nI wasn't implying that the UN or NATO funding was the only reason why the US defense budget is so large. I was using them as examples of how the US supplements the rest of the world's defense spending. Aside from the UN and NATO, the US also spends billions of dollars training and equipping foreign troops.\n\nIn FY 2010 alone the US spent [nearly $7 billion *a month*](http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL33110.pdf) in Afghanistan training Afghan soldiers, building military infrastructure, housing, fuel, equipment, etc. About $50 billion has gone directly to equipping and training Afghan soldiers, which suggests there is something seriously amiss with your magical Wikipedia'd numbers of $50 billion for US Armed Forces equipment, total. (Unless you believe that the US is pouring 100% of its equipment budget into a foreign army, leaving its own soldiers without.)\n\n&gt;Here's your foreign military financing: 4.5 billion dollars.\n\nForeign Military Financing =/= military aid. The FMF program facilitates US arms deals with other nations, usually through grants and loans. Foreign military aid, on the other hand, is a term which envelopes FMF, IMET, and other less specific costs such as projects undertaken by the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs (which is technically overseen by the DoS, but whose projects are funded by the DoD).\n\n&gt;Countries you're actually spending most of your money on: The ones you're blowing up and Israel, not any part of Europe.\n\nIf you take a second to look, you'll notice that the DoD dedicates the largest portion of its budget (41%) to facility operations and maintenance. According to the [Base Structure Report (FY 2012)](http://www.acq.osd.mil/ie/download/bsr/BSR2012Baseline.pdf):\n\n&gt;The DoD manages a worldwide real property portfolio that spans all 50 states, seven U.S. territories, and 40 foreign countries. The majority of the foreign sites are located in Germany (232 sites), Japan (109 sites), and South Korea (85 sites).\n\nStrange. Japan and South Korea? I could have sworn I said the US subsidized their defense heavily before... And Germany? I'm just a jingoistic American so I can't be sure, but I'm 95% positive that's a country located somewhere in Europe. Since you might be struggling to understand what I'm saying, I'll try to make it even more clear:\n\nBases take a lot of dough to operate, maintain, staff, and supply. The majority of oversees bases are in Europe. (200+ in Germany, 30+ in Great Britain, 10+ in Portugal, 6 in Norway, and others...) All those European countries are members of NATO. The US gives the largest amount of money to peacekeeping forces of NATO, and also operates, maintains, and garrisons over 300 military facilities in Europe. If you're a European member state of NATO and have an ally with the most powerful military on the planet already hanging out in your backyard, chances are you don't need to spend much on defense (because if you were attacked, said ally with the bases and troops everywhere would be obligated to defend you).\n\n**TL;DR:** The US has a defense budget larger than the next 13 countries combined because those 13 other countries don't pay for all their friends' guns, like the US does.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c9n1sty", "parent_id": "t1_c9mwcku", "score": -4, "retrieved_on": 1431421666, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Right. First it was Eastern Europe, then it was Europe, then it was Japan, then it was south Korea, then it was the UN and now it is.... Afghanistan? \n\nRebuilding countries you blew up, or blowing them up even more doesn't count as \"buying your friends guns\". It counts as nation building. And given that the article you site is from 2010 a lot of that is still **fighting**. If you'd like to completely change your argument to \"we're paying a lot for the wars we started\" you go right ahead, but don't pretend proving that proves the argument you've been making all along. \n\nBases do take money and you're totally right about the 41% of the defense budget the US puts into that. You kind of leave out that your own document, the base structure report, shows that there are only 660 bases overseas but there are 4500 bases in the US. So the bases overseas make up, let's be generous to you, only 1/8 of total bases. So out of the 41% of the budget we're talking about (and assuming it is all spent on bases) there is only 1/8 of that being spent on overseas bases. So only about 5% of the total budget is spent on overseas bases. \n\n**If the US closed every single overseas base it would still spend more than the next 13 countries combined.**\n\n**TL;DR** Nice that you have some facts, but you're bad at math.  \n\nP.S. The next country on the list, the one right after the US, is China. We're not supplying China with weapons or military cover. So it's not the next 13 countries we're covering for. \n\n", "edited": 1366982663, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1d3kwp", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9n1sty", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366981455", "distinguished": null, "ups": -4}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Impune", "id": "t1_c9mwcku", "parent_id": "t1_c9mt9s3", "score": 9, "retrieved_on": 1431424307, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9mwcku", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366950155", "distinguished": null, "ups": 9}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c9mt9s3", "parent_id": "t1_c9ms179", "score": -16, "retrieved_on": 1431425757, "controversiality": 0, "body": "My goodness, your jingoism and lack of evidence really make for some compelling posts.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1cw79h", "selftext": "Hey, OP. It seems like there's a lot of misperception about the US-lead invasion of Iraq. I'm a little surprised to see such uninformed responses in Ask_Politics, since this is generally a sub of more informed political discourse... but then again I guess I shouldn't assume everyone is well versed in international law. So. The US-lead invasion is illegal on numerous counts. Let's start on the domestic level to lend the situation some context.\n\n**Domestic illegality:**\n \n* [Article I, Section 8](http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_A1Sec8.html) of the US Constitution endows Congress, not the president, with the authority to declare war.\n\nSome point to the [War Powers Resolution](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-33) recognizes the constitutional powers of the president as Commander-in-Chief to engage US Armed Forces in hostile (or preemptive) maneuvers **if and only if**: (1) Congress has declared war, (2) there has been a specific statute which authorizes said military actions, or (3) there is an attack on the United States, its territorial holdings, or the Armed Forces. \n\nThe Bush Administration suggested that they had legitimacy in leading the \"collation of the willing\" into Iraq pursuant to [UN Security Council Resolution 678](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_678) (which authorized a UN collation to engage in the Gulf War, which targeted Iraq), and the [Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization_for_Use_of_Military_Force_Against_Terrorists) (AUMF) which was passed by Congress on September 14, 2001. This statute gave the President as Commander-in-Chief the authority to use appropriate military action against those *responsible for the terrorist attacks of 9/11*.\n\nNeither of these things, however, would be legal grounds for the President to circumvent Article I, Section 8 of the US Constitution. The Security Council resolution only authorized military action against Iraq so that Iraq would withdraw from Kuwait. It shouldn't take much explaining that the Congressional approval of military action against terrorists responsible for 9/11 does not authorize military action against those not responsible for the terrorist attacks, or those we suspect of having illegal arms (read: Saddam Hussein's oppressive regime).\n\n**International illegality:**\n\n* [Article 6, Clause 2](http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/tocs/a6_2.html) of the US Constitution stipulates that all treaties shall become the \"supreme law of the land.\" Meaning that when the US decided to become a signatory of the UN Charter, the Charter became the supreme law of the land in the US.\n\n* The UN Charter requires that all member states settle all international disputes peacefully and refrain from engaging in offensive military operations. The UN Charter gives the UN Security Council exclusive authority to use military force unless a member state is acting in self-defense. (The Charter also states that in cases of self-defense, the UN shall act as a collective to defend the non-aggressor member state.)\n\nIraq did violate certain UN resolutions, specifically Resolution 678 which mandated that Iraq cooperate with UN weapon inspectors. The Security Council also approved [Resolution 1154](http://www.un.org/Depts/unscom/Keyresolutions/sres98-1154.htm) which threatened that the UN would implement whatever measures would \"secure peace and security\" in the region should Iraq continue to thwart and ignore earlier resolutions. However, Iraq's violations of these resolutions is not license for the US-lead invasion.\n\nSpecifically, [Articles 41 and 42](http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml) of the UN Charter declare that no member state has the authority to enforce any resolution through military means unless: (1) the Security Council decides a nation has breached a resolution, (2) all non-military means of enforcement have been exhausted, and (3) said military action is specifically authorized by the UN Security Council (as they authorized force against Iraq in Resolution 789 for their invasion of Kuwait).\n\nThe Security Council did not authorize the use of military force against Iraq for any violations of resolutions since Resolution 789, which expired once the mandate of the resolution had been achieved (UN collation successfully drove Iraq out of Kuwait).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe US-lead invasion of Iraq was illegal on virtually every level: (1) the president did not have Congressional approval; (2) the president did not have authority pursuant to the War Powers Resolution because the US had not been attacked by Iraq; (3) the president lacked legitimacy pursuant to AUMF because Iraq was not involved in 9/11; (4) the UN Security Council did not authorize use of force by any member state against Iraq.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1cw79h", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Honest_Benjamin", "id": "t1_c9mogom", "parent_id": "t1_c9mdvvg", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431428094, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks for your answer!

In any case, I think the NRA has plenty of legitimacy from its base. It has around 5 million members; for reference, the ACLU has 500,000. 41% of Americans view the NRA in a positive light (and 34% in a negative light).

If that makes sense...\n\nIn my opinion, the gun control people have traditionally been the ones to escalate the issue. When was the last time a US congressman introduced a pro-gun law out of the blue? If I had to guess, I'd say the FOPA in 1986 (into which a senator inserted more gun control, in a way that broke the rules of the senate). Since then, we've had the Brady bill, 1994 AWB, expansions of the NICS system, and Feinstein's attempts to renew the AWB pretty much every year since 2004. Before that, we had bans on guns that are invisible to x-rays (which don't exist), bans on 'armor-piercing bullets' (which aren't necessarily armor piercing), the 1968 GCA, the 1934 NFA, and more. I don't think you can say that there's really a pro-gun paradigm in the federal government.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1ckqrt", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "FlyingSquirrelTyphus", "id": "t1_c9itcpg", "parent_id": "t1_c9i6su6", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431495062, "controversiality": 0, "body": "The NRA achieved legitimacy before their lobbying arm ever accomplished anything.

I am not discounting the power of the NRA, but I am arguing that their power derives from: A)their role as the primary gun safety, early gun education, and gun issues awareness group in America B)their success in advocating for pro-gun policies c)their ability to shift the gun debate through legal and political avenues d)many Americans like guns.\n\nI completely disagree about the escalation point. The NRA has been pushing legal test cases for years in an attempt to get the courts to create new precedent that favors wide open gun policy, which they do, which is met with increased gun control efforts to conform the laws to new cases. Heck, in GA, we had several very strong pro-gun bills come up during the legislature this year. I get that these aren't federal bills being introduced, but guns are addressed almost ever year by at least a couple state legislatures and often times it is expanding access or concealed carry locations. I think it is also important to point out that the Brady Bill, AWB, NICS, and the 1968 GCA all passed with bipartisan support. Reagan in fact supported the Brady Bill and the AWB. I mention that since Reagan seems to have a reputation for being incredibly pro-gun. The reason why I think the we have institutionalized pro-gun policies is that the status quo is to reject any gun control reforms pretty much out of hand.
