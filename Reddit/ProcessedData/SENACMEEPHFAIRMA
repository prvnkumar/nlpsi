Would you see a problem with one person holding 99.9999% of a country's wealth, while everyone else shared the rest?  Of course it's mathematically required that there is some inequality, and economically required that this inequality be of some significance.  But generally speaking, the higher a country's level of inequality, the higher its levels of crime and chances of civil unrest.\n\nA lot of people's problems with inequality comes from subjective value judgments.  It's definitely possible that in a different place, in a different time, no one would care if one person was born into a position where they did indeed control 99.9999% of a country's wealth.

What I think people have a problem with is that in the past couple of decades, when the economy was booming in good times (from the early 90's recession until the Great Recession), there was a lot of new money which entered the country's wealth pool, and most people didn't \"get their share\".\n\nWhile it would be normal for a larger portion of this wealth to go to those who already had a higher amount of the wealth, it seems that nearly all of this new wealth went to the already very wealthy, while the vast majority of people didn't gain any new wealth at all (when taking inflation into account).  This is where the argument of the rich stealing opportunity from the poor comes from.  It's not just that there is a gap between the rich and the poor, but that this gap is basically the widest it's ever been.  There's also the issue of decreasing social mobility.  The widening wealth gap is made more disturbing to people by the fact that it is now more difficult than it used to be to \"climb the social ladder\" as it were, or basically move up from one quintile (or any other breakdown of income groups) into the next one.", "id": "t1_cdux7s5", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "SENACMEEPHFAIRMA", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1s8914", "id": "t1_cduzh79", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Naurgul", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1s8914", "selftext": "Please elaborate.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Well you might have what other countries call a \"government\".  But in all seriousness, if the party was dead set on a certain agenda or extremely unified, then they could basically do whatever they liked with regular legislation, and all the problems that might come along with that (unchecked power, marginalization of their rivals, undiscovered corruption, etc.).\n\nHowever, it always seems like, in the American system at least, there are three main factors preventing this situation:\n\n1) **Judicial Oversight** - The judicial system plays an important role in guaranteeing the political and civic rights of the population and political rivals, thus weakening the ability for a party to dominate politics completely.  The amount of influence wielded by judges in political matters is probably enhanced by the fact that, in the U.S., they are also political entities.\n\n2) **Length of Time** - While I haven't looked into it very closely, it's my understanding that it is quite rare for one party to hold the House, Senate, and Presidency, especially for longer than a couple of years.  It's a matter of debate what causes these periodic shifts, but I don't think many Presidents have had the luxury of controlling the White House and both Houses of Congress for more than a single term.  Four years is not that long to dramatically change a country's political, social, or economic systems.\n\n3) **Separation of Powers** - Since the American executive and legislative branches are so (relatively) separate, it seems to me that when a single party does have control of the Presidency, House, and Senate, there tends to be a fairly large amount of disagreement within the party, and a lot of negotiation and compromise is required.  It makes sense that a party would be more likely to have disagreements and infighting when they control all three of those levers of power, in comparison to when they are facing off against another party in a sort of cohabitation kind of way.  Presidents rarely exercise the same degree of control over their parties that many other countries' Prime Ministers typically do, and this means that it's usually easy enough to get their support when another party is a threat compared to when only that one party can get things done, and formerly minor disagreements thus become much more significant.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I am no expert in this subject matter and am only offering a relatively uninformed and entirely subjective opinion.", "id": "t1_cdrbicu", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "SENACMEEPHFAIRMA", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1rv5fs", "score": -4, "retrieved_on": 1428434383, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1rv5fs", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdrbicu", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1385944850", "ups": -4, "distinguished": null}

The right to privacy, like all rights, is subject to reasonable limits.  People who are famous have a separate right not to have their likeness used without permission, but this only applies if your image has some value or can be used profitably.  For regular people, your right to privacy is subject to reasonable restrictions and considerations.  So, for example, someone in a public place has no reasonable expectation of privacy, so anybody taking photographs in this public place would not need that person's permission.\n\nCitizens also have a right against unreasonable (or unjustified) search and seizure of their person or belongings without their permission.  However, American courts have determined that certain NSA collection practices do not violate this right to be free from search and seizure (metadata isn't considered the same thing as your belongings in your home or pocket or car).  Also, when this metadata (or other evidence) supplies reasonable suspicion of illegal activities, the NSA (or other government agencies) can get court-ordered warrants to collect your private data, just as they would need to do in order to search your home or person.\n\nNow the government doesn't have \"rights\" in the same sense that citizens or corporations or other private entities do.  They have responsibilities, powers, and duties.  This applies to government agencies as well (including the NSA).

National security is one of the most powerful justifications of government secrecy in legal terms because judges tend to be cautious about challenging the government authority when it comes to something so important (the idea behind national security being that if you fuck it up, your state might not exist next week).  Therefore, the NSA is legally allowed to keep information from the public because it has been determined through a process created by legislative means that releasing this information might harm the country's national security, while American citizens also have a right to privacy subject to reasonable limitations (it can be infringed upon with reasonable cause).", "id": "t1_cd8zh9f", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "SENACMEEPHFAIRMA", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1q42rn", "score": 12, "retrieved_on": 1428753096, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1q42rn", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd8zh9f", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1383848785", "ups": 12, "distinguished": null}

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "To answer your first question about these other poles, there a number of candidates.  You mentioned the UK, but France has virtually the same military capabilities.  There's also the material power of Germany and Japan, vast potential power from India and Brazil, and an enormous amount of existing power from the PRC and the Russian Federation.  Which of these countries eventually emerge as counters to the U.S., and in what form (U.K. or EU?), I do not know.\n\nMy real issue with your comment is your definition though.  You seem to be taking an extremely \"naval-centric\" view of power.  Just an example of why I disagree wholeheartedly with that view:  if Soviet power had ever extended from the western shores of France to the Korean Peninsula, and from Siberia to the Mediterranean and Southeast Asia, then the country could have been economically and militarily dominant.  Even if they would have been unable to fight in another hemisphere or across an ocean.\n\nThe problem with your definition of unipolarity is that it implies that only great powers like the current U.S. or the former British Empire were \"real\" great powers, and that there is somehow less value in being able to project a million troops a thousand kilometers from your border than there is in being able to send a few hundred thousand troops several thousand kilometers away.  It really depends on the country in question and the geopolitical situation, regardless of how impressive logistically one feat is over another.\n\nThe U.S. is in a unique position since it has no real regional competitors and is isolated from much of the world, so it relies on power projection, but other possible poles of a multipolar system have little to no concern with projecting power in another hemisphere, because most, if not all, of their national interests occur within their own hemisphere, if not their own continent.  The Eurasian landmass is where these countries will be most interested, as well as Africa which is very close by.\n\nAnd honestly, 10 000 troops is not very much, assuming that by \"equipment\" you mean just the troops' equipment, and not tanks or APVs, and you're talking about doing this in just one trip, then I know the PLAN is more or less capable of doing so already.  If we talk about Australia or somewhere else in Oceania, for example, as being that other hemisphere then we can see that, even excluding the PLAN's new aircraft carrier and any future aircraft carriers or amphibious ships, the PLAN's current complement of 3 Type 071 transport docks along with dozens of landing ships (mostly medium or tank and generally capable of carrying 250 fully equipped troops or more depending on variant) could easily ferry 10 000 fully equipped troops in a single trip, and if every amphibious ship was used to its full capacity then they could likely more or less double the 10 000 troop requirement.\n\nI don't know much about other countries' navies, but I doubt that any besides the U.S. and PRC could accomplish this in a single trip as things tand right now, but perhaps the U.K. and France could.  If you're willing to look at more unconventional uses of traditional military hardware (using non-amphibious attack ships for amphibious landings or simple transportation), and allow for multiple trips, then I am confident that we could add some other countries into the mix, probably starting with India or Japan, and maybe including Italy or Spain.  Also, Russia's landing craft and aircraft carrier combined could probably come pretty close to bringing 10 000 troops into southern or central Africa, but they might fall short a couple thousand, I don't really know to be honest.\n\nI really don't think that this is a good gauge of relative material power capabilities, though.

The share of the global economy that American GDP (PPP) represents has been declining since 1999.  While American military power remains generally unchallenged in its supremacy, its share of global military spending has also been shrinking in recent years.  Furthermore, the gaps between the U.S. and other countries in both quantity and quality of military forces have also been shrinking.\n\nAt the same time, a reduction in American political will for overseas operations, reduced spending (both military and non-military), and lowered international opinion of the U.S. (since the start of the Iraq War) have all reduced American capacity to influence the policies of other countries, and reduced their relative power in the international system.  The balance of power may be unipolar now, but the strength of that unipolarity has not been this weak since the end of the Cold War.\n\nI've always viewed balances of power less as a black and white issue (like how some people view democracy, a country is either a democracy or it is not) and more as a sliding scale (like something may make a country more or less democratic).  It's always difficult, if not impossible, to determine exactly when the balance of power shifts in the international system, but I think we are well on the way to multipolar international system and, if American unipolarity peaked in the mid 1990's to the mid 2000's, then I would venture a guess that we are roughly half way between this peak and a time of undisputed multipolarity (mid 2020's to mid 2030's), even if the U.S. remains the \"first among equals\" during this new multipolar balance of power.\n\nAnd on that side note, yes this has been an enjoyable debate and it is nice to talk with others who recognize the importance of those fine details and of debating them.\n\nEDIT: Grammar", "id": "t1_cd6v44b", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "SENACMEEPHFAIRMA", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "What are these other poles?

You mentioned the UK, but France has virtually the same military capabilities.  There's also the material power of Germany and Japan, vast potential power from India and Brazil, and an enormous amount of existing power from the PRC and the Russian Federation.  Which of these countries eventually emerge as counters to the U.S., and in what form (U.K. or EU?), I do not know.\n\nMy real issue with your comment is your definition though.  You seem to be taking an extremely \"naval-centric\" view of power.  Just an example of why I disagree wholeheartedly with that view:  if Soviet power had ever extended from the western shores of France to the Korean Peninsula, and from Siberia to the Mediterranean and Southeast Asia, then the country could have been economically and militarily dominant.  Even if they would have been unable to fight in another hemisphere or across an ocean.\n\nThe problem with your definition of unipolarity is that it implies that only great powers like the current U.S. or the former British Empire were \"real\" great powers, and that there is somehow less value in being able to project a million troops a thousand kilometers from your border than there is in being able to send a few hundred thousand troops several thousand kilometers away.  It really depends on the country in question and the geopolitical situation, regardless of how impressive logistically one feat is over another.\n\nThe U.S. is in a unique position since it has no real regional competitors and is isolated from much of the world, so it relies on power projection, but other possible poles of a multipolar system have little to no concern with projecting power in another hemisphere, because most, if not all, of their national interests occur within their own hemisphere, if not their own continent.  The Eurasian landmass is where these countries will be most interested, as well as Africa which is very close by.\n\nAnd honestly, 10 000 troops is not very much, assuming that by \"equipment\" you mean just the troops' equipment, and not tanks or APVs, and you're talking about doing this in just one trip, then I know the PLAN is more or less capable of doing so already.  If we talk about Australia or somewhere else in Oceania, for example, as being that other hemisphere then we can see that, even excluding the PLAN's new aircraft carrier and any future aircraft carriers or amphibious ships, the PLAN's current complement of 3 Type 071 transport docks along with dozens of landing ships (mostly medium or tank and generally capable of carrying 250 fully equipped troops or more depending on variant) could easily ferry 10 000 fully equipped troops in a single trip, and if every amphibious ship was used to its full capacity then they could likely more or less double the 10 000 troop requirement.\n\nI don't know much about other countries' navies, but I doubt that any besides the U.S. and PRC could accomplish this in a single trip as things tand right now, but perhaps the U.K. and France could.  If you're willing to look at more unconventional uses of traditional military hardware (using non-amphibious attack ships for amphibious landings or simple transportation), and allow for multiple trips, then I am confident that we could add some other countries into the mix, probably starting with India or Japan, and maybe including Italy or Spain.  Also, Russia's landing craft and aircraft carrier combined could probably come pretty close to bringing 10 000 troops into southern or central Africa, but they might fall short a couple thousand, I don't really know to be honest.\n\nI really don't think that this is a good gauge of relative material power capabilities, though.

Or they could take boats. Hell they could march. But they could not do this if the US made it a priority to prevent it.\n\nI chose that example because it so small and simple yet it clearly shows how far behind the US the rest of the world is in terms of military capacity. We saw PLA troops [*marching*](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/world/asia/02china.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0) into Sichuan after the 2008 earthquake. This is inside their own borders.

Possibly even France or India could pull this off.  While American sea power is currently effectively unchallenged, their air power has limits, especially in the face of advanced air defense systems.  I think that they would lose far too many of their planes and pilots to both dogfighting and air defense systems before they could bring down even a sizable amount of another great power's land forces.\n\nThe fact that we're having the conversation is itself a testament to the large gap in military capabilities, but even American power projection has limits.  I doubt the American capacity to fight a major land war against another great power on the Eurasian landmass because it would present far greater logistical problems than Iraq and Afghanistan combined, and they would have to deal with far higher levels of attrition.\n\nMost importantly, I think that your assessment of \"the next few decades\" is an extremely overoptimistic assessment of American capabilities.  It's impossible to know how military capabilities will match up in even twenty years, and the anti-access and area denial capabilities of the PLAN are already casting doubt on the American ability to project power within the first island chain by the end of the decade.\n\nMaterial power must be backed by both resolve and credibility to be effective, and I think it's questionable whether the U.S. can maintain such resolve and credibility in so many regions and on so many issues, especially when many of those issues are far less salient to them than they are to the relevant actors in their own regions.  This problem is only amplified by their decreasing levels of material power relative to other major actors on the international stage.\n\nIt is certainly possible that no other state may be able to match American military power for several decades, but I really think that they will come close enough to have much greater freedom of movement and action within their own regions within the next one to two decades.  Their military power may not be comparable to the U.S. in the sense that their capacity to launch military operations in the Americas will not even come close to the American ability to launch military operations in their own regional theatres, but I am confident that they will still have the capacity to operate in their own regions at a comparable level to the U.S., at least to the extent that the U.S. would no longer have free reign in its actions in those theatres.", "id": "t1_cd74iqr", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "SENACMEEPHFAIRMA", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1pwk5w", "selftext": "With prior warning, I think the US could stop Russia or China from an invasion with a speed bump worth of US troops and a mutual defense treaty, making that \"unstoppable\" invasion force a war with the US.\n\nI don't question your military analysis in terms of capabilities.

Furthermore, the gaps between the U.S. and other countries in both quantity and quality of military forces have also been shrinking.\n\nAt the same time, a reduction in American political will for overseas operations, reduced spending (both military and non-military), and lowered international opinion of the U.S. (since the start of the Iraq War) have all reduced American capacity to influence the policies of other countries, and reduced their relative power in the international system.  The balance of power may be unipolar now, but the strength of that unipolarity has not been this weak since the end of the Cold War.\n\nI've always viewed balances of power less as a black and white issue (like how some people view democracy, a country is either a democracy or it is not) and more as a sliding scale (like something may make a country more or less democratic).  It's always difficult, if not impossible, to determine exactly when the balance of power shifts in the international system, but I think we are well on the way to multipolar international system and, if American unipolarity peaked in the mid 1990's to the mid 2000's, then I would venture a guess that we are roughly half way between this peak and a time of undisputed multipolarity (mid 2020's to mid 2030's), even if the U.S. remains the \"first among equals\" during this new multipolar balance of power.\n\nAnd on that side note, yes this has been an enjoyable debate and it is nice to talk with others who recognize the importance of those fine details and of debating them.\n\nEDIT: Grammar", "id": "t1_cd6v44b", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "SENACMEEPHFAIRMA", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "What are these other poles?

You mentioned the UK, but France has virtually the same military capabilities.  There's also the material power of Germany and Japan, vast potential power from India and Brazil, and an enormous amount of existing power from the PRC and the Russian Federation.  Which of these countries eventually emerge as counters to the U.S., and in what form (U.K. or EU?), I do not know.\n\nMy real issue with your comment is your definition though.  You seem to be taking an extremely \"naval-centric\" view of power.  Just an example of why I disagree wholeheartedly with that view:  if Soviet power had ever extended from the western shores of France to the Korean Peninsula, and from Siberia to the Mediterranean and Southeast Asia, then the country could have been economically and militarily dominant.  Even if they would have been unable to fight in another hemisphere or across an ocean.\n\nThe problem with your definition of unipolarity is that it implies that only great powers like the current U.S. or the former British Empire were \"real\" great powers, and that there is somehow less value in being able to project a million troops a thousand kilometers from your border than there is in being able to send a few hundred thousand troops several thousand kilometers away.  It really depends on the country in question and the geopolitical situation, regardless of how impressive logistically one feat is over another.\n\nThe U.S. is in a unique position since it has no real regional competitors and is isolated from much of the world, so it relies on power projection, but other possible poles of a multipolar system have little to no concern with projecting power in another hemisphere, because most, if not all, of their national interests occur within their own hemisphere, if not their own continent.  The Eurasian landmass is where these countries will be most interested, as well as Africa which is very close by.\n\nAnd honestly, 10 000 troops is not very much, assuming that by \"equipment\" you mean just the troops' equipment, and not tanks or APVs, and you're talking about doing this in just one trip, then I know the PLAN is more or less capable of doing so already.  If we talk about Australia or somewhere else in Oceania, for example, as being that other hemisphere then we can see that, even excluding the PLAN's new aircraft carrier and any future aircraft carriers or amphibious ships, the PLAN's current complement of 3 Type 071 transport docks along with dozens of landing ships (mostly medium or tank and generally capable of carrying 250 fully equipped troops or more depending on variant) could easily ferry 10 000 fully equipped troops in a single trip, and if every amphibious ship was used to its full capacity then they could likely more or less double the 10 000 troop requirement.\n\nI don't know much about other countries' navies, but I doubt that any besides the U.S. and PRC could accomplish this in a single trip as things tand right now, but perhaps the U.K. and France could.  If you're willing to look at more unconventional uses of traditional military hardware (using non-amphibious attack ships for amphibious landings or simple transportation), and allow for multiple trips, then I am confident that we could add some other countries into the mix, probably starting with India or Japan, and maybe including Italy or Spain.  Also, Russia's landing craft and aircraft carrier combined could probably come pretty close to bringing 10 000 troops into southern or central Africa, but they might fall short a couple thousand, I don't really know to be honest.\n\nI really don't think that this is a good gauge of relative material power capabilities, though.

While American sea power is currently effectively unchallenged, their air power has limits, especially in the face of advanced air defense systems.  I think that they would lose far too many of their planes and pilots to both dogfighting and air defense systems before they could bring down even a sizable amount of another great power's land forces.\n\nThe fact that we're having the conversation is itself a testament to the large gap in military capabilities, but even American power projection has limits.  I doubt the American capacity to fight a major land war against another great power on the Eurasian landmass because it would present far greater logistical problems than Iraq and Afghanistan combined, and they would have to deal with far higher levels of attrition.\n\nMost importantly, I think that your assessment of \"the next few decades\" is an extremely overoptimistic assessment of American capabilities.  It's impossible to know how military capabilities will match up in even twenty years, and the anti-access and area denial capabilities of the PLAN are already casting doubt on the American ability to project power within the first island chain by the end of the decade.\n\nMaterial power must be backed by both resolve and credibility to be effective, and I think it's questionable whether the U.S. can maintain such resolve and credibility in so many regions and on so many issues, especially when many of those issues are far less salient to them than they are to the relevant actors in their own regions.  This problem is only amplified by their decreasing levels of material power relative to other major actors on the international stage.\n\nIt is certainly possible that no other state may be able to match American military power for several decades, but I really think that they will come close enough to have much greater freedom of movement and action within their own regions within the next one to two decades.  Their military power may not be comparable to the U.S. in the sense that their capacity to launch military operations in the Americas will not even come close to the American ability to launch military operations in their own regional theatres, but I am confident that they will still have the capacity to operate in their own regions at a comparable level to the U.S., at least to the extent that the U.S. would no longer have free reign in its actions in those theatres.", "id": "t1_cd74iqr", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "SENACMEEPHFAIRMA", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1pwk5w", "selftext": "With prior warning, I think the US could stop Russia or China from an invasion with a speed bump worth of US troops and a mutual defense treaty, making that \"unstoppable\" invasion force a war with the US.\n\nI don't question your military analysis in terms of capabilities.

The difference between the current GOP push that you mention and mandatory voting is that the GOP directly benefits by keeping certain demographics away from voting while also enhancing their \"law and order\" image among their base and swing voters, but if the Dems brought in mandatory voting (since the GOP would not), then it would not only look like a power grab (thus losing them support) but might also alienate or otherwise piss off the people who are now required to vote, and who might vote GOP since the GOP didn't bring in this new law that forces them to do something new under threat of punishment, just make their decisions (effectively) randomly, or simply abstain.\n\nI think it is a mistake to extrapolate numbers in such a way without hard statistical evidence to back it up beforehand indicating reasons why most non-voters do not vote and indicating how they would vote, not if they did vote, but if they were forced to vote.  So for example, maybe Group X is underrepresented because voter turnout in the last election was 95%, but only 80% of Group X voted in the last election.  Now, 75% of Group X who voted, or 60% of the entire Group X, voted for Party A, while the remaining 25% who voted, or 20% of the entire Group X, voted for Party B.  So supporters of Party A and organizations representing Group X teamed up to pass a mandatory voting law.  So now 100% of Group X votes, and supporters of the new law expect that 75% of the entire Group X will vote for Party A.  This reasoning rests on a number of assumptions that cannot be known beforehand.\n\nSuppose that the new voters in Group X are unhappy about being forced to vote, or perhaps never supported Party A but simply refrained from voting.  Perhaps now the numbers are reversed, and the new voters of Group X vote 75% in favour of Party B and 25% in favour of Party A.  This would mean that the new overall voting of Group X is 65% for Party A and 35% for Party B.  This not only harms the interests of Party A (whose supporters helped bring about mandatory voting), but also shatters Group X's illusions of its own solidarity and homogeneity in terms of political beliefs.  Perhaps the pro-Party A organizations that represent Group X now lose popularity and funding due to such shattered illusions and the new ways in which both Group X, and other outsider groups, view Group X's makeup.  Thus both Group X and Party A are harmed, despite the fact that their supporters were the ones behind the shift to mandatory voting.  And perhaps all of Group X, and maybe all of society, is further harmed because Party B is a terrible party, who now commands 35% of Group X's vote, compared to its previous 20%.", "id": "t1_cd4ja02", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "SENACMEEPHFAIRMA", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cd3tvov", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428898740, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd4ja02", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1383326708", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

Most people don't like to feel like they are being *forced* to do anything.  The mandatory nature of taxation is the second-most responsible reason for its unpopularity.  People like to have options, or at least feel like they have options, regardless of what their ultimate decision is going to be.\n\nNow, think about what political movements often entail.  Think tanks issue opinions; lobbyists make their rounds; organizations attempt to inspire people; grassroots activists lay the groundwork; volunteers go door to door; people spread information and ideologies; etc.  Basically, people and organizations *get involved*.  People who have an interest in, and a desire for, getting involved are the same people who are most likely to already be voting regularly.  A mass political movement for this goal would essentially involve thousands or tens of thousands of people spending time, energy, and intellectual effort to try to pass a law that would in no way affect them personally.

They both stem from my strongly held belief that the most sacred duty of the state is the protection of its population, the survival of the country, and the maintenance of sovereignty and independence:\n\n1) The necessity of a strong security establishment and powerful intelligence agency:  I firmly believe that, because you cannot control how other states act towards you (although you can influence it through diplomatic/economic actions), that it's far better to have powerful intelligence and security services.  You can never be sure that a conflict isn't about to break out, so I think it's better to be prepared, have tabs on everyone in your country that might pose a threat during such conflict, have information (or the ability to collect information) on any other possible country, and even be able to engage in direct actions against other countries (reconnaissance, espionage, sabotage, assassinations, setting up of front companies/organizations/political parties or whatever else to promote your interests, etc.).\n\n2)  Everyone should be required to do some kind of mandatory civic service:  I believe that everyone, sometime between their 18th and 25th birthdays, should have to commit a couple of years to the state and society.  This would generally take the form of military service, with mandatory occasional training sessions until a certain age (like one weekend a month or one week every few months until the age of 40 or something).  This creates a large body of trained recruits that can be quickly formed into a militia in the case of an invasion or attack against the country.  I feel that, with much of the population being at risk of having to fight a war, this would make the population less likely to accept government decisions to take military actions for insignificant or spurious reasons.  To those unable or unwilling to do military service, there should be a variety of other options, many of which would be considered \"community service\".  Helping the elderly, supervising children, cleaning up public spaces, assisting people who are homeless or living in poverty.  In addition to creating a more well-defended country militarily, I feel that mandatory civic service would increase feelings of solidarity and equality among national populations at large.  I also think that those who complete their civic service should be guaranteed free post-secondary education of some sort by the government so that they can gain the necessary skills, training, and education to successfully enter the job market after finishing their civic duty.", "id": "t1_ccrnw2o", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "SENACMEEPHFAIRMA", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1oes0r", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1429132127, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1oes0r", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ccrnw2o", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1381783339", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}

Their (full-time) job is to be persuasive, to try to negotiate compromises, and, perhaps most importantly, to take the time to understand complex policies and ideas and ascertain whether those things would benefit their constituents.\n- Have you thought about how this would work in practice?  How simple do all of the bills or laws or motions have to become for everyone to vote on them?  This goes back to my previous point, but single pieces of legislation often run hundreds of pages.  How do you express that into a few sentences or paragraphs that regular people, many of whom have their own full-time jobs, can read, think about, and vote on?\n- What is this system you're talking about?  There's representatives still, but people also vote on things?  People can have a direct political voice through encrypted systems?  How does that work?  When does it happen?  Your idea just sounds like a (more transparent and accountable) representative democracy where people can express their views officially.\n- Also, if you look at the history of humanity, usurping and starting over almost always ends up WAY worse than a process of slow and gradual reform.  Not saying that the reform path will always happen or work, but sudden changes tend to be extremely shocking, strongly contested, violent, bloody, and a transformation into something worse or, at best, maybe something slightly better (after a long period of suffering for all involved).", "id": "t1_ccpgbp3", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "SENACMEEPHFAIRMA", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1o77lo", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429169965, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ccpgbp3", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1381476542", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

This includes countries that are parliamentary \"constitutional monarchies\", many of which were formerly part of the British Empire (and thus employ the Westminster style of Parliament).  Some constitutional monarchies are Canada, Australia, the UK, Spain, Thailand, and many others.\n\nThere are also \"parliamentary republics\", where there are elected presidents (or other heads of state), but these presidents either serve mostly ceremonial/symbolic roles or, when they do have real power that is used, are still mostly \"subordinate\" to the parliament.  Examples include India, Germany, Austria, Greece, and Turkey, among others.\n\nIt's important to recognize that parliamentary systems will typically hold elections whenever a leader loses a vote of confidence.  As far as I know, budget votes almost always fall into this category.  But there are many other votes of confidence where a loss can result in new elections.  The executive (ceremonial or otherwise) of a parliamentary system may ask another party leader to try and form a coalition instead of having new elections, but if they cannot get a majority of the votes then there will be new elections.\n\nThis is in contrast to presidential systems (like the U.S. or Brazil) and semi-presidential systems (like France or Russia), where the presidents exercise a great deal of authority and power, although the exact relationships vary between countries.  It's my understanding that the primary difference between these two systems is that, in a pure presidential system, the president is both the head of state and government, and appoints the cabinet, whereas a semi-presidential system may have a separate head of government (like a prime minister) and members of the cabinet can be dismissed by the legislature.", "id": "t1_ccj549c", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "SENACMEEPHFAIRMA", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1nijn6", "score": 5, "retrieved_on": 1429278118, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ccj549c", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1380665708", "ups": 5, "distinguished": null}

It shouldn't be too hard since it's unclear whether America's benefits or costs would outweigh the other.  This is not true for Russia.  Putin has effectively improved Russia's global image, his own reputation, and his ally's chances of survival.  Everyone's talking about a Russian \"diplomatic coup\".  This is true only in comparison to where Russia stood when America was readying a strike against Assad.  If you look at where Russia stood *before* the major CW attack, you'll see that their ally was in a stronger position and the U.S. had effectively excused itself from the crisis.  Nevertheless, Russia's diplomatic success may make up for this shift.  What it will not make up for is the vast amount of Russian influence lost in the entire region since the Arab Spring began.  But that is probably outside the scope of this discussion.  Russia **wins** (compared to its position in late August/early September).\n\n**Israel** - There is significant disagreement as to whether Israel would prefer for Assad to be toppled or not.  I am convinced that it would prefer this civil war go on forever, occupying both Assad (a longtime enemy) and jihadists that might pose a threat to Israel.  In any case, the only real WMD program in the region (possibly excluding Iran's) that could even plausibly hold a candle to Israel's is now gone, and the stalemate on the battlefield will likely continue.  Israel **wins**.\n\n**Iran** - This is another tricky one.  Obviously the Iranian-led Axis of Resistance is weakened due to Assad's loss of his most powerful weapons (and Israel's subsequent gains), but it also looks good for Iran because of the country's deep-seated hatred of CW (due to the suffering of tens of thousands of Iranian casualties at the hands of Saddam's CW use during the Iran-Iraq War).  In comparison to before the deal, when an American strike appeared imminent, Assad's chances of survival seem significantly higher now, which only benefits Iran.  The CW deal may also make it easier for Iran to find a diplomatic solution to its own (nuclear program related ) conflict with the West, something that the new government is apparently very interested in.  Iran **wins** far more than it *loses*.\n\n**Assad** - Certainly a major victory.  While he was rather fond of all those CW (for their previously mentioned benefits vis-a-vis Israel), he is certainly in a stronger position if there are no American air strikes.  His chances of survival are increased.  He looks a lot more humanitarian, reasonable, and legitimate internationally.  His popularity is increased.  Russia, his most powerful ally, increases its global prestige.  No doubt, Assad **wins**.\n\n**Syrian Rebels** - Not really much to say here either.  They feel betrayed by the West.  They lost what was probably their best chance to gain territory at the regime's expense (following the previously planned air strikes).  Assad comes out looking a lot better.  The entire UNSC agrees to a plan that they vehemently oppose.  The Syrian rebels collectively **lose**.\n\n**Gulf States/Turkey** - It's a bit weird to lump these countries together since they tend to support different rebel factions (in particular Saudi Arabia and Qatar).  But for the purposes of this examination, they are all collectively upset at America and alarmed by both its reluctance to intervene (especially the Gulf States since they worry that America will hesitate against Iran's nuclear program as well) and its acquiescence to a deal that legitimizes Assad and increases the prestige of Russia.  These countries all **lose**. \n\n**Others** - Europeans like this as they were also reluctant to intervene (even France probably prefers diplomatic path).  China loves preventing U.S. from unilateral military actions.\n\nI also really wanted to mention how a successful deal will dramatically increase the odds of finding a diplomatic solution to the civil war writ large, but couldn't fit it in anywhere.  So I will just awkwardly add it at the end here.  I predict that, if the CW deal goes ahead as planned and most or all CW are out of Syria by mid-2014, Assad will follow soon after.  Mid-2014 also happens to be when Assad's current presidential term ends.  I don't think he will be killed or forced out.  He will leave on his own terms.  He will probably get some kind of (formal or informal) amnesty for himself, his family, and certain close associates, as well as an offer of safe (and comfortable) living in some other country, while some of his former colleagues take over (Russian preference).  This will effectively extend the life of the regime (and its position as a Russian ally), while ending the bloodshed and either partitioning the country (specifically with the Kurds) or reuniting most of it under a transitional government led by former Assad-era officials and opposition authorities.\n\nTL;DR Fuck you.", "id": "t1_ccgbeiy", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "SENACMEEPHFAIRMA", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1n86t0", "id": "t1_ccgdbxn", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Chromavita", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_ccgbeiy", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1429326525, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Nicely written, thank you.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1n86t0", "selftext": "I apologize in advance for the length and also for any inaccuracies since this is entirely off the top of my head.  I'm in a mood both to ramble about something that I closely follow every day, and also not to fact check.\n\n\n**An Agreement?**\n\nThey already have, for all intents and purposes, reached an agreement on chemical weapons (CW).  The only problem now is the implementation of that agreement.  If a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is passed tomorrow, as seems likely, this would give a big boost to the prospects of successful implementation.  The plan calls for inspectors on the ground by November I believe (maybe mid to late October?), so that they can take account of all the sites and weapons declared by the Syrian government, and then begin the destruction process.\n\n\n**Implementation**\n\nThis is where it gets really hard.  ALL of Syria's CW (I think about 1000 tonnes) are supposed to be destroyed by mid-2014.  Even if all of the CW were in a single, centralized location, with unhindered access granted to weapons experts, all the funding necessary, and no conflicts happening around this single location, it would still be difficult to destroy that quantity of CW in that time frame.\n\nAs you likely know, these ideal conditions do not reflect reality.  The weapons are dispersed among dozens of locations around the country.  Some of these sites may not be entirely controlled by the regime forces.  At the very least, there is certainly intensive and ongoing violence happening very close to some of these locations.  I believe that all of the relevant rebel groups have denounced the plan and refused to abide by its terms, which makes ceasefires unlikely.\n\n\n**Syrian Solutions**\n\nSo the first obvious solution would be to remove the CW from these sites to more secure locations, ideally centralizing all of the weapons into a much smaller number of secure, centralized, and accessible locations.  However, extreme difficulties also arise from this potential solution.  It is almost inconceivable to imagine that regime forces, which have been unable to prevent the country's fragmentation, would be successful in effectively securing, transporting, and storing the entire country's CW arsenal.  Whether problems arose from attacks or ambushes by rebel forces, rogue regime commanders disobeying orders, or even a simple accident, the consequences could be widespread and deadly.\n\nEven if Syrian forces could successfully escort all of the CW to secure locations within the country, inspectors would likely still encounter further severe difficulties, such as government interference or delays, attacks on CW inspectors, being able to safely store the large quantities of weapons, the chance of sudden regime collapse, the possibility of rebel attacks on these new sites, etc.\n\n\n**Other (Russian) Solutions**\n\nIn my opinion, the only way this plan has a chance of success (and also the second obvious solution) is for the CW to be removed from the country.  My best idea would be for the CW to be taken by Russian troops onto Russian ships from the Russian port in Tartus and transferred to Russian territory where Russian, American, and international experts could oversee their safe storage, transportation, and destruction over a number (probably a double digit number) of years.\n\nI THINK that Russia has offered troops to protect chemical weapons production facilities and storage locations.  This raises a further number of issues.  How many troops would be necessary?  How would they arrive?  Who would supervise them?  What would be their exact role?  It is not difficult to imagine a number of uncomfortable scenarios.  If rebels attack Russian troops, how do they respond?  Is it acceptable for rebels who've sworn loyalty to a group that the West recognizes as the legitimate government of Syria to be bombed or otherwise slaughtered by the Russians?  What if Russian troops do more than absolutely necessary to secure the CW, vis-a-vis \"defense\" against rebels?  The Russian government could easily find justifications to \"degrade the abilities\" (to use American military parlance) of the rebels, thus helping out their ally Assad, while removing the CW from Syria.  What if Russian troops are responsible for CW accident?  What if civilians protest, barricade, block, or otherwise harass the Russian forces?  Would they be justified in responding with lethal force?  Could Russia justify bringing tanks, trucks, APVs, rocket artillery, gunship helicopters, fighter jets, strategic bombers, or other relatively advanced military forces into Syria to defend their troops and the CW they are protecting?\n\nIn any case, there are no easy answers or simple solutions.  The best choice is probably for an international UN peacekeeping force numbering AT LEAST 10 000 strong (if not 20 000 to 30 000), consisting mostly of Russian troops but organized, operated, administered, and led under the UN banner, quickly entering the country (by the end of this year or the start of the new one) to escort all of the CW from the dozens of sites to a port, where they could be removed from the country and brought to Russia or Europe.  The U.S. would have to play a major role in providing diplomatic and, more importantly, financial support.\n\n\n**Who wins and who loses?**\n\nThis a tricky question.  Diplomacy is not warfare or chess, so there is hardly ever a clear winner and loser.  Indeed diplomacy, by its very nature, is the art of negotiation and compromise.  All of the talk of winners and losers is mostly used by analysts and pundits to draw attention to themselves and make newsworthy headlines.  But let's take a look at who would be in stronger or weaker positions, RELATIVE to where they are (or where they were) before the deal.\n\n**The United States** - Obama looks weak.  It's obvious he did not want to intervene in Syria.  He didn't intervene when intervention would have been easier and more effective.  After the CW attack (August 21?), he indicated that a strike was likely imminent.  He really emphasized that.  He pressured David Cameron to get a vote from the British Parliament, which proved embarrassing for the British PM when he lost.\n\nObama tried to organize a grand international coalition, but was left with material support from France, and only moral support from other countries.  So to strengthen his hand (and preempt domestic criticism) he went to Congress.  This backfired, as it looked like he would lose the vote.  The American public was against it.  It's clear that this agreement offered Obama a (welcome) way out of air strikes.\n\nAmerica can *claim victory* (getting rid of Assad's CW) while not having to do something they didn't want to do.  This was obvious even today when a \"breakthrough\" (according to U.S. State Dep) was announced on a possible UNSC Resolution, even though it was basically what Russia wanted all along (no condemnation of Assad, no assignment of guilt for CW attacks, no automatic military enforcement, etc.).\n\nObama has also ceded the diplomatic initiative to Russia.  So when America's opponents (real or potential) or allies (ditto) look at this case, they will see that America indicated it would do something that was considered drastic by its previous policy standards, backed away from doing it in order to garner domestic support, appeared to be uncertain or unlikely to gain that domestic support, and then accepted the first (im)plausible solution to resolve the issue without taking previously determined actions.\n\nSo, Obama looks weak in this sense.  On the other hand, an enemy of America (and Israel) has lost one of his most potent weapons (while many analysts have rightly pointed out that CW have proven of little use in the civil war, the Syrian regime still invested heavily in acquiring and maintaining them, and always viewed them as an insurance policy against Israel's nuclear stockpile).  America **wins** and **loses**:  it's unclear whether the positives or negatives are superior, and it's unlikely to become clear for a LONG time.\n\n**Continued...**", "id": "t1_ccgbeem", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "SENACMEEPHFAIRMA", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1n86t0", "selftext": "**...Russia** - Shit.
