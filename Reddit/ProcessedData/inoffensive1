I get treated and find out I have some chronic disease because I waited to long to be treated since I couldn't afford to go to the doctor. Now I owe the Emergency room a large amount of money.\n\nSince I don't have insurance I have to pay out of pocket for my medications and the treatments I need. Being that I can't even afford insurance I can't pay these bills and I go bankrupt trying to pay them off as my bills reach the 10s of thousands.\n\nUnder the ACA if I can't afford insurance I can get medicaid. If I am in one of the red states that didn't expand medicaid then I can't afford insurance so i have to pay mandate.  Currently that mandate is only $95 bucks for an adult but lets say its 2016 and I owe the $695 dollars. \n\nIf I don't get sick that means I paid $695 dollars for nothing.\n\nIf I do get sick though instead of having to go to the Emergency room I can sign up for insurance and they can't refuse me for pre-existing condition. Now I can go to the doctor and the insurance pays for the visit and for my medication and treatments.\n\nTo sum up I can either pay nothing and hope not to get sick but if I do end up owing 10,000 of dollars that  I can't afford or with the ACA I can not get sick and pay 58 bucks a month but if I do get sick I can still get insurance which will cover all my medical expenses.\n\n\n&gt;So instead they send you a bill that somewhat resembles what people with insurance pay and charge the government for the rest. \n\nSo you think it is better for everyone else to pay taxes because this person doesn't have insurance then for this person to pay an individual tax for not having insurance.", "id": "t1_ccs6acb", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Filbert_Turtle", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ohmii", "id": "t1_ccs73nt", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "faceless_masses", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;For some reason I doubt you are actually talking about you.\n\nYour right it is not, it is an example.\n\n&gt;his supposed person you reference who can't afford insurance will be just fine.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1f9ff9", "selftext": "In the long run, everything balances out into peace, harmony, and communism.\n\nMore relevant to your question, perhaps, is that you can't stop kids from working, and you can't stop companies from seeking out the cheapest supply of labor.  Government action can augment the cost of the local labor supply (and that action may or may not serve to directly augment the quality of life of the local labor supply).\n\nIt's important to remember that, for better or worse, the market does seek equilibrium.\n\nChild labor is a thing, because there isn't an alternative to it.  If you prevent them from collecting pay legitimately, and their parents aren't there or aren't making enough to feed them, they'll find illegitimate work.  Maybe this is just farming, or maybe this is prostitution.\n\nLow wages and long hours are a thing, because without them, many people are left with the alternative of farming dirt or turning to crime.\n\nLow wages and long hours in a low-elbow-room environment breeds *organization*.  Labor unions are born there.  This is a powerful social force which, as the industrial wealth of a group grows, pushes more and more in favor of what we think of as a \"modern\" standard of living: a standard workweek which reserves personal time without sacrificing basic necessities, rules regulating workplace safety and conduct, a higher share of profits for the workforce, etc.\n\nAs wealth grows at the top, and the suppliers of labor become more insistent on a greater share of it, they're able to begin accumulating.  This is the cornerstone of the \"give my kids a better shot than I had\" motivation.\n\nUltimately, while it's kind of shitty to see 6-year-olds stitching together Nikes, until those with wealth start giving it freely *en masse* to improve the quality of life for people in need of infrastructure, schools, and overall stability, it's going to happen, and it's better for the kid and for Nike than the available alternative.\n\nFortunately, we can more or less predict that with a lot of discipline and a little luck, the 6-year-old will grow into a grandparent whose kids graduate from college as doctors or mechanics or art history majors.  His industrializing nation will likely get to that point within his lifetime.\n\nOf course, then his grandkid could grow up thinking that work is what happens when you show up and get paid, and then they'll kick up their feet in their \"earned\" retirement and complain about \"kids these days\" while the rest of us fight through yet another financial crisis...\n\nSo, what does this mean, globally and in the long run?  Sooner or later, we'll make automated sneaker-stitching more cost-effective than hiring kids, both because global standards have risen to make kids more expensive (by providing alternatives for the kids, like \"here, kid, go have some breakfast and schooling and lunch and schooling, on us\"), and because the grandkids get to be mechanics or engineers or scientists or women's studies majors.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is the 'technological innovation to unemployment' question.  In most post-industrial nations today, the Service sector is a driving economic force.  This is, quite literally, economic activity which only occurs because one person has no better place to sell their labor than to meet another, more wealthy person's desire *to be served*.\n\nPersonally, I don't think that this is sustainable.  Admittedly, I'm a pessimist, so I'll speculate about some other reasonable outcomes first:\n\n - The service sector balances everything out, once it becomes culturally accepted that each person is supposed to labor in service and each person is supposed to engage the use of service.  Through government action, as well as through market forces like a labor movement, income inequality should either shrink to a less nauseating level, or become irrelevant when those on the lower end have their needs met and real equal opportunity for advancement.\n\n - The service sector balances everything out, because it will be accepted that those who own technological innovations deserve autonomy over their profits, and autonomy over their profits translates into political influence and *power*, in a very real sense.  Much like today in America, only globally, the mentality will be that those in service are either working diligently on their way up, or stuck in place by choice.\n\nEither way, getting through a process of industrialization, accumulating wealth and forging a middle class is great for the entire population, and it's a prerequisite for this kind of Service-driven economy (or perhaps you could say it's required for clearing the 'productive work' out of the way, and a Service sector is what fills in the void).\n\nI'm more pessimistic, though.  We haven't seen a significant social reaction to the service sector.  It's possible that we won't.  It's also possible that we will, and we'll see it around the same time some vital scarcity sets in (Peak oil?  Peak nickel?  Peak potable water?)  If there's one thing that industrialized capitalist nations have proven adept at, it's waging war.  The service sector will all but evaporate, leaving the poor to either go to war, build the weapons of war, or be unemployed.  In the aftermath, the poor will be the ones rebuilding.  In another generation, service will run the economy again, millions and millions will have been killed, and no real change will occur.\n\nOf course, if you've already got a big house and lots of money, \"no real change\" is what you'd probably like to see.", "id": "t1_ca83pzr", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "inoffensive1", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1f9ff9", "score": 7, "retrieved_on": 1430996720, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ca83pzr", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1369834463", "ups": 7, "distinguished": null}

When a bank has more deposits (i.e. when the supply of bank deposits are greater), banks will loan out more money, and at lower rates. This means that more firms will be able to more cheaply take out loans for investment and expanding their businesses (not to mention that consumers, such as those looking to buy homes or other expensive things can also get money cheaper). \n\nHowever, if you take those loanable deposits and you give them to people that will buy consumer goods with them, it will be more difficult, and more expensive, for entrepreneurs to get loans to either create businesses or expand them, discouraging growth. This is not necessarily a bad thing: after all, while investment can expand output in the long run, it is purchasing and consuming goods (e.g. food, video games, books, tv's, etc.) that provides the population with utility/satisfaction/happiness. \n\nEssentially, my main point is that while increasing consumption (with the inevitable trade-off in investment) may increase happiness in the short run as people can buy more stuff, in the long run, it limits investment, which limits economic growth, or the amount of stuff we can make (and buy) in the future.

If money doesn't transfer hands, then it is not being used effectively. This means that in an economy where nobody is spending, raising the minimum wage is a very bad idea.

Austrian Economics actually doesn't do justice with the science, Praxeology on the other hand is a much better term.

But critiquing the conclusions(i.e. that 'we NEED the govt') is like imagine if medical sciences tells you that smoking is bad for your health and you critique medical sciences by talking about how much impossibile it would be for you to live your life without smoking.\n\nWhether or not you need government is not going to prove or disprove Austrian Economics.
