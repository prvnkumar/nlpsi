{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1t3hme", "selftext": "&gt; Specifically the idea that low wage work is supposed to suck\n\nSee, that's a fundamental misunderstanding of the actual conservative position.  It's not that low wage work is supposed to suck, it's that jobs should be part of the supply and demand curve.\n\nA job that requires minimal skill, minimal education, and minimal intelligence, contributing minimal value to anyone, should *not* be paid more than minimal wages.\n\n\nWhen it comes down to it, every job should be paid slightly less than the opportunity cost of the customer doing it themself.  If, for example, mowing your lawn would take you half an hour, and your time is worth $20/hr, then it doesn't make sense to pay someone else any more than $10 to do it, even if it takes that person 3 hours to do the same amount &amp; quality of work.  Anything beyond that is charity, and might as well be called that.\n\n&gt; Are we expected to move to an only skilled economy except for teenagers? \n\n...kind of, yes.  Either skilled, or tolerant.  There's nothing terribly skillful about garbage collection, but most people are unwilling to do it.  As a result, I understand it to be a surprisingly well paying job.\n\n&gt; If it shakes out 40% of the economy is service work, do we just accept that 40% of Americans have to have their life \"suck\" intrinsically?\n\nWhy do you presuppose that service work is not worth enough money to make their life not \"suck\"?  I am perfectly willing to pay a restaurant, from the cooks, to the wait staff, to the busers, a decent amount of money for the experience of eating at their restaurant, because that experience (and food) is worth more to me than the cost of that experience.  All of those are \"service\" jobs...\n\nFurther, much of it is skilled labor.  Cooking? A skill. The ability to adjust to the mood and temperament of many different guests, often concurrently?  A skill.  The ability to organize the restaurant and make everything flow smoothly?  A skill. \n\nUnder the conservative ideal, those who are particularly skilled will be rewarded with some form of improved compensation, or they will move to a competitor who *will* compensate them better.\n\n---\n\nAnother thing that isn't covered above is the idea that people have the ability to do better, to do things that are worth more than that which would only earn them minimum wage.

The important part is it's possible for all who put in the work to succeed.\n\nThe conservative stance argues for the first point well, any one person from either universe can succeed, but does not address why they believe Universe B over Universe A is the result of removing welfare and government intervention. \n\nI'm skeptical of their beliefs on the matter because Universe A is closer to what the economy looks like now, and the belief that many jobs shouldn't pay enough to live on.

For the purposes of this discussion, I'm limiting it to state-wide and higher elections as local elections often work somewhat differently.\n\nAs /u/urnbabyurn pointed out, it would be nearly impossible for a single person or even small group of people to push enough fake votes to actually sway an election. The actual amount of work required would be enormous and likely beyond the scale of a single person or small group. It would also require knowledge of the voter rolls themselves; who is eligible to vote but hasn't voted already and who won't vote. You can cast a provisional ballot under any name you want but those ballots have to be evaluated by the registrar's office before they're officially counted to be considered \"valid votes.\" You can fill out provisional ballots until your fingers fall off, if they're found to be fraudulent they won't ever make it into the final tally.\n\nAgain they could go in and fill out ballots under legitimate voter's names but again they'd have to know these names in advance and if that person had already voted or wasn't planing on showing up to vote. Which, barring omnipotence, would be impossible information to get.\n\nYou could have insiders rigging polls with a huge ring of people but this runs into the problem again that you'd need to fudge so many votes across such huge areas that you just couldn't do it unless you had massive cooperation among thousands of different people. It would depend on each one of those people remaining totally silent in a monumental conspiracy for ultimately no real gain (more on that later).\n\nIronically, the system being as fucked up as it is in a way saves it from this kind of fraud. The Presidential election is a prime example with the Electoral College. In elections where there are states or districts that are \"winner take all\" (if you get 51% of the vote, you win the vote(s) for that area) they're often heavily gerrymandered such that a particular party wins by a landslide pretty much regardless of who they put on the ticket. This means if you want to rig the election through voter fraud as the party not in power, you'd have to do exponentially more work just to catch up to the incumbent party. And a massive un-expected win in a normally other-party stronghold with wonky turnout numbers is virtually guaranteed to be investigated.\n\nThink of it like counterfeiting pennies. Yes, pennies are legal tender and counterfeiting them is illegal. However nobody does it because the benefit from doing so is exponentially less than the work you'll put into it and the risk you have to take to accomplish it that it isn't worth it.\n\nContinuing from above, election rigging isn't really a thing because there's no *need* to.\n\nFor starters, the parties can already legally do this. Gerrymandering is, essentially, legalized election rigging and it's rampant. CGP Grey made a great [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mky11UJb9AY) that explains this in greater detail.\n\nIt's also not needed because most political figures are going to vote the same way regardless of who they are. They'll fight over hot-button social issues that don't really mean much of anything but the vast majority will obey the wishes of the private interests that fund their campaigns and effectively put them into power.

They might *explain* their attitudes in terms of policy because that's more socially acceptable than saying, \"I'm a partisan\" or \"I'm a bigot,\" but in reality it's something other than policy that drives most people's opinions.\n\nI wouldn't say racial attitudes are a major factor for most people -- partisanship is far more powerful -- but it's certainly a factor with substantial empirical support that can hardly be ignored, and these would probably affect opinions toward Obama more than almost any president in history.", "id": "t1_cclmgoy", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Doctor_Worm", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cclm4fq", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429235551, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1380996050, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1npbvz", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cclmgoy", "author_flair_text": "[PhD Student: Political Science][Center-Left]", "created_utc": "1380995298", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cckzu43", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429235709, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1npbvz", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cclm4fq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1380994190", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cckxwuk", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1429246317, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1npbvz", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cckzu43", "author_flair_text": "[PhD Student: Political Science][Center-Left]", "created_utc": "1380904082", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cckvw8l", "score": -3, "retrieved_on": 1429247273, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1npbvz", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cckxwuk", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1380899041", "ups": -3, "distinguished": null}

(Further information implied, but to make it explicit: 2 seats, 5 candidates)\n\nA vote in approval voting isn't meant to be a list of the winners you'd like to see. It's a set of candidates you choose to support after considering the risk and potential benefit of doing so. A single approval ballot is largely useless by itself, but when the full set of ballots is considered, the results should give you insight not only into the preferences of the voting population as a whole, but also the relative strength of those preferences.\n\n\n&gt;And with Single Seat elections, that would be even worse, because there would be no chance that their approval of candidate N could result in both A (their primary candidate) and N both winning. In other words, without some method of expressing the relative approval of candidates, by expressing your contingency preference, you could cause your primary candidate to lose when not having done so would have resulted in them winning. They'd be losing to your contingency preference, certainly, but that's still losing.\n\nApproval voting has an incentive to vote for fewer candidates, for fear that voting for too many will cause a less preferred approved candidate to defeat a more preferred one. At the same time, it has an incentive to vote for additional candidates, for fear that voting for too few will allow a more preferred disapproved candidate to be defeated by a less preferred disapproved candidate. Approval and disapproval are equally powerful, and any strategy that applies to one applies to the other as well.\n\n&gt;That's the primary reason I dislike Approval voting. Is it better than FPTP? Yes (even if it does trend towards similar results). Is it better than one where your ranked preferences are taken into account (STV/IRV, Range, etc)? No.\n\nIf approval voting _were_ to degenerate into FPTP somehow, it would degenerate into FPTP _without a two party system_. The favorite betrayal criterion means that voting only for the lesser of two evils is _never_ a rational decision. Even if every voter only votes for their favorite, and one of two major parties, a two party system still wouldn't be stable, because a major party that would win with 51% under FPTP can easily be defeated by a third party that is the first choice of 52% of voters under approval.\n\nAlso, in range voting, A2 B1 C0 isn't really safe if you don't want B to defeat A. It just makes it less likely that you'll be allowing that outcome. I'm pretty sure the expected outcome would be the same if you were to vote for B conditional on a coin flip in approval voting. Range and approval do satisfy the participation criterion though, so you'll always be better off than if you didn't vote. Incidentally, you can't say that about IRV.\n\n.\n\nThis isn't really a response to anything in particular, but if you have three equally viable candidates who are known to be equally viable, and A supporters are going to bullet vote for A, there are two possibilities that seem likely.\n\nIf there's more overlap between B supporters and C supporters than between either group and A supporters, A is probably dissimilar enough from B and C to cause both B and C supporters to approve of both candidates, for fear that A will win.

(Further information implied, but to make it explicit: 2 seats, 5 candidates)\n\nA vote in approval voting isn't meant to be a list of the winners you'd like to see. It's a set of candidates you choose to support after considering the risk and potential benefit of doing so. A single approval ballot is largely useless by itself, but when the full set of ballots is considered, the results should give you insight not only into the preferences of the voting population as a whole, but also the relative strength of those preferences.\n\n\n&gt;And with Single Seat elections, that would be even worse, because there would be no chance that their approval of candidate N could result in both A (their primary candidate) and N both winning.

They'd be losing to your contingency preference, certainly, but that's still losing.\n\nApproval voting has an incentive to vote for fewer candidates, for fear that voting for too many will cause a less preferred approved candidate to defeat a more preferred one. At the same time, it has an incentive to vote for additional candidates, for fear that voting for too few will allow a more preferred disapproved candidate to be defeated by a less preferred disapproved candidate. Approval and disapproval are equally powerful, and any strategy that applies to one applies to the other as well.\n\n&gt;That's the primary reason I dislike Approval voting. Is it better than FPTP? Yes (even if it does trend towards similar results). Is it better than one where your ranked preferences are taken into account (STV/IRV, Range, etc)? No.\n\nIf approval voting _were_ to degenerate into FPTP somehow, it would degenerate into FPTP _without a two party system_. The favorite betrayal criterion means that voting only for the lesser of two evils is _never_ a rational decision. Even if every voter only votes for their favorite, and one of two major parties, a two party system still wouldn't be stable, because a major party that would win with 51% under FPTP can easily be defeated by a third party that is the first choice of 52% of voters under approval.\n\nAlso, in range voting, A2 B1 C0 isn't really safe if you don't want B to defeat A. It just makes it less likely that you'll be allowing that outcome. I'm pretty sure the expected outcome would be the same if you were to vote for B conditional on a coin flip in approval voting. Range and approval do satisfy the participation criterion though, so you'll always be better off than if you didn't vote. Incidentally, you can't say that about IRV.\n\n.\n\nThis isn't really a response to anything in particular, but if you have three equally viable candidates who are known to be equally viable, and A supporters are going to bullet vote for A, there are two possibilities that seem likely.\n\nIf there's more overlap between B supporters and C supporters than between either group and A supporters, A is probably dissimilar enough from B and C to cause both B and C supporters to approve of both candidates, for fear that A will win.

(Further information implied, but to make it explicit: 2 seats, 5 candidates)\n\nA vote in approval voting isn't meant to be a list of the winners you'd like to see. It's a set of candidates you choose to support after considering the risk and potential benefit of doing so. A single approval ballot is largely useless by itself, but when the full set of ballots is considered, the results should give you insight not only into the preferences of the voting population as a whole, but also the relative strength of those preferences.\n\n\n&gt;And with Single Seat elections, that would be even worse, because there would be no chance that their approval of candidate N could result in both A (their primary candidate) and N both winning. In other words, without some method of expressing the relative approval of candidates, by expressing your contingency preference, you could cause your primary candidate to lose when not having done so would have resulted in them winning. They'd be losing to your contingency preference, certainly, but that's still losing.\n\nApproval voting has an incentive to vote for fewer candidates, for fear that voting for too many will cause a less preferred approved candidate to defeat a more preferred one. At the same time, it has an incentive to vote for additional candidates, for fear that voting for too few will allow a more preferred disapproved candidate to be defeated by a less preferred disapproved candidate. Approval and disapproval are equally powerful, and any strategy that applies to one applies to the other as well.\n\n&gt;That's the primary reason I dislike Approval voting. Is it better than FPTP? Yes (even if it does trend towards similar results). Is it better than one where your ranked preferences are taken into account (STV/IRV, Range, etc)? No.\n\nIf approval voting _were_ to degenerate into FPTP somehow, it would degenerate into FPTP _without a two party system_. The favorite betrayal criterion means that voting only for the lesser of two evils is _never_ a rational decision. Even if every voter only votes for their favorite, and one of two major parties, a two party system still wouldn't be stable, because a major party that would win with 51% under FPTP can easily be defeated by a third party that is the first choice of 52% of voters under approval.\n\nAlso, in range voting, A2 B1 C0 isn't really safe if you don't want B to defeat A. It just makes it less likely that you'll be allowing that outcome. I'm pretty sure the expected outcome would be the same if you were to vote for B conditional on a coin flip in approval voting. Range and approval do satisfy the participation criterion though, so you'll always be better off than if you didn't vote. Incidentally, you can't say that about IRV.\n\n.\n\nThis isn't really a response to anything in particular, but if you have three equally viable candidates who are known to be equally viable, and A supporters are going to bullet vote for A, there are two possibilities that seem likely.\n\nIf there's more overlap between B supporters and C supporters than between either group and A supporters, A is probably dissimilar enough from B and C to cause both B and C supporters to approve of both candidates, for fear that A will win. A should lose in this scenario, and probably will.\n\nIf overlap between any two groups is roughly the same as that of any other two groups, you'll probably see a lot of bullet voting, but vote splitting will be symmetric if everybody is using optimal strategy, so it doesn't matter. If A has more bullet voters than anyone else, that actually implies that they're more _popular_ than anyone else in this scenario, even if symmetric vote splitting means they only get 34% approval. As such, A should win, and probably will.\n\nIf the candidates aren't equally viable, you can end up with a situation where the supporters of the two front runners all have an incentive to bullet vote, which can potentially allow a third candidate that would be the last choice of both groups to win, but this seems unlikely given that more than two-thirds of voters should have approved at least one front runner if the perception of viability was uniform.", "edited": 1378603620, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1lup3k", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cc3veak", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1378602930", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cc3h6eb", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429557724, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cc3n5nq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1378575894", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cc3g5e0", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429560586, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;I don't object to speculation, I object to you assuming things with no evidence what so ever, because that allows you to persist in your delusion that what happened was not a normal, rational decision.\n\nI'm pretty sure I never meant to suggest that my assumption was likely to be correct, only that I needed more information before I could do any better. That said, I'm not an impartial judge of my own meaning at this point, and the assumption proved inaccurate, so I apologize.\n\nOne further clarification: Voting for only one candidate is absolutely normal and rational behavior if certain conditions are met. _Everybody_ voting for only one candidate each would be extremely abnormal, and almost certainly irrational for some subset of the voters. If you aren't claiming that approval voting tends to give results effectively indistinguishable from those given by FPTP, I can move on.\n\n&gt;&gt;How many candidates were there?\n\n&gt;About twice as many as there were seats.\n\nWell, that was unexpected. I'm mostly familiar with approval voting as a single-winner system. The favorite betrayal criterion obviously still applies, but I'm not completely certain how optimal strategy might be different, if at all.\n\n&gt;&gt;What were the final results of the election?\n\n&gt;Candidate A was seated\n\nI was hoping for actual vote percentages. Generally speaking, I'm pretty sure having too few or too many candidates with majority support is evidence that some voters didn't maximize their influence, which may or may not be a fault of the voting system.\n\n&gt;&gt;Did voters object to the outcome, or regret the way that they voted?\n\n&gt;No, they in fact had their behavior reinforced by the achievement of the desired result.\n\nI'm not just talking about voters who bullet voted for A.

A supporters used a strategy that was good for getting A elected, but useless for influencing who got replaced, or who would win if A lost. That a lot of people bullet voted for A despite this implies that electing A was more important to them than other considerations, which supports the hypothesis that A should have been elected.

Incidentally, you can't say that about IRV.\n\n.\n\nThis isn't really a response to anything in particular, but if you have three equally viable candidates who are known to be equally viable, and A supporters are going to bullet vote for A, there are two possibilities that seem likely.\n\nIf there's more overlap between B supporters and C supporters than between either group and A supporters, A is probably dissimilar enough from B and C to cause both B and C supporters to approve of both candidates, for fear that A will win. A should lose in this scenario, and probably will.\n\nIf overlap between any two groups is roughly the same as that of any other two groups, you'll probably see a lot of bullet voting, but vote splitting will be symmetric if everybody is using optimal strategy, so it doesn't matter. If A has more bullet voters than anyone else, that actually implies that they're more _popular_ than anyone else in this scenario, even if symmetric vote splitting means they only get 34% approval. As such, A should win, and probably will.\n\nIf the candidates aren't equally viable, you can end up with a situation where the supporters of the two front runners all have an incentive to bullet vote, which can potentially allow a third candidate that would be the last choice of both groups to win, but this seems unlikely given that more than two-thirds of voters should have approved at least one front runner if the perception of viability was uniform.", "edited": 1378603620, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1lup3k", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cc3veak", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1378602930", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cc3h6eb", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429557724, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cc3n5nq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1378575894", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cc3g5e0", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429560586, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;I don't object to speculation, I object to you assuming things with no evidence what so ever, because that allows you to persist in your delusion that what happened was not a normal, rational decision.\n\nI'm pretty sure I never meant to suggest that my assumption was likely to be correct, only that I needed more information before I could do any better. That said, I'm not an impartial judge of my own meaning at this point, and the assumption proved inaccurate, so I apologize.\n\nOne further clarification: Voting for only one candidate is absolutely normal and rational behavior if certain conditions are met. _Everybody_ voting for only one candidate each would be extremely abnormal, and almost certainly irrational for some subset of the voters. If you aren't claiming that approval voting tends to give results effectively indistinguishable from those given by FPTP, I can move on.\n\n&gt;&gt;How many candidates were there?\n\n&gt;About twice as many as there were seats.\n\nWell, that was unexpected. I'm mostly familiar with approval voting as a single-winner system. The favorite betrayal criterion obviously still applies, but I'm not completely certain how optimal strategy might be different, if at all.\n\n&gt;&gt;What were the final results of the election?\n\n&gt;Candidate A was seated\n\nI was hoping for actual vote percentages. Generally speaking, I'm pretty sure having too few or too many candidates with majority support is evidence that some voters didn't maximize their influence, which may or may not be a fault of the voting system.\n\n&gt;&gt;Did voters object to the outcome, or regret the way that they voted?\n\n&gt;No, they in fact had their behavior reinforced by the achievement of the desired result.\n\nI'm not just talking about voters who bullet voted for A. If A won despite having minority approval, that's a sign that other voters didn't compromise enough.\n\n&gt;Experience with people who figured out how to game the system you seem to think would never result in something that has happened\n\nAgain, near universal use of bullet voting is what I don't recognize as realistic. A supporters used a strategy that was good for getting A elected, but useless for influencing who got replaced, or who would win if A lost. That a lot of people bullet voted for A despite this implies that electing A was more important to them than other considerations, which supports the hypothesis that A should have been elected.

(Further information implied, but to make it explicit: 2 seats, 5 candidates)\n\nA vote in approval voting isn't meant to be a list of the winners you'd like to see. It's a set of candidates you choose to support after considering the risk and potential benefit of doing so. A single approval ballot is largely useless by itself, but when the full set of ballots is considered, the results should give you insight not only into the preferences of the voting population as a whole, but also the relative strength of those preferences.\n\n\n&gt;And with Single Seat elections, that would be even worse, because there would be no chance that their approval of candidate N could result in both A (their primary candidate) and N both winning. In other words, without some method of expressing the relative approval of candidates, by expressing your contingency preference, you could cause your primary candidate to lose when not having done so would have resulted in them winning. They'd be losing to your contingency preference, certainly, but that's still losing.\n\nApproval voting has an incentive to vote for fewer candidates, for fear that voting for too many will cause a less preferred approved candidate to defeat a more preferred one. At the same time, it has an incentive to vote for additional candidates, for fear that voting for too few will allow a more preferred disapproved candidate to be defeated by a less preferred disapproved candidate. Approval and disapproval are equally powerful, and any strategy that applies to one applies to the other as well.\n\n&gt;That's the primary reason I dislike Approval voting. Is it better than FPTP? Yes (even if it does trend towards similar results). Is it better than one where your ranked preferences are taken into account (STV/IRV, Range, etc)? No.\n\nIf approval voting _were_ to degenerate into FPTP somehow, it would degenerate into FPTP _without a two party system_. The favorite betrayal criterion means that voting only for the lesser of two evils is _never_ a rational decision. Even if every voter only votes for their favorite, and one of two major parties, a two party system still wouldn't be stable, because a major party that would win with 51% under FPTP can easily be defeated by a third party that is the first choice of 52% of voters under approval.\n\nAlso, in range voting, A2 B1 C0 isn't really safe if you don't want B to defeat A. It just makes it less likely that you'll be allowing that outcome. I'm pretty sure the expected outcome would be the same if you were to vote for B conditional on a coin flip in approval voting. Range and approval do satisfy the participation criterion though, so you'll always be better off than if you didn't vote. Incidentally, you can't say that about IRV.\n\n.\n\nThis isn't really a response to anything in particular, but if you have three equally viable candidates who are known to be equally viable, and A supporters are going to bullet vote for A, there are two possibilities that seem likely.\n\nIf there's more overlap between B supporters and C supporters than between either group and A supporters, A is probably dissimilar enough from B and C to cause both B and C supporters to approve of both candidates, for fear that A will win. A should lose in this scenario, and probably will.\n\nIf overlap between any two groups is roughly the same as that of any other two groups, you'll probably see a lot of bullet voting, but vote splitting will be symmetric if everybody is using optimal strategy, so it doesn't matter. If A has more bullet voters than anyone else, that actually implies that they're more _popular_ than anyone else in this scenario, even if symmetric vote splitting means they only get 34% approval. As such, A should win, and probably will.\n\nIf the candidates aren't equally viable, you can end up with a situation where the supporters of the two front runners all have an incentive to bullet vote, which can potentially allow a third candidate that would be the last choice of both groups to win, but this seems unlikely given that more than two-thirds of voters should have approved at least one front runner if the perception of viability was uniform.", "edited": 1378603620, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1lup3k", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cc3veak", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1378602930", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cc3h6eb", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429557724, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cc3n5nq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1378575894", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cc3g5e0", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429560586, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;I don't object to speculation, I object to you assuming things with no evidence what so ever, because that allows you to persist in your delusion that what happened was not a normal, rational decision.\n\nI'm pretty sure I never meant to suggest that my assumption was likely to be correct, only that I needed more information before I could do any better. That said, I'm not an impartial judge of my own meaning at this point, and the assumption proved inaccurate, so I apologize.\n\nOne further clarification: Voting for only one candidate is absolutely normal and rational behavior if certain conditions are met. _Everybody_ voting for only one candidate each would be extremely abnormal, and almost certainly irrational for some subset of the voters. If you aren't claiming that approval voting tends to give results effectively indistinguishable from those given by FPTP, I can move on.\n\n&gt;&gt;How many candidates were there?\n\n&gt;About twice as many as there were seats.\n\nWell, that was unexpected. I'm mostly familiar with approval voting as a single-winner system. The favorite betrayal criterion obviously still applies, but I'm not completely certain how optimal strategy might be different, if at all.\n\n&gt;&gt;What were the final results of the election?\n\n&gt;Candidate A was seated\n\nI was hoping for actual vote percentages. Generally speaking, I'm pretty sure having too few or too many candidates with majority support is evidence that some voters didn't maximize their influence, which may or may not be a fault of the voting system.\n\n&gt;&gt;Did voters object to the outcome, or regret the way that they voted?\n\n&gt;No, they in fact had their behavior reinforced by the achievement of the desired result.\n\nI'm not just talking about voters who bullet voted for A.

A supporters used a strategy that was good for getting A elected, but useless for influencing who got replaced, or who would win if A lost. That a lot of people bullet voted for A despite this implies that electing A was more important to them than other considerations, which supports the hypothesis that A should have been elected.

If the US started spending less there is nothing to indicate that the EU would have to start spending more. The US chose to spend $3 trillion dollars invading Iraq, and most EU countries chose not to spend anything (or to spend a lot less) on that debacle which had absolutely nothing to do with *defence*. \n\nThere is no one currently threatening to invade Europe, or even reasonably capable of it without using nuclear weapons which would be a zero-sum game, and military analysts are in agreement that the EU force is currently modern, well-equipped, and fully capable of defending Europe. \n\nRegarding the conjecture that money which could go towards weapons purchases is currently being used to buy health care, the US currently [spends more on health expenditures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_%28PPP%29_per_capita) per person than every other country, including every single country in the EU.

But that would be a pretty remarkable target to hit.\n\nBut figuring prices is not so simple as just determining whether people have the same amount of spending money in total.  For instance: if you've changed the distribution of that spending money, it's probably going to be spent on a different set of items.\n\n&gt;Given that the people we're nominally trying to help by raising the minimum wage are those most severely impacted by an increase in prices and the most likely to be laid off because their labor isn't worth the cost of keeping them employed at the new minimum wage... Isn't that a lose lose situation? \n\nIf they'll *actually* be laid off.  That's what a very simple model of the labor market suggests, but we have evidence that the employment effect is actually minimal (at least for changes to the minimum wage around the levels that the US has played with in recent decades).  The strongest theory seems to be that employers act like a monopsony (the buyers' version of a monopoly) in the labor market, and so they're actually paying wages below the level that they would in a competitive market.  Minimum wages, therefore, don't actually affect the number of employees that they hire, they just eat a slight reduction to their marginal profits in order to keep producing at the same level.\n\nBut, again, that behavior depends heavily on the specific circumstances of an economy.\n\n&gt;If the economy is at less than full employment, that means that the labor of the unemployed is deemed by the employers to be less than the cost to employ them, and no one will be done any service by increasing the cost of that employment.\n\nNah, when you're at less than full employment, it means that there's slack in consumer demand *as well* as potential production.

That's what a very simple model of the labor market suggests, but we have evidence that the employment effect is actually minimal (at least for changes to the minimum wage around the levels that the US has played with in recent decades).  The strongest theory seems to be that employers act like a monopsony (the buyers' version of a monopoly) in the labor market, and so they're actually paying wages below the level that they would in a competitive market.  Minimum wages, therefore, don't actually affect the number of employees that they hire, they just eat a slight reduction to their marginal profits in order to keep producing at the same level.\n\nBut, again, that behavior depends heavily on the specific circumstances of an economy.\n\n&gt;If the economy is at less than full employment, that means that the labor of the unemployed is deemed by the employers to be less than the cost to employ them, and no one will be done any service by increasing the cost of that employment.\n\nNah, when you're at less than full employment, it means that there's slack in consumer demand *as well* as potential production.

Smaller constituencies.  I'm a fan of increasing the house to somewhere in excess of 1600 members, such that people could actually know, have interacted with, or have an indirect (at worst) connection to their representative.  That would allow for true grassroots candidates to win based on campaigning, rather than campaign contributions, and allow for an actually, y'know, *representative* house of representatives.\n3. In as much as it would not unduely undermine point 2, multiseat elections are far superior, if only because they are that much harder to gerrymander.  If you're making 1 seat districts, you can create safe (read: extremist) seats by splitting a 50%/50% districts into two 55%/45% districts.  On the other hand, if you have a 2 seat district, you need to gerrymander the districts to be much closer to 70%/30% to ensure the district minority is never heard from.  In a 3 seat district, even a 26% minority would be given a voice.\n\nPoints 1 &amp; 3 lend themselves to more centrist, less partisan/extremist candidates winning (including minority party candidates), and point 2 allows for actual representative democracy, which we haven't had for... quite a while.\n\nAnd as long as I'm talking about voting reform, I'd like to see the Electoral College stay, but with the overwhelming majority (read: all) states choosing their electors proportionally, rather than winner take all.  If a candidate wins 50.001% of florida's vote, for example, they shouldn't get all 29 electors, but instead get at most 15 (51.72%).  In 2012, more people voted for Romney in the state of california than voted for any presidential candidate in 44 other states (plus DC), yet that fact was not represented in the electoral college.  Likewise with Obama in Texas vs 39 states (plus DC)  If the states allocated their Electors proportionally, Romney would have gotten about 20 electors from California, and Obama would have gotten about 16 electors from Texas, which is more than the electors provided by any one of 44 other states (or DC) or 42 other states (or DC), respectively.", "id": "t1_cawmt5e", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "PerspicaciousPedant", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cavyn8p", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430572020, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1hmeeq", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cawmt5e", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1373059787", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cavy2x2", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430583622, "controversiality": 0, "body": "What would be a better voting system?", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1hmeeq", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cavyn8p", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1372963069", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cavxwp1", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430583887, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1hmeeq", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cavy2x2", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1372961288", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cavxs9k", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430583969, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I agree with you that currently we have too many selfish politicians but I guess I am just more optimistic that one day we will have less of them because more people will vote out those politicians.

Someone's view of the welfare system is not indicative of their ability to responsibly carry a firearm. What if someone donates a certain percentage of their income to charity?

There were 402,914 concealed carry permit holders in Texas in 2010, for about 2% of the population. In 2011, concealed carry permit holders were only convicted of [.2%](http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/RSD/CHL/Reports/ConvictionRatesReport2011.pdf) of the crimes. That means concealed carry permit holders are literally ten times less likely to be convicted of any crime (not just violent crimes) than someone in the general public.

To me, I don't think he's talking about people who dissent the way government is run the way you are dissenting. He wouldn't have put that in between calls to question government and statements that we're not doing as well as we could if he didn't find it acceptable to question the government, which as you said (if interpreted the way you are interpreting) would clash with that statement. \n\nHe is a very intelligent man. These speeches go through a huge review process. He would NOT make such a careless mistake, nor would his speech writers. This tells me that it was very intentional, and meant to be interpreted the way I myself, and literally every other person I know who was at this commencement has interpreted the speech (and I have a fairly diverse group of friends politically, a side effect of living in Ohio).\n\nHowever, if you view it from the standpoint that I said, it sounds quite clear that he was saying \"don't listen to the men with the tinfoil hats,\" essentially. There is a big difference between dissent from the opposition party/moderates/even liberals against government which is well rationalized, and the \"HOLY CRAP AMERICA IS GOING TO SHIT WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!!!!\" crowd. I believe the point he was making is, there always have been, and always will be people in that camp, and it is neither warranted nor helpful. He's not saying our system is perfect. In fact, three different times in the speech he says our system is below where it should be, and we need to work on that as a country. His point is that you **cannot** simply say \"well it's the elected officials job to do it, I want no part of it after because that's their job.\" He's reminding people that the civic duty of Americans isn't supposed to stop at the occasional vote, which is why he rather effectively used that George W. Bush quote. He's reminding people it's their job to pick up the phones or get on their email and write their representatives. It's everyone's job to keep informed and make sure their peers are informed. This angle is fully supporting your harpings on the failings of government. This speech was asking more people to be like you. (Unless you're in the ZOMG AMERICA IS A SHITHOLE AND FALLING APART AND IT'S ALL OBAMAS FAULT SINGLE HANDEDLY AND OMG WE\"RE ALL GOING TO DIE camp, which I sincerely doubt and sincerely hope you are not). \n\n2) I don't think it's fair to make the statements which you made and include words like \"everybody\" and \"most people.\" This is neither factual, fair, nor the kind of statement which can be backed up by statistics. America is, and always has been very close to even split. If anything, the country as a whole is more left leaning by American standards, although to be fair, America as a country is conservative. This is not because the country is full of republicans, it's because the American standard of \"left\" is what the rest of the industrialized world considers \"middle\" or even \"slightly right.\" The \"right\" in this country is what much of the rest of the world calls \"extremely right\" or even \"off the deep end right.\" Interestingly, what most of Europe or other developed nations consider \"left\" would be considered \"off the deep end left\" in America to most Americans.\n\nHowever, the point of bringing all of that up is that most Americans are not pissed at Obama. Just yesterday someone posted that pew research data which showed where the partisan line is, and a significantly larger portion of the non-voting or non-politically active crowd, when polled, said they would vote left on issues if they were made to vote. When you adjust these statistics, it's amazing how much more \"American left\" the country becomes on all issues. \n\nThe group who really are a small minority in American are 3rd party members, especially libertarians. If you spend lots of time on reddit, you would swear American is an 80% libertarian paradise where the libertarians are all being oppressed and kept silent. While it is true that the system is unfairly stacked against 3rd party, in no way is there data, from any source, to provide evidence of any one of the 3rd parties to being of statistical significance. This is unfortunate, and I would love to see the libertarian party replace the republican party, but reddit is not all of America. The numbers are currently nowhere close to \"there.\"\n\nIt seems like the libertarian group are the ones taking the biggest stink with Obama and trying to tie him to the IRS scandal to the point of him actually orchestrating it, and I'm sorry if I don't consider a few seconds of out-of-context-speech definitive evidence of this. I don't even consider it fringe evidence. I consider it grasping at straws. I am not saying you are a libertarian (though you might be, it doesn't really matter), rather that I don't think that it's acceptable to twist this speech into something it wasn't.\n\nThe only way one could assume that this speech was telling people \"do not question big brother, he is here to protect you\" would be if you assume that Obama and his speech writers are so stupid that they would leave a blatant contradiction in a major speech (which I would put large money on not being true), or if you choose to absolutely only see the speech subjectively, from a pre-determined \"I don't like him and secretly want him to be saying this\" standpoint. \n\nThere's just no way to dissect and organize the speech from an intelligent and objective viewpoint and not realize that these parts in question are working in counterpoint, and are not at odds with one another.

To me, I don't think he's talking about people who dissent the way government is run the way you are dissenting. He wouldn't have put that in between calls to question government and statements that we're not doing as well as we could if he didn't find it acceptable to question the government, which as you said (if interpreted the way you are interpreting) would clash with that statement. \n\nHe is a very intelligent man. These speeches go through a huge review process. He would NOT make such a careless mistake, nor would his speech writers. This tells me that it was very intentional, and meant to be interpreted the way I myself, and literally every other person I know who was at this commencement has interpreted the speech (and I have a fairly diverse group of friends politically, a side effect of living in Ohio).\n\nHowever, if you view it from the standpoint that I said, it sounds quite clear that he was saying \"don't listen to the men with the tinfoil hats,\" essentially. There is a big difference between dissent from the opposition party/moderates/even liberals against government which is well rationalized, and the \"HOLY CRAP AMERICA IS GOING TO SHIT WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!!!!\" crowd. I believe the point he was making is, there always have been, and always will be people in that camp, and it is neither warranted nor helpful. He's not saying our system is perfect. In fact, three different times in the speech he says our system is below where it should be, and we need to work on that as a country. His point is that you **cannot** simply say \"well it's the elected officials job to do it, I want no part of it after because that's their job.\" He's reminding people that the civic duty of Americans isn't supposed to stop at the occasional vote, which is why he rather effectively used that George W. Bush quote. He's reminding people it's their job to pick up the phones or get on their email and write their representatives. It's everyone's job to keep informed and make sure their peers are informed. This angle is fully supporting your harpings on the failings of government. This speech was asking more people to be like you. (Unless you're in the ZOMG AMERICA IS A SHITHOLE AND FALLING APART AND IT'S ALL OBAMAS FAULT SINGLE HANDEDLY AND OMG WE\"RE ALL GOING TO DIE camp, which I sincerely doubt and sincerely hope you are not). \n\n2) I don't think it's fair to make the statements which you made and include words like \"everybody\" and \"most people.\" This is neither factual, fair, nor the kind of statement which can be backed up by statistics. America is, and always has been very close to even split. If anything, the country as a whole is more left leaning by American standards, although to be fair, America as a country is conservative. This is not because the country is full of republicans, it's because the American standard of \"left\" is what the rest of the industrialized world considers \"middle\" or even \"slightly right.\" The \"right\" in this country is what much of the rest of the world calls \"extremely right\" or even \"off the deep end right.\" Interestingly, what most of Europe or other developed nations consider \"left\" would be considered \"off the deep end left\" in America to most Americans.\n\nHowever, the point of bringing all of that up is that most Americans are not pissed at Obama. Just yesterday someone posted that pew research data which showed where the partisan line is, and a significantly larger portion of the non-voting or non-politically active crowd, when polled, said they would vote left on issues if they were made to vote. When you adjust these statistics, it's amazing how much more \"American left\" the country becomes on all issues. \n\nThe group who really are a small minority in American are 3rd party members, especially libertarians. If you spend lots of time on reddit, you would swear American is an 80% libertarian paradise where the libertarians are all being oppressed and kept silent. While it is true that the system is unfairly stacked against 3rd party, in no way is there data, from any source, to provide evidence of any one of the 3rd parties to being of statistical significance. This is unfortunate, and I would love to see the libertarian party replace the republican party, but reddit is not all of America. The numbers are currently nowhere close to \"there.\"\n\nIt seems like the libertarian group are the ones taking the biggest stink with Obama and trying to tie him to the IRS scandal to the point of him actually orchestrating it, and I'm sorry if I don't consider a few seconds of out-of-context-speech definitive evidence of this. I don't even consider it fringe evidence. I consider it grasping at straws. I am not saying you are a libertarian (though you might be, it doesn't really matter), rather that I don't think that it's acceptable to twist this speech into something it wasn't.\n\nThe only way one could assume that this speech was telling people \"do not question big brother, he is here to protect you\" would be if you assume that Obama and his speech writers are so stupid that they would leave a blatant contradiction in a major speech (which I would put large money on not being true), or if you choose to absolutely only see the speech subjectively, from a pre-determined \"I don't like him and secretly want him to be saying this\" standpoint. \n\nThere's just no way to dissect and organize the speech from an intelligent and objective viewpoint and not realize that these parts in question are working in counterpoint, and are not at odds with one another.

I just re-watched the speech, seeing it for the second time, and I cannot find anything which supports your statement unless you pull 45 seconds of the 26 minute speech out of context and ignore what surrounds it.\n\nThe speech actually calls for the literal opposite of what you are saying. He actually specifically is asking people to know who they are voting for, what those people stand for, what they are doing, and if you disagree, say something about it, either in person or with your vote.\n\nThe only part which could POSSIBLY support your point is around the 16 minute mark, when he says that there are people who are extremists and that they should be ignored, and when you watch it in context, especially from the 10 minute mark on you notice that this actually just asking you to listen to informed, educated voices, and make your own opinion, and not to listen to some blogger or news correspondent as if their word is the gospel.\n\nI think that what is happening is people are pulling out 45 seconds of clip that, when out of context, meet their confirmation bias and ignore the other 25 minutes which essentially encourage people to be involved in the political process and help vote out people you think aren't holding up the ideals.\n\nNow, as for the scandals of the Obama administration, a few of them are newsworthy, but most aren't anything new nor exclusive to this administration. You point out Benghazi as if it's the only time in history something like that happened. I believe the statistic is that 12 such scandals happened under the Bush administration, but when one happens under Obama, it's a HUGE deal? It's only a big deal to many when a member of the opposition party happens to be in the executive branch. Perhaps the bigger concern should be that these things happen at all, which is a bipartisan problem, and the entire thesis of Obamas speech was \"class of 2013, help clean politics up so this sort of thing doesn't happen as often.\" Blaming the president as the exclusive cause of such things is childish and shows a lack of understanding of the American system. The president is not a king, and does not have 100% say on how the country runs. The president has become more of a figure head than was initially intended by the framers, thanks largely to Andrew Jackson, but that does not give them the level of power many believe them to have. In fact, I would argue that congress has significantly more power overall, and yet the president frequently gets the blame (just look at the fox news crowd claiming the president can control gas prices, or the liberal bloggers claiming that Bush was the only reason the economy tanked.)\n\nI'm not saying Obama is without fault, nor am I one of his 100% supporters, but at least in the case of this speech, I have a hard time finding anything to support the arguments against it. To me, all this says is that people who haven't heard the whole speech are pulling things out of context to support their cause and their claim themselves informed. The low level of views for the full speech in comparison to the level of news this is generating tells me the amount of informed discussion on this topic is at a minimum.\n\nAlso, I've basically said this many times over already, but considering one of his two thesis points was \"be informed who the man behind the iron curtain is,\" I can't help but laugh at the irony of you using that analogy, since it leads me to believe you haven't actually seen the speech in question, or at the very least, picked a particularly ironic analogy to use as to why this speech is \"bad.\"", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ca0w99c", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1368832313", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_ca0ppmv", "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1431122278, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1368864416, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ca0uch6", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1368826272", "ups": 4, "distinguished": null}

Such harassment apparently tended to consist of roughly a quarter's harassment and no impact on the non-profit status of the organizations in question.  Despite that, most rational people would likely acknowledge such things as pretty clear asshaberdashery, and liberals/democrats apparently raised a stink about it at the time.\n\nFast forward to ~2010, and the rise of the Tea Party, and there were a lot of non-profit political groups that organized themselves around the idea of smaller, less intrusive government being a patriotic goal.  Some number of these groups were subjected to extreme scruitiny, based on no more than buzzwords.  While other groups were given non-profit status fairly quickly (the bureaucratic standard small number of weeks/months), groups with the terms \"Tea Party\" or \"Patriot\" in their names were often stuck in limbo for as much as two years.\n\nDuring these two years, they were required to provide stupid and asinine documents, such as a list of names and addresses of attendants of meetings where there was no registration nor sign-in, synopses of books that the filers led them to form these groups, etc.  Basically the standard \"we're trying to make your life miserable because we don't like you\" bureaucratic nonsense, dialed up to 11.\n\n...and then, as the icing on the cake, when the various groups started complaining that they were being singled out and persecuted for their conservative beliefs, the IRS denied that such things were happening, effectively saying \"Do you believe how wild these conspiracy theories are?\"\n\nOnly last week, as a result of proceedings/for reasons I am unaware of, the IRS admitted that they maybe might have perhaps theoretically done exactly the sort of thing that they previously categorically denied doing (specifically, a broad abuse of power with a political bias).\n\n\nSo now there's a big hubbub because in the week following Mr Obama's commencement speech denouncing people who question the government, some of the allegations of government wrongdoing were admitted to be factual.\n\n**tl;dr:** The IRS persecuted organizations to a degree that would have made Joe McCarthy proud, based on political beliefs, lied about it, and then proved the conspiracy claims about government malfeasance true within a week of Mr Obama saying that such warnings should be dismissed out of hand.", "id": "t1_ca0i3be", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "PerspicaciousPedant", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_ca0irk7", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "BraveryDave", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_ca0i3be", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431127807, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Great response.

That isn't \"[securing] our God-given rights for all our citizens.\" \n\nAnd then there's the blatantly inaccurate statement that people like me, who will not hesitate to harp on the failings of government, \"suggest is that our brave, creative, unique experiment in self-rule is just a sham with which we can\u2019t be trusted.\"  That is complete *bullshit.*  When on a number of topics the population feels one way and the government enacts laws in direct contrast with the will of the people, that is *not* self governance.   That is governance by a ruling class that you and I do not realistically have an entry path into.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of us do not say, as the president claimed, that we should not be trusted with our own governance, but that those we trusted with our votes cannot be trusted.\n\nIndeed, in his very next point, Mr Obama explains why we *shouldn't* reject those questioning voices, how the government *is* separate from the people.  He acknowledges that lawmakers ignore the will of their constituents.  That undermines the entire premise of self government.  If someone can do that, and get reelected as an overwhelming majority of congress are, then we are not meaningfully self governed.\n\nThe problem with that one section of Mr Obama's speech is that he's calling out people who are asking for the exact sort of thing he claims he wants, and he ~~lies~~ misleads people to do it.", "id": "t1_ca1ahwp", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "PerspicaciousPedant", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ei7ok", "id": "t1_ca1e4o1", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "arksien", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I've put off responding to you for too long, and I now realize that I'm probably never going to respond to you properly, so I'll just say this\n\n&gt; There's just no way to dissect and organize the speech from an intelligent and objective viewpoint\n\nI don't believe that your view point is actually objective, given that you apparently refuse to believe that it's possible that Mr Obama did mean to call out people like me, despite the fact that all of the paranoia has recently been proven to *not* be completely bullshit, given the explicit statements by at least one member of congress that the White House specifically requested the ~~infinite~~ indefinite detention clause be put into the NDAA2012, etc.\n\nYour failure to question him, *especially* when he's criticizing people for decrying the government, which do *not* accurately represent the people as he seems to claim, makes me think you're *not* objective, or at least not thinking critically.  Personally, when someone doesn't question, doesn't think critically, I have to wonder if what they're doing actually qualifies as \"thinking\"  (note: I do not mean to imply anything negative about you; failure to properly think is human nature, and I fail on this regard all the time)", "id": "t1_caa5ro6", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "PerspicaciousPedant", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_ca1e4o1", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430961302, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ei7ok", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_caa5ro6", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1370107010", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_ca1ahwp", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431112743, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I respect your viewpoint and understand where you are coming from, and why you are there, however;\n\n1) I don't think you're the kind of person he was talking about, and if you look at the speech objectively I think it's plain to see he's encouraging the question of government, and specifically harping on the paranoid conspiracy theorists. To me, I don't think he's talking about people who dissent the way government is run the way you are dissenting. He wouldn't have put that in between calls to question government and statements that we're not doing as well as we could if he didn't find it acceptable to question the government, which as you said (if interpreted the way you are interpreting) would clash with that statement. \n\nHe is a very intelligent man. These speeches go through a huge review process. He would NOT make such a careless mistake, nor would his speech writers. This tells me that it was very intentional, and meant to be interpreted the way I myself, and literally every other person I know who was at this commencement has interpreted the speech (and I have a fairly diverse group of friends politically, a side effect of living in Ohio).\n\nHowever, if you view it from the standpoint that I said, it sounds quite clear that he was saying \"don't listen to the men with the tinfoil hats,\" essentially. There is a big difference between dissent from the opposition party/moderates/even liberals against government which is well rationalized, and the \"HOLY CRAP AMERICA IS GOING TO SHIT WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!!!!\" crowd. I believe the point he was making is, there always have been, and always will be people in that camp, and it is neither warranted nor helpful. He's not saying our system is perfect. In fact, three different times in the speech he says our system is below where it should be, and we need to work on that as a country. His point is that you **cannot** simply say \"well it's the elected officials job to do it, I want no part of it after because that's their job.\" He's reminding people that the civic duty of Americans isn't supposed to stop at the occasional vote, which is why he rather effectively used that George W. Bush quote. He's reminding people it's their job to pick up the phones or get on their email and write their representatives. It's everyone's job to keep informed and make sure their peers are informed. This angle is fully supporting your harpings on the failings of government. This speech was asking more people to be like you. (Unless you're in the ZOMG AMERICA IS A SHITHOLE AND FALLING APART AND IT'S ALL OBAMAS FAULT SINGLE HANDEDLY AND OMG WE\"RE ALL GOING TO DIE camp, which I sincerely doubt and sincerely hope you are not). \n\n2) I don't think it's fair to make the statements which you made and include words like \"everybody\" and \"most people.\" This is neither factual, fair, nor the kind of statement which can be backed up by statistics. America is, and always has been very close to even split. If anything, the country as a whole is more left leaning by American standards, although to be fair, America as a country is conservative. This is not because the country is full of republicans, it's because the American standard of \"left\" is what the rest of the industrialized world considers \"middle\" or even \"slightly right.\" The \"right\" in this country is what much of the rest of the world calls \"extremely right\" or even \"off the deep end right.\" Interestingly, what most of Europe or other developed nations consider \"left\" would be considered \"off the deep end left\" in America to most Americans.\n\nHowever, the point of bringing all of that up is that most Americans are not pissed at Obama. Just yesterday someone posted that pew research data which showed where the partisan line is, and a significantly larger portion of the non-voting or non-politically active crowd, when polled, said they would vote left on issues if they were made to vote. When you adjust these statistics, it's amazing how much more \"American left\" the country becomes on all issues. \n\nThe group who really are a small minority in American are 3rd party members, especially libertarians. If you spend lots of time on reddit, you would swear American is an 80% libertarian paradise where the libertarians are all being oppressed and kept silent. While it is true that the system is unfairly stacked against 3rd party, in no way is there data, from any source, to provide evidence of any one of the 3rd parties to being of statistical significance. This is unfortunate, and I would love to see the libertarian party replace the republican party, but reddit is not all of America. The numbers are currently nowhere close to \"there.\"\n\nIt seems like the libertarian group are the ones taking the biggest stink with Obama and trying to tie him to the IRS scandal to the point of him actually orchestrating it, and I'm sorry if I don't consider a few seconds of out-of-context-speech definitive evidence of this. I don't even consider it fringe evidence. I consider it grasping at straws. I am not saying you are a libertarian (though you might be, it doesn't really matter), rather that I don't think that it's acceptable to twist this speech into something it wasn't.\n\nThe only way one could assume that this speech was telling people \"do not question big brother, he is here to protect you\" would be if you assume that Obama and his speech writers are so stupid that they would leave a blatant contradiction in a major speech (which I would put large money on not being true), or if you choose to absolutely only see the speech subjectively, from a pre-determined \"I don't like him and secretly want him to be saying this\" standpoint. \n\nThere's just no way to dissect and organize the speech from an intelligent and objective viewpoint and not realize that these parts in question are working in counterpoint, and are not at odds with one another.

I just re-watched the speech, seeing it for the second time, and I cannot find anything which supports your statement unless you pull 45 seconds of the 26 minute speech out of context and ignore what surrounds it.\n\nThe speech actually calls for the literal opposite of what you are saying. He actually specifically is asking people to know who they are voting for, what those people stand for, what they are doing, and if you disagree, say something about it, either in person or with your vote.\n\nThe only part which could POSSIBLY support your point is around the 16 minute mark, when he says that there are people who are extremists and that they should be ignored, and when you watch it in context, especially from the 10 minute mark on you notice that this actually just asking you to listen to informed, educated voices, and make your own opinion, and not to listen to some blogger or news correspondent as if their word is the gospel.\n\nI think that what is happening is people are pulling out 45 seconds of clip that, when out of context, meet their confirmation bias and ignore the other 25 minutes which essentially encourage people to be involved in the political process and help vote out people you think aren't holding up the ideals.\n\nNow, as for the scandals of the Obama administration, a few of them are newsworthy, but most aren't anything new nor exclusive to this administration. You point out Benghazi as if it's the only time in history something like that happened. I believe the statistic is that 12 such scandals happened under the Bush administration, but when one happens under Obama, it's a HUGE deal? It's only a big deal to many when a member of the opposition party happens to be in the executive branch. Perhaps the bigger concern should be that these things happen at all, which is a bipartisan problem, and the entire thesis of Obamas speech was \"class of 2013, help clean politics up so this sort of thing doesn't happen as often.\" Blaming the president as the exclusive cause of such things is childish and shows a lack of understanding of the American system. The president is not a king, and does not have 100% say on how the country runs. The president has become more of a figure head than was initially intended by the framers, thanks largely to Andrew Jackson, but that does not give them the level of power many believe them to have. In fact, I would argue that congress has significantly more power overall, and yet the president frequently gets the blame (just look at the fox news crowd claiming the president can control gas prices, or the liberal bloggers claiming that Bush was the only reason the economy tanked.)\n\nI'm not saying Obama is without fault, nor am I one of his 100% supporters, but at least in the case of this speech, I have a hard time finding anything to support the arguments against it. To me, all this says is that people who haven't heard the whole speech are pulling things out of context to support their cause and their claim themselves informed. The low level of views for the full speech in comparison to the level of news this is generating tells me the amount of informed discussion on this topic is at a minimum.\n\nAlso, I've basically said this many times over already, but considering one of his two thesis points was \"be informed who the man behind the iron curtain is,\" I can't help but laugh at the irony of you using that analogy, since it leads me to believe you haven't actually seen the speech in question, or at the very least, picked a particularly ironic analogy to use as to why this speech is \"bad.\"", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ca0w99c", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1368832313", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_ca0ppmv", "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1431122278, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1368864416, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ca0uch6", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1368826272", "ups": 4, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_ca0i3be", "score": 5, "retrieved_on": 1431124462, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Just out of curiosity, what is it about Obama's commencement speech people are getting up in arms about?

(even though the guys and gals paying their dues would rather be shooting the animals rather than saving them)\n\ni'm not saying they're entirely wrong, and a little look back and we can find a model for how unions can add value to justify their existence.  but that only works if employers see the value in the work the union does.  If a union-sponsored training program open to union members that takes the place of or works in conjunction with, say, the community college system were to come about then i would have to do my best to slander or discredit it in some way.

U could even argue that circumstances out of my control (parents money-making ability, how well they raised me, etc.) determined whether i was prohibited from getting this far.\n\nso perhaps i can see the point you're trying to make, but from my experience i can't see how that's a knock on unions or the Mandatory Union Representation law.

A common complaint of unions is that they just take workers money, work come negotiation time every couple of years, and just hang around with the \"liberals\" and do their bidding for the rest of time. (even though the guys and gals paying their dues would rather be shooting the animals rather than saving them)\n\ni'm not saying they're entirely wrong, and a little look back and we can find a model for how unions can add value to justify their existence.  but that only works if employers see the value in the work the union does.  If a union-sponsored training program open to union members that takes the place of or works in conjunction with, say, the community college system were to come about then i would have to do my best to slander or discredit it in some way.

Yea, that's a win. \n\n&gt;No, actually, he didn't. It's still in the shitter.\n\nThe economy could had been far, far worse, as in great depression levels worse. While there are other factors contributing to the our relatively low unemployment numbers, they are still far better than in the PIGS nations which have 20%+ unemployment numbers. So while yes, the US economy could be better, it could also be worse. Also I would like to remind you that the republicans in Congress have done quite literally everything in their power to thwart the recovery. Believe it our not, when it comes to domestic issues the president can do little without the consent on Congress. \n\n&gt;No, he forced them to buy something that, I, personally cannot afford. What's next, tax people for not owning homes?\n\nIf you cannot afford it then you either get a subsidy, qualify for medicaid, or won't have to pay the penalty. Certainly there are some people out there who may fall into a \"doughnut hole\" in which the ACA ends up costing them more, unfortunately that is going to happen with ever massive legislative effort like the ACA. Even if we accept that the ACA is making your buy insurance you cannot afford, which personally I think is dubious, overall the ACA has/will improve the American health care system. It sure as hell doesn't fix it, but it has improved it for a lot of people. \n\n&gt;Can't speak to that. Unless you're talking about the meddling he did in the car industry, which hasn't exactly worked out as promised (CARS was a flustercluck)\n\nNo... Just no... GM and Chrysler were in bankruptcy and there wasn't enough private capital out there at the time to keep them from shutting down. Had GM and Chrysler truly gone under it could had devastated the American economy as it might had well ruined the entire auto industry, even Ford and the US subsidies of foreign companies, because supply manufactures might well had gone under as well because of loss of business. Sure the Obama administration could had handled it better, but the world doesn't stop when important decisions have to be made. Again like with the economy you must consider the alternative of inaction which *would* had been far worse. \n\n&gt;Thereby interfering in foreign nation's affairs without any authorization, only to let one of our consulates in the country be attacked and our ambassador murdered...? Yeah, that was a real deft move.\n\nThat's just plain silly. The US government along with NATO prevent a humanitarian crisis from occurring by intervening in Libya. Even if we accepted there was a necessary connection between our intervention in Libya and the attack on the US consulate, which I don't accept that there is, I'm sure if asked those four American's killed would be fine trading their lives for the thousands we possibly saved by our intervention. \n\n&gt;But you're right, there are a few things he's done: He renewed the patriot act, authorized indefinite detention of US citizens on US soil, \n\nAll these enjoyed veto proof support in congress. Obama would had obliterated has political capital had he vetoed these bills. \n\n&gt;what else, decided to outright murder people (including US Citizens) \n\nIn time we will perhaps have a better idea of the effects of Obama's foreign policy decisions, particularly when it comes to the issue of using military force against suspected terrorist targets. It is certainly within the realm of possibility that the \"Obama doctrine\" of decisive and often clandestine usage of military force against suspected terrorist targets will come back to haunt us. However there are no \"easy solutions\" when it comes to international terrorism. Cruel calculus is often involved, kill 5 civilians in a strike and maybe you save 10 down the road. Fine you can sit there on your high horse of morality and say \"no more drone strikes ever\" but what happens when terrorist group in the hills of Pakistan, no longer fearing drone strikes, is able to plan and launch an operation to steal a nuclear weapon from a Pakistani military installation? Even if the terrorists never get an opportunity to set off the stolen nuke it will cause an unholy shit storm to occur as damn near every nation in the world will do everything in their power to stop the terrorist from setting off their nuke. And you know what there are going to be a lot of while all this is going on? Civilian deaths. \n\nOf course I'm not saying that this scenario *will* happen or that drone strikes may not very well in the long run might cause this situation to occur, however despite the failures of Obama's foreign policy doctrine in this area, it has thus far seem to be effective in keeping terrorist organizations destabilized. \n\n&gt;rather than capturing them and putting them in Limbo at Gitmo (which he's not done a fucking thing about, by the way).\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1dgtns/obama_guantanamo_is_not_necessary_to_keep_america/c9q9mbv\n\n", "id": "t1_c9qu2n3", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Scaryclouds", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c9qppza", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431352418, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1dhhsl", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9qu2n3", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1367472061", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c9qpfmy", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431354468, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1dhhsl", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9qppza", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1367459031", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c9qjvzt", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431354604, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Really?

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "\nWell, that depends on which theory of economics and recessions you adhere to. (caveat lector: I'm not as versed in the differences in economic schools as I ought be)\n\nKeynesian theory maintains that what causes a recession is an insufficiency of money that is circulating, and that therefore the best thing to do is print more money.  Governments tend to subscribe to this theory because it allows them to convince themselves (and perhaps more importantly, the people) that they're helping by printing more money.\n\nA competing theory is that of [Debt Deflation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_deflation) which holds that the problem is not that of not enough *money* going around so much as not enough *credit.*  Under this theory, money isn't the problem so much as a lack of confidence in credit.  The theory goes that credit is extended and extended and extended, until at some point society starts to realize that their IOUs are being paid off with more IOUs, and we start calling in all of those IOUs, and the economy collapses because we're all busy paying off our stuff from yesterday to buy stuff today or tomorrow.\n\nIn both cases, the problem is that money isn't circulating, but the difference is why.  Keynesian theory is based on the idea that there isn't enough money *to* circulate, and is often associated with the rich taking too much of it.  The Debt Deflation theory, on the other hand, maintains that the problem is not a lack of money, but a lack of faith in money.  This seems to be held by Neoclassical and Austrian economists, and matches with what your father seems to believe.\n\nI, personally, agree.  Greece, Cyprus, Ireland, Iceland, etc, along with both the Great Depression and Great Recession seem to have directly followed (and possibly resulted from) situations where there was rampant spending on credit (deficit/debt spending, or purchases made with personal credit extended with insufficient collateral).  \n\nThe United States is already at debt &amp; deficit spending that caused many Eurozone countries to come under great scrutiny as to whether or not they'd ever be able to pay it back.  The primary reason that the US hasn't fallen victim to this problem yet is that, well, our nation has always been good for it before, and that there is a large amount of international confidence that if we can just get our ducks in a row, we'll go back to being the economic powerhouse we have been for most of the last century.\n\n\n...and that's where the printing of money comes in.  Keynesians believe that printing money will get our ducks in a row, priming the pump, as it were, to get our economy cranking at full speed again. Austrians and Neoclassicists, on the other hand, are terrified that continuing to print more money will result in people realizing that they're not being paid back with money at all, just pieces of paper.  \n\nIf that ever happened, our entire economy would be hosed in a way that has literally never been seen before.  Hosed to a point that the US would almost be forced to go to war on any creditor calling in their debts just to keep itself alive.  Having a fiat currency doesn't *cause* this, but *not* having a fiat currency could *inhibit* it, making it that much harder for the disaster to happen.\n\nHow realistic is it?  I don't know, but I'm not confident enough in Keynesian theory to want to risk it.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "It's good that you caveat your statement with less understanding of Keynesian theory, i'm not too versed in Austrian economics, but I did read a paper on debt deflation; it's good to learn anyway.\n\nKeynesians usually do not advocate printing money to boost demand for goods and services. But rather the vast majority argue that we should borrow the money in the form of bonds and loans. This means we will pay the money back to the lenders, so no wealth is taken out of the economy in the long-term. \n\nThe government then uses this money to employ private businesses or directly hire employees, these people then spend their money and that causes businesses to produce more to compensate for all the new consumers. In good scenarios, this also reduces the deficit of the government, because the gov will be receiving more tax revenue from wealthier and more employed people and the gov will be spending less on the safety net.\n\nI think that a lot of empirical evidence can go both ways, so it's very difficult to take historical precedent, especially the further back we go. The Great Depression case is especially difficult, because that was a culmination of multiple problems in the economy, including a stock market crash, deflation, and a collapse in demand. \n\nI'm not so sure about the causes, but I'm positive about the solutions. FDR's New Deal and the 2009 stimulus saved the economy in both of those instances. [There seems to be consensus (92%) among economists that the 2009 stimulus created jobs](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/the-u-s-economic-policy-debate-is-a-sham.html). The CBO found that the 2009 stimulus raised GDP by about 3.4% and added almost 2.7 million jobs to the economy.\n\n", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Gettin_Slizzard", "id": "t1_c9bgvql", "parent_id": "t1_c9b6pbq", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431622193, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bx68k", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9bgvql", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1365489905", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "PerspicaciousPedant", "id": "t1_c9b6pbq", "parent_id": "t3_1bx68k", "score": 11, "retrieved_on": 1431627059, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bx68k", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9b6pbq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1365460898", "distinguished": null, "ups": 11}

Established under Title 10 and Title 32 of the U.S. Code, state National Guard serves as part of the first-line defense for the United States.[35] The state National Guard is divided up into units stationed in each of the 50 states and U.S. territories and operates under their respective state governor or territorial government.[36] The National Guard may be called up for active duty by the state governors or territorial commanding generals to help respond to domestic emergencies and disasters, such as those caused by hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes.[36]\n\n&gt;The National Guard of the United States is a military reserve force composed of state National Guard members or units under federally recognized active or inactive armed force service for the United States.[37][38] Created by the Militia Act of 1903, the National Guard of the United States is a joint reserve component of the United States Army and the United States Air Force.\n\nSo, \"National Guard\" has more than one meaning. The US NG is part of the us Military (*not* a militia), the State's NG is an *organized militia*.\n\nHowever, as from Heller, neither is the \"unorganized\" or \"citizens\" militia to which the 2A refers, as they were created by federal law and not in existence before the Constitution.\n\nAt the top of that article, the difference is further highlighted:\n\n* The organized militia created by the Militia Act of 1903, which split from the 1792 Uniform Militia forces, and consist of State militia forces, notably the National Guard and the Naval Militia.[2] The National Guard however, is not to be confused with the National Guard of the United States, which is a federally recognized reserve military force, although the two are linked.\n* The reserve militia[3] or unorganized militia, which is presently defined by the Militia Act of 1903 to consist of every able-bodied man of at least 17 and under 45 years of age who is not a member of the National Guard or Naval Militia.(That is, anyone who would be eligible for a draft.) Former members of the armed forces up to age 65 are also considered part of the \"unorganized militia\" per Sec 313 Title 32 of the US Code.[2]\n", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "id": "t1_c972xby", "parent_id": "t1_c96sklq", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431698010, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c972xby", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364925664", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "id": "t1_c96sklq", "parent_id": "t1_c96ptrg", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431702959, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96sklq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364878373", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "id": "t1_c96ptrg", "parent_id": "t1_c96ntbk", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431704254, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96ptrg", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364869412", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "id": "t1_c96ntbk", "parent_id": "t1_c96k4mx", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431705214, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96ntbk", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364863260", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "id": "t1_c96k4mx", "parent_id": "t1_c965kz6", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431706951, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96k4mx", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364853847", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "selftext": "As to straw purchases, I think we need to better define the actual offense.

If there are 100 people who want guns, you need to smuggle 100 guns. Period. If there are 100 people who want heroin, you have to smuggle enough heroin for 100 people, and then do it again when all of the junkies need another hit.\n\n&gt;That's not what I hear.\n\nFeinstein's report? She consistently lies about statistics to push her shitty legislation. Here is her statistic:\n\n&gt;&gt;In a June 9, 2011 response to an inquiry from Senator Feinstein, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) Acting Director Kenneth Melson stated that of the 29,284 firearms recovered in Mexico in 2009 and 2010 and submitted to the ATF National Tracing Center, 20,504 were United States sourced.\n\n[Here's](http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20110209-mexicos-gun-supply-and-90-percent-myth) an article debunking that. Basically, it's selection bias: Mexico only submits the firearms they think the ATF will be able to trace. They do not submit the firearms that came from their own government, were traced to Mexican citizens, or that could not have come from the US.\n\nShe then goes on to quote other Democratic politicans, and advocate her own AWB and Project Gunrunner (which was a miserable failure because of the gross incompetence and negligence of federal officials). \n\n&gt;Yes. It is completely ridiculous to imply that this is a reason not to do anything. Why is less killing not good enough?\n\nYou seem to think that an Assault Weapon Ban would result in less killing. Well, the CDC, DoJ, and National Research Council all found that the 1994 Assault Ban did not measurably decrease the US murder rate. Do you have better evidence than they do?\n\n&gt;\"No matter how effective your umbrella is, you're still gonna get some water on you.

Established under Title 10 and Title 32 of the U.S. Code, state National Guard serves as part of the first-line defense for the United States.[35] The state National Guard is divided up into units stationed in each of the 50 states and U.S. territories and operates under their respective state governor or territorial government.[36] The National Guard may be called up for active duty by the state governors or territorial commanding generals to help respond to domestic emergencies and disasters, such as those caused by hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes.[36]\n\n&gt;The National Guard of the United States is a military reserve force composed of state National Guard members or units under federally recognized active or inactive armed force service for the United States.[37][38] Created by the Militia Act of 1903, the National Guard of the United States is a joint reserve component of the United States Army and the United States Air Force.\n\nSo, \"National Guard\" has more than one meaning. The US NG is part of the us Military (*not* a militia), the State's NG is an *organized militia*.\n\nHowever, as from Heller, neither is the \"unorganized\" or \"citizens\" militia to which the 2A refers, as they were created by federal law and not in existence before the Constitution.\n\nAt the top of that article, the difference is further highlighted:\n\n* The organized militia created by the Militia Act of 1903, which split from the 1792 Uniform Militia forces, and consist of State militia forces, notably the National Guard and the Naval Militia.[2] The National Guard however, is not to be confused with the National Guard of the United States, which is a federally recognized reserve military force, although the two are linked.\n* The reserve militia[3] or unorganized militia, which is presently defined by the Militia Act of 1903 to consist of every able-bodied man of at least 17 and under 45 years of age who is not a member of the National Guard or Naval Militia.(That is, anyone who would be eligible for a draft.) Former members of the armed forces up to age 65 are also considered part of the \"unorganized militia\" per Sec 313 Title 32 of the US Code.[2]\n", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "id": "t1_c972xby", "parent_id": "t1_c96sklq", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431698010, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c972xby", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364925664", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "id": "t1_c96sklq", "parent_id": "t1_c96ptrg", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431702959, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96sklq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364878373", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "id": "t1_c96ptrg", "parent_id": "t1_c96ntbk", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431704254, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96ptrg", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364869412", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "id": "t1_c96ntbk", "parent_id": "t1_c96k4mx", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431705214, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96ntbk", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364863260", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "id": "t1_c96k4mx", "parent_id": "t1_c965kz6", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431706951, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96k4mx", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364853847", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "selftext": "As to straw purchases, I think we need to better define the actual offense.

They do not submit the firearms that came from their own government, were traced to Mexican citizens, or that could not have come from the US.\n\nShe then goes on to quote other Democratic politicans, and advocate her own AWB and Project Gunrunner (which was a miserable failure because of the gross incompetence and negligence of federal officials). \n\n&gt;Yes. It is completely ridiculous to imply that this is a reason not to do anything. Why is less killing not good enough?\n\nYou seem to think that an Assault Weapon Ban would result in less killing. Well, the CDC, DoJ, and National Research Council all found that the 1994 Assault Ban did not measurably decrease the US murder rate. Do you have better evidence than they do?\n\n&gt;\"No matter how effective your umbrella is, you're still gonna get some water on you.

For Congress retains plenary authority to organize the militia, which must include the authority to say who will belong to the organized force.17 That is why the first Militia Act\u2019s requirement that only whites enroll caused States to amend their militia laws to exclude free blacks. See Siegel, The Federal Government\u2019s Power to Enact Color-Conscious Laws, 92 Nw. U. L. Rev. 477, 521\u2013525 (1998). Thus, if petitioners are correct, the Second Amendment protects citizens\u2019 right to use a gun in an organization from which Congress has plenary author\u00adity to exclude them. It guarantees a select militia of the sort the Stuart kings found useful, but not the people\u2019s militia that was the concern of the founding generation.\n\nAnd from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia_%28United_States%29):\n&gt;The National Guard (or National Guard of a State) differs from the National Guard of the United States; however, the two do go hand-in-hand.\n\n&gt;The National Guard is a militia force organized by each of the several states and territories of the United States. Established under Title 10 and Title 32 of the U.S. Code, state National Guard serves as part of the first-line defense for the United States.[35] The state National Guard is divided up into units stationed in each of the 50 states and U.S. territories and operates under their respective state governor or territorial government.[36] The National Guard may be called up for active duty by the state governors or territorial commanding generals to help respond to domestic emergencies and disasters, such as those caused by hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes.[36]\n\n&gt;The National Guard of the United States is a military reserve force composed of state National Guard members or units under federally recognized active or inactive armed force service for the United States.[37][38] Created by the Militia Act of 1903, the National Guard of the United States is a joint reserve component of the United States Army and the United States Air Force.\n\nSo, \"National Guard\" has more than one meaning. The US NG is part of the us Military (*not* a militia), the State's NG is an *organized militia*.\n\nHowever, as from Heller, neither is the \"unorganized\" or \"citizens\" militia to which the 2A refers, as they were created by federal law and not in existence before the Constitution.\n\nAt the top of that article, the difference is further highlighted:\n\n* The organized militia created by the Militia Act of 1903, which split from the 1792 Uniform Militia forces, and consist of State militia forces, notably the National Guard and the Naval Militia.[2] The National Guard however, is not to be confused with the National Guard of the United States, which is a federally recognized reserve military force, although the two are linked.\n* The reserve militia[3] or unorganized militia, which is presently defined by the Militia Act of 1903 to consist of every able-bodied man of at least 17 and under 45 years of age who is not a member of the National Guard or Naval Militia.(That is, anyone who would be eligible for a draft.) Former members of the armed forces up to age 65 are also considered part of the \"unorganized militia\" per Sec 313 Title 32 of the US Code.[2]\n", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "id": "t1_c972xby", "parent_id": "t1_c96sklq", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431698010, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c972xby", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364925664", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "id": "t1_c96sklq", "parent_id": "t1_c96ptrg", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431702959, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96sklq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364878373", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "id": "t1_c96ptrg", "parent_id": "t1_c96ntbk", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431704254, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96ptrg", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364869412", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "id": "t1_c96ntbk", "parent_id": "t1_c96k4mx", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431705214, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96ntbk", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364863260", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "id": "t1_c96k4mx", "parent_id": "t1_c965kz6", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431706951, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96k4mx", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364853847", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "selftext": "As to straw purchases, I think we need to better define the actual offense.

Even stridently liberal judges often seek to give narrow rulings, order retrials, or dismiss cases based on standing.  The court is much more comfortable ruling on the specific limits of existing law, bringing clarity to the grey areas between law and practice.  In that sense, it's less about how persuasive the oral arguments are, and more about whether the petitioning parties are persuasive enough to compel the court to act in a grand, sweeping manor which is out of their character.  Further, a great deal of the argument is contained in the amicus briefs, editorials and supporting arguments submitted by a number of other expert parties.  This is why you see editorial articles in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal from all the interested parties.  The Judges read these and include them in their deliberations.  If a judge doesn't want to make new law, if they would rather return the issue to the state or federal government, they will entertain arguments that let them off the hook or at least rule as narrowly as possible.  Brown v. Board of Education and Roe v. Wade were landmark decisions because the Supreme Court took a strong hand in a very complex and controversial subject.\n\nAll that to say, don't get too swept up in the oral arguments.

Issuing offices are usually only open during normal business hours, so what do you do if you have to work during that time? Lines at those places can be obnoxiously long too. So even if you manage to get off work and get to one before it closes, will you have time to stand around in line for hours when you probably have kids to take care of, errands to run, or other tasks that matter much more to your day to day life than casting a ballot that is unlikely to actually matter anyway? \n\nIt's easy to call someone lazy when your experience is limited to driving to the DMV, standing in line for 10 minutes and going on your merry way. It is much, much harder for some people. Their shitty circumstances do not mean that their opinion matters less than yours, and they for damn sure should not be barred from their constitutional right to participate in our democracy just so you can prevent a statistically insignificant number of assholes from committing a victimless, non-violent crime. \n\nVoter ID is a solution in search of a problem. The fact is that voter fraud is a non-issue. The system works as is, so why should we impose another barrier on citizen's ability to vote? It is difficult enough as is for some people to get registered and make it to a polling place on election day.

That is a [bad assumption.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo)\n\n\n\n&gt; The Republic is not in any danger from National Popular Vote\n\nI would argue that it *would* be, because all of the shit that happened with recounts, lawsuits, etc, in FL2000, WA2004, MN2008, and was just *waiting* to happen in every swing state this past presidential election, would be likely to happen in *every* state in *every* election, because a few hundred/thousand votes here and there could change the entire national results, even if those votes were in solidly blue or red states.\n\nWhat's worse, it would *significantly* make things harder on any sort of upstart candidate/party.  Let's say that one or the other major political party pulled shenanigans (like they did on different topics this past election) and the candidate who was *the* most preferred candidate is set aside by the political party in favor of the \"designated winner\" (that Mr Romney so obviously was this year), and decides to run anyway.  Or let's say we have another Ross Perot.   If every vote counted directly to who won the presidency, then *no one* would truly be free to vote their conscience *ever again.*  Oh, sure, *occasionally* you *might* have someone whose conscience aligned with one or the other major party candidate, but the fact is that anyone and everyone who voted for someone else because they honestly believed that they would be a better president would be *directly blamed* for the 2nd place candidate losing.  \n\nYou want to talk about entitlements?  This is the biggest entitlement out there: the fact that the Republican and Democratic parties believe, have absolute faith that your votes *belong to them.*  A national popular election would make this even more true (in practice) than it already is, which is an affront to everything that makes democracy a good idea.\n\nAnd you're also directly ignoring the fact that \n\n&gt; The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government[.]\n\nIt could be argued that by going to a National Popular Vote without a constitutional amendment would deny many of those states a truly republican government.  For example, look at UT, WY, and ID,  which voted for Romney at 72.8%, 68.6%, and  64.5%, respectively.  If they were members of the NPVIC, their government would *not* be representing their will in any meaningful way.\n\nLikewise, look at the 2004 results for DC (89.2%), MA (61.9%), and VT (58.9%), all three of which are members of the NPVIC.  Their clear preference for Mr Kerry would not be reflected in their elector votes, and thus it would not be a (state level) republican government.\n\nA better compromise would be a Proportional Allocation of Electors, under that, it would *only* take their own state into account, but would still make the will of the people more direct.  For example, in 2012 FL was 50.01%D/49.13%R/0.86%O and North Carolina was 48.35%D/50.39%R/1.26O.  Instead of having an elector split of 29/0/0 and 0/15/0, you would have something more like 15/14/0 and 7/8/0, respectively.  In general this would not change the outcomes of elections, but it *would* likely result in them much more closely matching the popular vote, without there even being a *question* as to whether or not it undermines a \"Republican Form of Government.\"", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; The proportional method also could result in third party candidates winning electoral votes that would deny either major party candidate the necessary majority vote of electors and throw the process into Congress to decide.\n\n\nYes and no.

The closest electoral-vote election in American history (in 2000) was determined by 537 votes, all in one state, when there was a lead of 537,179 (1,000 times more) popular votes nationwide.\n\t\t\nFor a national popular vote election to be as easy to switch as 2000, it would have to be two hundred times closer than the 1960 election--and, in popular-vote terms, forty times closer than 2000 itself. \n\t\nWhich system offers vote suppressors or fraudulent voters a better shot at success for a smaller effort?\n\nThe current presidential election system makes a repeat of 2000 more likely, not less likely. All you need is a thin and contested margin in a single state with enough electoral votes to make a difference. It's much less likely that the national vote will be close enough that voting irregularities in a single area will swing enough net votes to make a difference. If we'd had National Popular Vote in 2000, a recount in Florida would not have been an issue.\n\nThe idea that recounts will be likely and messy with National Popular Vote is distracting. \n\nThe 2000 presidential election was an artificial crisis created because of Bush's lead of 537 popular votes in Florida. Gore's nationwide lead was 537,179 popular votes (1,000 times larger). Given the miniscule number of votes that are changed by a typical statewide recount (averaging only 274 votes); no one would have requested a recount or disputed the results in 2000 if the national popular vote had controlled the outcome. Indeed, no one (except perhaps almanac writers and trivia buffs) would have cared that one of the candidates happened to have a 537-vote margin in Florida. \n\nRecounts are far more likely in the current system of state-by-state winner-take-all methods.\n\t\nThe possibility of recounts should not even be a consideration in debating the merits of a national popular vote. No one has ever suggested that the possibility of a recount constitutes a valid reason why state governors or U.S. Senators, for example, should not be elected by a popular vote. \n\t\nThe question of recounts comes to mind in connection with presidential elections only because the current system so frequently creates artificial crises and unnecessary disputes. \n\t\nWe do and would vote state by state. Each state manages its own election and is prepared to conduct a recount. \n\nThe state-by-state winner-take-all system is not a firewall, but instead causes unnecessary fires.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an arsonist itching to burn down the whole neighborhood by torching a single house.\u201d Hertzberg\n\t\nGiven that there is a recount only once in about 160 statewide elections, and given there is a presidential election once every four years, one would expect a recount about once in 640 years with the National Popular Vote. The actual probability of a close national election would be even less than that because recounts are less likely with larger pools of votes. \n\nThe average change in the margin of victory as a result of a statewide recount was a mere 296 votes in a 10-year study of 2,884 elections. \n\nNo recount would have been warranted in any of the nation\u2019s 57 previous presidential elections if the outcome had been based on the nationwide count. \n\t\t\nThe common nationwide date for meeting of the Electoral College has been set by federal law as the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December.  With both the current system and the National Popular Vote, all counting, recounting, and judicial proceedings must be conducted so as to reach a \"final determination\" prior to the meeting of the Electoral College.  In particular, the U.S. Supreme Court has made it clear that the states are expected to make their \"final determination\" six days before the Electoral College meets.\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8uhu1c", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1363128575", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1a3ehf", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1a3ehf", "selftext": "Please point out to me exactly where I endorsed the current set up?

Let's say that one or the other major political party pulled shenanigans (like they did on different topics this past election) and the candidate who was *the* most preferred candidate is set aside by the political party in favor of the \"designated winner\" (that Mr Romney so obviously was this year), and decides to run anyway.  Or let's say we have another Ross Perot.   If every vote counted directly to who won the presidency, then *no one* would truly be free to vote their conscience *ever again.*  Oh, sure, *occasionally* you *might* have someone whose conscience aligned with one or the other major party candidate, but the fact is that anyone and everyone who voted for someone else because they honestly believed that they would be a better president would be *directly blamed* for the 2nd place candidate losing.  \n\nYou want to talk about entitlements?  This is the biggest entitlement out there: the fact that the Republican and Democratic parties believe, have absolute faith that your votes *belong to them.*  A national popular election would make this even more true (in practice) than it already is, which is an affront to everything that makes democracy a good idea.\n\nAnd you're also directly ignoring the fact that \n\n&gt; The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government[.]\n\nIt could be argued that by going to a National Popular Vote without a constitutional amendment would deny many of those states a truly republican government.  For example, look at UT, WY, and ID,  which voted for Romney at 72.8%, 68.6%, and  64.5%, respectively.  If they were members of the NPVIC, their government would *not* be representing their will in any meaningful way.\n\nLikewise, look at the 2004 results for DC (89.2%), MA (61.9%), and VT (58.9%), all three of which are members of the NPVIC.  Their clear preference for Mr Kerry would not be reflected in their elector votes, and thus it would not be a (state level) republican government.\n\nA better compromise would be a Proportional Allocation of Electors, under that, it would *only* take their own state into account, but would still make the will of the people more direct.  For example, in 2012 FL was 50.01%D/49.13%R/0.86%O and North Carolina was 48.35%D/50.39%R/1.26O.  Instead of having an elector split of 29/0/0 and 0/15/0, you would have something more like 15/14/0 and 7/8/0, respectively.  In general this would not change the outcomes of elections, but it *would* likely result in them much more closely matching the popular vote, without there even being a *question* as to whether or not it undermines a \"Republican Form of Government.\"", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; The proportional method also could result in third party candidates winning electoral votes that would deny either major party candidate the necessary majority vote of electors and throw the process into Congress to decide.\n\n\nYes and no.

All you need is a thin and contested margin in a single state with enough electoral votes to make a difference. It's much less likely that the national vote will be close enough that voting irregularities in a single area will swing enough net votes to make a difference. If we'd had National Popular Vote in 2000, a recount in Florida would not have been an issue.\n\nThe idea that recounts will be likely and messy with National Popular Vote is distracting. \n\nThe 2000 presidential election was an artificial crisis created because of Bush's lead of 537 popular votes in Florida. Gore's nationwide lead was 537,179 popular votes (1,000 times larger). Given the miniscule number of votes that are changed by a typical statewide recount (averaging only 274 votes); no one would have requested a recount or disputed the results in 2000 if the national popular vote had controlled the outcome. Indeed, no one (except perhaps almanac writers and trivia buffs) would have cared that one of the candidates happened to have a 537-vote margin in Florida. \n\nRecounts are far more likely in the current system of state-by-state winner-take-all methods.\n\t\nThe possibility of recounts should not even be a consideration in debating the merits of a national popular vote. No one has ever suggested that the possibility of a recount constitutes a valid reason why state governors or U.S. Senators, for example, should not be elected by a popular vote. \n\t\nThe question of recounts comes to mind in connection with presidential elections only because the current system so frequently creates artificial crises and unnecessary disputes. \n\t\nWe do and would vote state by state. Each state manages its own election and is prepared to conduct a recount. \n\nThe state-by-state winner-take-all system is not a firewall, but instead causes unnecessary fires.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an arsonist itching to burn down the whole neighborhood by torching a single house.\u201d Hertzberg\n\t\nGiven that there is a recount only once in about 160 statewide elections, and given there is a presidential election once every four years, one would expect a recount about once in 640 years with the National Popular Vote. The actual probability of a close national election would be even less than that because recounts are less likely with larger pools of votes. \n\nThe average change in the margin of victory as a result of a statewide recount was a mere 296 votes in a 10-year study of 2,884 elections. \n\nNo recount would have been warranted in any of the nation\u2019s 57 previous presidential elections if the outcome had been based on the nationwide count. \n\t\t\nThe common nationwide date for meeting of the Electoral College has been set by federal law as the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December.  With both the current system and the National Popular Vote, all counting, recounting, and judicial proceedings must be conducted so as to reach a \"final determination\" prior to the meeting of the Electoral College.  In particular, the U.S. Supreme Court has made it clear that the states are expected to make their \"final determination\" six days before the Electoral College meets.\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8uhu1c", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1363128575", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1a3ehf", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1a3ehf", "selftext": "Please point out to me exactly where I endorsed the current set up?

In the current presidential election system, 48 states award all of their electors to the winners of their state. This is not what the Founding Fathers intended.\n\t\nThe Founding Fathers in the Constitution did not require states to allow their citizens to vote for president, much less award all their electoral votes based upon the vote of their citizens. \n\nThe presidential election system we have today is not in the Constitution, and enacting National Popular Vote would not need an amendment. State-by-state winner-take-all laws to award Electoral College votes, were eventually enacted by states, using their exclusive power to do so, AFTER the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution. Now our current system can be changed by state laws again.\n\nUnable to agree on any particular method, the Founding Fathers left the choice of method for selecting presidential electors exclusively to the states by adopting the language contained in section 1 of Article II of the U.S. Constitution-- \"Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors . . .\"   The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly characterized the authority of the state legislatures over the manner of awarding their electoral votes as \"plenary\" and \"exclusive.\"\n\nThe National Popular Vote bill preserves the Electoral College and state control of elections.  It changes the way electoral votes are awarded in the Electoral College.  The candidate with the most votes would win, as in virtually every other election in the country.\n\nUnder National Popular Vote, every vote, everywhere, would be politically relevant and equal in every presidential election. Every vote would be included in the state counts and national count. The candidate with the most popular votes in all 50 states and DC would get the 270+ electoral votes from the enacting states. That majority of electoral votes guarantees the candidate with the most popular votes in all 50 states and DC wins the presidency.\n\nThe Republic is not in any danger from National Popular Vote. \nWith National Popular Vote, the United States would still be a republic, in which citizens continue to elect the President by a majority of Electoral College votes by states, to represent us and conduct the business of government in the periods between elections.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8uawmr", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1363109599", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "PerspicaciousPedant", "id": "t1_c8u4fp8", "parent_id": "t1_c8twkl5", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431559116, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1a3ehf", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8u4fp8", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1363075200", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_19cye4", "selftext": "If it were up to me, I'd probably go with somewhere in excess of 1000 (though I'd ideally like to triple or quadruple it).  One suggestion I've heard is something called the \"Wyoming Rule,\" where the proportion of legislators to constituents is never to be greater than the population of the smallest state.  As such, Wyoming, with only ~575K people would have one representative, and every other state would get roughly one per ~575K +/-, for roughly 544 representatives.  I'd personally prefer a variant where Wyoming gets 2  (1089 reps, ~290k constituents per rep) or 3 (1633, ~190k per).  The latter two options would put us somewhere in the [middle of the pack](http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/04/representatives_parliament) for representativeness of our national legislature.\n\nThe advantages as I see them:\n\n* Cutting the ratio of representatives means that you would have much more accurate representation of the populace, so that not only would you not get a party that 63% of the population feels is out of touch controlling 57% of the house, you'd have a decent chance at having at least a few representatives of smaller parties\n  * This would have the effect of slowing down most legislation.  Yes, that's a good thing, because huge, overreaching bills currently get rammed through without much discussion at all.  Whether you like or dislike the Patriot Act or PPACA, the fact that nobody read the full thing before voting on it should revolt you.\n* By cutting roughly 20% (or 60%-73%, respectively) off the size of the constituency, you would significantly cut down on how much money was required to run for office.  Instead of having to get your name and message out to half a million people, spending a fair bit on advertising, you could actually gain significant traction simply by getting a group of friends and going door to door in your district.  Heck, you may know most of them anyway.\n  * Additionally, as one of about 200k people your voice would be four times louder in the ear of your representative.  Between that, and the lower cost of campaigning, lobbyists would have a lot harder time offering your representative money to ignore the concerns you voice.\n* With smaller constituencies, you'd have smaller districts, too.  This would make Gerrymandering that much more obvious.  Either obviously gerrymandered, or obviously *not* gerrymandered.\n* With the increased size of the house (and I'd also like to add a third senator per state), the electoral college would *much* more closely match the popular vote.\n* Lobbying would become a lot harder.  In order to achieve the same goal (say, buying off half of congress), they'll have to spend significantly more money.  \n\nCons: \n\n* We would need a significantly larger chamber. (Costing money)\n* This would significantly increase the size of the money set aside for congresscritters.  Currently, we spend about $900M every year on congress critters (535 @ $1.5M budget + 175k salary), and my proposal would increase that to about $3B.  On one hand, that's $2B more than currently.  On the other hand, that is less than 0.08% of the federal expenditures for 2012.\n* It would be a lot harder for industries to meet with representatives.  Yes, that's a bad thing.  If we end up with true citizen-statesmen, as is my goal, they will be that much less likely to know about the effects of the proposed regulations on the Lefthanded Widget industry, and will need to be able to discuss things with Industry Representatives so that they can cast an Informed vote (this, incidentally, is why Lobbying isn't, can't be, and shouldn't be banned)", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_19cye4", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_19cye4", "selftext": "Look, buddy, if I wanted my post to have a TL;DR...\n\n...I probably couldn't have done a better job than you did.

In a job market where there are more jobs than workers this would never happened, when jobs are the commodity this is guaranteed to happen. If the work they were doing was worth less than what they are paying then the job couldn't exist. These jobs do exist and these companies make huge profits therefore the worker should definitely not be paid any less and in almost all cases deserves to be paid more. Even though the work is menial it is still crucial and everyone's time and effort is worth something so long as they can produce the desired result.\n\nIf it wasn't the case that worker wages would be driven down to next to nothing given the opportunity then there wouldn't be outsourced slave-labor all over the world. That, sir, is demonstrable. We have seen what a market heavy with available labor and lacking in jobs creates and it is sweatshops and children dying at sewing machines from exhaustion. How are they to bargain for their worth? How are they to better themselves.\n\nYou call these people worthless and that is a tragedy. Opportunity comes in many forms, geographic location, race, gender, family, country. Please do not try and tell me that any of these workers are 'worthless' that is the value that your kind of mentality forces onto them. You manifest the worthless human by denying them the ability to seek their worth. I will grant you that there are some real scumbags working at McDonalds that probably don't deserve even that opportunity but I would wager a great deal that if you were to examine their personal histories you would find very few of them that actually squandered any opportunity but would rather find harsher realities than you have lived through and would be impressed that they are even a functioning person. \n\nThere are exceptions, there are exceptional people who claw their way out of these lives and I applaud, envy, and admire them but they are very rare and quite unique.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_17rmvq", "selftext": "Let me try to put it simply (I know, I spend too much time in ELI5).\n\nImagine you're a manufacturer of Widgets.  You make ~100 widgets/a month.  Now, you've been selling widgets for $20 each for years.  Your customers include Banks, Stores, and average citizens.  When the government prints  more money and gives it to banks, banks have more money to buy widgets than they used to.  As such, instead of their normal 30 widgets a month, they buy 40 widgets per month.  Now, all of a sudden when you're down to your last 20 widgets for January, you know that you still have customers who, between them, order 30 widgets.\n\nSo what do you do? Do you just sell the 20 remaining widgets, and apologize to the remaining customers?  That's not very nice to the people who have been placing a regular order with you for years, but do so in the 4th week of them month, rather than the first.\n\nDo you place them on back order?   That's not going to work, either, because with the bank buying more than their normal amount, that means you'll be 20 short next month.\n\nDo you try to make more?  Possibly, but that's going to mean hiring more peopl or buying more widget-making machines, which is going to cost more money than you normally bring in, so you're going to have to increase the cost of the widgets.  That will make you more money in the long term, but it means you don't have as much money now.\n\nThe other option is that you keep making the same number of widgets, and sell them for more money.   This will make everybody buy fewer widgets, a number you can supply regularly, but you'll get more money for each one, and you'll be able to buy more widget-makers.\n\n\n....except it doesn't quite work that way.  Because now that the Banks and Stores and People have to pay more for their widgets, they need to bring in more money just to break even. So they start charging more for  food or rent, they ask for raises, and eventually the widget making materials cost more money.  Meaning before long, you can't *afford* to sell widgets at $20 each anymore, and have to sell them at $22 each.  And that is inflation: when the same things that cost a certain amount at one point in time cost more at a later point in time.\n\n**TL;DR:** because in order to meet demand, people will increase their prices, requiring others to increase *their* prices, and the prices will stay that high because everybody has to spend that much to ensure that they can afford to buy what they need to supply what other people need.\n\n**Still TL;DR:** [Watch this Duck Tales clip (4:27)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_LWQQrpSc4)", "id": "t1_c88fljs", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "PerspicaciousPedant", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c88j08p", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "FA_politics", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c88fljs", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431168663, "controversiality": 0, "body": "This helps.

Even if you go with vouchers, there will always be students that private schools won't accept. Maybe they violate school rules too often, maybe they're not bright enough, or maybe the school only has desks for the 500 who do the best on their application tests.  Whatever the reason, there will always be students that will not be able to find a place in schools that can refuse enrollment. \n\nThe problem with that is that the publc schools, who have to accept the dim and delinquent, become places that no one would ever want to work.  That's where my favorite politician's Voucher system comes in.  2/3 of the money allocated by the state for each student would be associated with the student, as a voucher, and the other 1/3 would be associated with the district.  Meaning that if a school has 65% of their students leave for some private school or another, the remaining 35% of the students will effectively get twice the funding from the state.\n\n\n---\nBut really, that's not the problem.  The real problems I see are, as doctorquien mentioned, a lack of parental involvement (most often due to the need to spend so much time working just to make ends meet), and an overly restrictive environment.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_17d5ut", "selftext": "That statement seems to assume that the 2nd amendment allows for the right of the Military to bear arms, rather than the people's, which is *completely* false.  Would you like me to go through the trouble of explaining precisely why that *cannot* be a correct interpretation of the 2nd amendment, or would you like to simply trust that I, as a linguist, probably know what I'm talking about?\n\n---\nEDIT: Since I have had ~~an asshole demand~~ someone request the explanation I offered, here it is:\n\nFirst, the [syntax tree of the text of the 2nd Amendment.](http://i.imgur.com/1tcfRAth.png)\n\nYou'll notice that the reference to the militia is way the heck off on the left, in S2, far removed from the \"right,\" NP5 in S3, yet that right is directly modified by the phrase \"of the people\" to form NP8.  This is the exact same construction as \"my error\" or \"your response,\" which clearly shows that the right belongs to the people.  This is support for the individual right interpretation, unless you mean to contend that throughout the bill of rights \"the people\" has a collectivist meaning.  Before you make that assertion, however, let's look at the effects of that:  \n\n(2) The right to bear arms would not be held by the individual, but by the National Guard, etc.   But...   \n(1) The right to petition for redress of grievances against the government could likewise be limited to some, government organized group  \n(4) The 4th could be cited to protect government Classified information but not your private information.  \n(9) The government would be able to define the groups that had additional rights  \n(10) Any power not already allocated would be... allocated at the whim of the government?\n\nIs that really a sensible set of interpretations? In as much as I believe not, in as much as the courts have consistently ruled that \"the people\" refers to the individual, that means that the right is an individual's, not a group's.  What's more, I cannot find any valid structure that links \"right\" to \"militia\" without first being linked to \"the people\"\n\n---\nNext, we will look at the relation between the Militia clause and the Operative clause.\n\nClearly, the militia clause is an explanatory statement, giving the reasons as to why the right is protected.  The question, however, is whether the right, as protected by the 2nd Amendment, is contingent on that reasoning.  One test to determine the relation between two sentences is the Negation Test, wherein you negate each of the sentences in turn.  If there is a contradiction, then the sentences are inextricably linked. Let's try that.\n\n1. [A well regulated militia not being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.](http://i.imgur.com/aK3euBoh.png) \n2. [A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms may be infringed.](http://i.imgur.com/SoxAuWxh.png)\n3. [A well regulated militia not being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms may be infringed.](http://i.imgur.com/JJfLGb5h.png)\n\nNow, the question is what is the meaning of these different phrasings.  In each of them, the right is that of the individual, but the reasoning changes.  In (1), we've negated the necessity of the well regulated militia.  My reading of this is that because a militia is not necessary, or does not need to be well regulated, individuals are allowed to keep and bear arms.  It's odd, but not contradictory.\n\nIn version (2), we have the sentence that the collectivists want to believe the 2nd amendment actually reads. In it, you have a necessary militia, and as a result of that, the state can infringe on the rights of the people.  This, to my mind, proves that that interpretation is the *exact opposite* of the terms dictated by the operative clause.  I even see its appeal, but that doesn't change the fact that that is in direct conflict with what the amendment says.\n\nIn version (3), we find the same sort of link as was asserted by [George Mason](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mason), that the militia is, by definition, the people, and since they are not necessary aspect of the state, the right to arms may be limited.  Again, this is the exact opposite of the mandate of the amendment.\n\nSo, we have (2) and (3) reversing the mandate, and (1) maintaining it in the same form as the actual amendment.  Because the meaning of the versions which negated the Militia clause match the non-negated version ([2,3] vs [O,1]), rather than matching each other ([1,3] vs [O,2]), it is clear that the militia clause can be severed from the *effect* of the law.\n\n---\nFinally, let's look at the concept of severability.\n\nIs there a difference in the rammifications of the following statements, with respect to the right asserted:\n\n\n* A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\n* The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\n\nI assert, based on the above work, and my native speaker intuition, that there is not a difference.  Additional evidence for this is in the interpretation of another document written about a decade and a half earlier, drafted by many of the same people: [The Declaration of Independence.](http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html) \n\nIn that document, you have 4 paragraphs and 27 listed grievances giving the reasoning for the actual declaration of independence in the final paragraph, with the preceding text being explicitly acknowledged as the reasoning for the declaration.  If the effect of the second clause of the 2nd Amendment can be nullified by a change in circumstances underlying the reasoning, could not the Crown legally reassert dominion over its former colonies now that many of the grievances no longer hold?  After all, it's been something like 200 years since troops have been quartered in the US, and the Queen does not behave in any way like a Tyrant; the vast majority of the reasoning, a large number of the grievances, are no longer valid.\n\nSo it brings the question, is a spech act, be it a declaration, or an enactment of law, valid beyond the reasoning behind it?  Is it severable from the rest of the passage? I maintain that it is.", "id": "t1_c84jyr7", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "PerspicaciousPedant", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; would you like to simply trust that I, as a linguist, probably know what I'm talking about?\n\nBecause a linguist knows better about constitutional law and politics than a political scientist?

Would you like me to go through the trouble of explaining precisely why that *cannot* be a correct interpretation of the 2nd amendment, or would you like to simply trust that I, as a linguist, probably know what I'm talking about?\n\n---\nEDIT: Since I have had ~~an asshole demand~~ someone request the explanation I offered, here it is:\n\nFirst, the [syntax tree of the text of the 2nd Amendment.](http://i.imgur.com/1tcfRAth.png)\n\nYou'll notice that the reference to the militia is way the heck off on the left, in S2, far removed from the \"right,\" NP5 in S3, yet that right is directly modified by the phrase \"of the people\" to form NP8.  This is the exact same construction as \"my error\" or \"your response,\" which clearly shows that the right belongs to the people.  This is support for the individual right interpretation, unless you mean to contend that throughout the bill of rights \"the people\" has a collectivist meaning.  Before you make that assertion, however, let's look at the effects of that:  \n\n(2) The right to bear arms would not be held by the individual, but by the National Guard, etc.   But...   \n(1) The right to petition for redress of grievances against the government could likewise be limited to some, government organized group  \n(4) The 4th could be cited to protect government Classified information but not your private information.  \n(9) The government would be able to define the groups that had additional rights  \n(10) Any power not already allocated would be... allocated at the whim of the government?\n\nIs that really a sensible set of interpretations? In as much as I believe not, in as much as the courts have consistently ruled that \"the people\" refers to the individual, that means that the right is an individual's, not a group's.  What's more, I cannot find any valid structure that links \"right\" to \"militia\" without first being linked to \"the people\"\n\n---\nNext, we will look at the relation between the Militia clause and the Operative clause.\n\nClearly, the militia clause is an explanatory statement, giving the reasons as to why the right is protected.  The question, however, is whether the right, as protected by the 2nd Amendment, is contingent on that reasoning.  One test to determine the relation between two sentences is the Negation Test, wherein you negate each of the sentences in turn.  If there is a contradiction, then the sentences are inextricably linked. Let's try that.\n\n1. [A well regulated militia not being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.](http://i.imgur.com/aK3euBoh.png) \n2. [A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms may be infringed.](http://i.imgur.com/SoxAuWxh.png)\n3. [A well regulated militia not being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms may be infringed.](http://i.imgur.com/JJfLGb5h.png)\n\nNow, the question is what is the meaning of these different phrasings.  In each of them, the right is that of the individual, but the reasoning changes.  In (1), we've negated the necessity of the well regulated militia.  My reading of this is that because a militia is not necessary, or does not need to be well regulated, individuals are allowed to keep and bear arms.  It's odd, but not contradictory.\n\nIn version (2), we have the sentence that the collectivists want to believe the 2nd amendment actually reads. In it, you have a necessary militia, and as a result of that, the state can infringe on the rights of the people.  This, to my mind, proves that that interpretation is the *exact opposite* of the terms dictated by the operative clause.  I even see its appeal, but that doesn't change the fact that that is in direct conflict with what the amendment says.\n\nIn version (3), we find the same sort of link as was asserted by [George Mason](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mason), that the militia is, by definition, the people, and since they are not necessary aspect of the state, the right to arms may be limited.  Again, this is the exact opposite of the mandate of the amendment.\n\nSo, we have (2) and (3) reversing the mandate, and (1) maintaining it in the same form as the actual amendment.  Because the meaning of the versions which negated the Militia clause match the non-negated version ([2,3] vs [O,1]), rather than matching each other ([1,3] vs [O,2]), it is clear that the militia clause can be severed from the *effect* of the law.\n\n---\nFinally, let's look at the concept of severability.\n\nIs there a difference in the rammifications of the following statements, with respect to the right asserted:\n\n\n* A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\n* The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\n\nI assert, based on the above work, and my native speaker intuition, that there is not a difference.  Additional evidence for this is in the interpretation of another document written about a decade and a half earlier, drafted by many of the same people: [The Declaration of Independence.](http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html) \n\nIn that document, you have 4 paragraphs and 27 listed grievances giving the reasoning for the actual declaration of independence in the final paragraph, with the preceding text being explicitly acknowledged as the reasoning for the declaration.  If the effect of the second clause of the 2nd Amendment can be nullified by a change in circumstances underlying the reasoning, could not the Crown legally reassert dominion over its former colonies now that many of the grievances no longer hold?  After all, it's been something like 200 years since troops have been quartered in the US, and the Queen does not behave in any way like a Tyrant; the vast majority of the reasoning, a large number of the grievances, are no longer valid.\n\nSo it brings the question, is a spech act, be it a declaration, or an enactment of law, valid beyond the reasoning behind it?  Is it severable from the rest of the passage? I maintain that it is.", "id": "t1_c84jyr7", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "PerspicaciousPedant", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; would you like to simply trust that I, as a linguist, probably know what I'm talking about?\n\nBecause a linguist knows better about constitutional law and politics than a political scientist?

In F', it is clearly an attempt to *prevent* rational discussion. In F'' and F''', it's more of a non-sequitur, as F'' asserts that it doesn't mess anything up, an F''' does the same, though slightly weaker, both versions way making the associated rule seem arbitrary.  \n\nYou ask whether I would feel my duty to act on the Mod Mandate, but that isn't the relevant question.  The parallel question is whether there are cases in which the right to keep and bear arms *should* be infringed.  That, however, is not a question of constitutionality, but a question as to whether or not the constitution should be amended. \n\nThe relevant question, the question that parallels constitutionality, is whether the duty exists, whether an Admin could revoke Mod privileges based on someone failing to follow the mandate.  \n\n---\nBut here's where things get really fun: actually negating the militia clause.\n\n* [G] A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\n* [G'] A well regulated militia not being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\n\nIn G, the reading that is so often proposed by proponents of the collectivist reading is that the people are part of the militia, and therefore, as part of the militia, it is their right (I disagree with that reading, but that's the point in contention here).  In G', however, the reading is quite clearly that the people are separate from the militia (which is either unnecessary, or does not need to be orderly, disciplined, or whatever), and therefore it is their right we are talking about.  That said, in both cases, the right is secured to *the people,* either in the understanding that they *are* the well regulated militia, or in the understanding that they are separate from it.\n\nWhat's more, the collectivist position is better supported by the following, a negation of the performative clause:\n\n* [G''] A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, it is not the case that the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\n\n*That* is the version that would allow for arms to be banned or restricted from the people, because it is the militia, as distinct from the people, who will keep them in their armories, and bear them when called upon.  And, according to my native speaker intuition, that version is *very* different from [G], the version of the 2nd amendment which was ratified and authenticated.\n\nFor the record, the Collectivist reading is *half* right, in that the right to arms is secured to the people as part of the militia, but it ignores one major fact: in the words of George Mason (the man who penned the Virginia Declaration of Rights, on which the 2nd Amendment was based), \"[...] what is the militia? It is the whole people, except for a few public officials.\"\n\nSummary\n---\nI think I have proven that the explanatory clause has no impact *at all* on the mandate.  None of the (well formed) versions of the 2nd Amendment have at all changed the meaning of the actual performative.  \n\n* The \"hereby\" test changed nothing when added to the Right Clause, \nbut *did* change the meaning when added to the Militia Clause, proving that the Militia clause is not part of the performative.\n* I believe I thoroughly disproved that there is any appositive construction in the 2nd amendment.\n* The negation test seems to prove that the only possible negation that creates a reading that would allow for the banning of arms as some mean to do is a negation of the clause that we have proven to be the performative one.\n\n---\n\nNPI's\n---\nI *do* in fact have positive anymore.

I wouldn't call it well formed, but I'm not certain I'd call it ill-formed, either.

The parallel question is whether there are cases in which the right to keep and bear arms *should* be infringed.  That, however, is not a question of constitutionality, but a question as to whether or not the constitution should be amended. \n\nThe relevant question, the question that parallels constitutionality, is whether the duty exists, whether an Admin could revoke Mod privileges based on someone failing to follow the mandate.  \n\n---\nBut here's where things get really fun: actually negating the militia clause.\n\n* [G] A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\n* [G'] A well regulated militia not being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\n\nIn G, the reading that is so often proposed by proponents of the collectivist reading is that the people are part of the militia, and therefore, as part of the militia, it is their right (I disagree with that reading, but that's the point in contention here).  In G', however, the reading is quite clearly that the people are separate from the militia (which is either unnecessary, or does not need to be orderly, disciplined, or whatever), and therefore it is their right we are talking about.  That said, in both cases, the right is secured to *the people,* either in the understanding that they *are* the well regulated militia, or in the understanding that they are separate from it.\n\nWhat's more, the collectivist position is better supported by the following, a negation of the performative clause:\n\n* [G''] A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, it is not the case that the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\n\n*That* is the version that would allow for arms to be banned or restricted from the people, because it is the militia, as distinct from the people, who will keep them in their armories, and bear them when called upon.  And, according to my native speaker intuition, that version is *very* different from [G], the version of the 2nd amendment which was ratified and authenticated.\n\nFor the record, the Collectivist reading is *half* right, in that the right to arms is secured to the people as part of the militia, but it ignores one major fact: in the words of George Mason (the man who penned the Virginia Declaration of Rights, on which the 2nd Amendment was based), \"[...] what is the militia? It is the whole people, except for a few public officials.\"\n\nSummary\n---\nI think I have proven that the explanatory clause has no impact *at all* on the mandate.  None of the (well formed) versions of the 2nd Amendment have at all changed the meaning of the actual performative.  \n\n* The \"hereby\" test changed nothing when added to the Right Clause, \nbut *did* change the meaning when added to the Militia Clause, proving that the Militia clause is not part of the performative.\n* I believe I thoroughly disproved that there is any appositive construction in the 2nd amendment.\n* The negation test seems to prove that the only possible negation that creates a reading that would allow for the banning of arms as some mean to do is a negation of the clause that we have proven to be the performative one.\n\n---\n\nNPI's\n---\nI *do* in fact have positive anymore.

I abstracted a little bit for the title of this post. Maybe it's better if I clarify a bit here.\nWhat this structure shows is that there is a clear cause-effect relationship between the two clauses.\n\n&gt; [A] A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, [B] the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\n\nIs it that case that if [A] is not true, [B] is still true?\n\nLet's say this:\n\n&gt; [A] Three rooms being necessary for a hose to be deemed \"livable\", [B] this house shall be declared livable.\n\nNote some interesting things about this:\n* Before the person uttered this sentence, \"this house\" did not have \"livable\" status. After, it did. This utterance changed something about the world (in the way that performative speech acts do. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performative_utterance ). This 2nd Ammendment is, I think, a performative construction.\n* Performatives in general allow \"hereby\" insertion. Can we insert \"hereby\" in this case?\n* &gt; A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms hereby shall not be infringed.\n\nWhat do you guys think of that insertion? Is there another place where \"hereby\" can be inserted and keep the meaning of the sentence? My judgement is that it's OK, and that since you can have \"hereby\" insertion in the 2nd ammendment, it behaves like the performatives.\n\nOr perhaps this is better:\n* &gt; A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall hereby  not be infringed.\n\nIf you disagree, that's important. As I've been thinking a lot about language for a long time, sometimes my judgements are off.\n\nNow, here we have an interesting point.\n\n&gt; The 2nd Amendment notes that the right to bear arms is for a well regulated militia.\n&gt; Not exactly. It states that the militia is necessary, and that the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall  &gt;not be infringed.\n \nNow, as passed by Congress:\n&gt;A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear &gt;Arms, shall not be infringed.\n\nHere we have something a little different. The \"being nessecary to the security of a free State\" appears to be in apposition of the determiner phrase \"a well regulated militia.\" However, we can note that appositives can often be deleted, as in:\n\n&gt; The President, Barack Obama, delivered the speech.\nbecomes, after apposition deletion,\n&gt; The President delivered the speech.\n\nNote that here apposition deletion doesn't work.\n&gt; A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear &gt;Arms, shall not be infringed.\ncannot yield:\n&gt;A well regulated Militia, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\n\nSo, it appears that \"being... State\" is not an appositive construction.\n\nIn each example you listed, the first clause appears to have a semantic relationship with the latter clause. \n\nNote that:\n&gt; [A] Frequent comparisons to the Nazis being harmful to rational discussion, [B] Mods are to ban anyone referring to Hitler from this forum.\n\nIn a situation where it is not the case that [A] is true, for [B] to be valid, [A] must have been true at some point in the past. Let's change [A] to [not A].\n\n&gt; [NEGATION TEST C] Frequent comparisons to the Nazis being beneficial to rational discussion, Mods are to ban anyone from referring to Hitler from this forum.\n\nIf this most recent statement were the policy, would you as a mod feel your duty to act on it?\n\nFor me, I have a strong negative reaction to the sentence [NEGATION TEST C]. I think it's because [A] is not true in the present and has never been true in the past.\n\nTherefore, I think for this type of construction to be considered linguistically valid (in the descriptive sense, of course, NOT a prescriptive one).\n\nWhat has come out of this little exercise for me (thanks for mentioning it, Pedant!), is that interestingly, we can see the behavior of NPI's that follows:\n\n&gt; * Frequent comparisons to Nazis being harmful to rational discussion, Mods are to ban anyone referring to Hitler from this forum anymore.\n&gt; ?

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_16zpuz", "selftext": "&gt; I've heard the bushmaster described as a varmint gun...\n\nWell, there are at least two things that might be going on here.  First, is that someone might have a slightly larger definition of \"varmint\" than I do.  Foxes? Coyotes? Feral Dogs? Wolves? All of those could be classified as \"varmints,\" and would be more humanely put down by a .223 Remington than a .22Long.  Alternately, some people just use overkill.  [Edit:  Another possibility?  They may call it that to offer a clearly legitimate purpose other than the charged, frankly propagandist, term \"assault weapon\"]\n\n&gt; why we're arming soldiers with varmint guns\n\nWell, we kind of are, and kind of aren't.  For one thing, just because the ammo is the same doesn't mean the gun is the same.  For example, you're familiar with the [Tommy Gun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_submachine_gun), right?  That uses the same exact round as the [1911 Colt Semiautomatic Pistol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1911_pistol), but they're *clearly* not the same weapon.  So while it may be said that they're using a varmint round, when you can literally fire off somewhere upwards of 6 rounds in a single second, that makes a bit of a difference.\n\nNext, take into account that as a caliber of choice to drive off feral dogs, coyotes, and wolves.  Human beings are not much tougher than your average wolf, and it could be argued that we are less so.  As a result, given the 1500+ J of energy being transfered, even with a \"bulletproof\" vest, somebody who gets hit with even *one* of those rounds is not going to be having their best day ever.  Will their body armor allow them to survive? Probably.  Will they be able to shrug it off like they do in the movies?  Not so much.  A .223 to the shoulder *can* kill (brachial artery), and even if it doesn't, can easily result in the loss of that arm.\n\nThird, the smaller round that has comparable efficacy at neutralizing threats allows for more ammunition to be carried per soldier.   When a soldier is only really capable of towing around 60-80 pounds of gear maximum, (warning: made up numbers forthcoming) would it be better that they carry 200 rounds capable of neutralizing an enemy, or 150?  If Bad Stuff\u2122 happens, as it often does in combat situations, US and NATO Militaries decided that it would be better to have something like 33% more rounds, each with a 15% lower probability of stopping the enemy than the other way around.\n\n&gt; one-handing shotguns and shooting targets\n\nI'm not certain I can comment on that.

For example, a [.50 Action Express,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.50_Action_Express) a pistol round, has a slug that is half an inch in diameter, but the overall length is only ~1.61\", while the [.50 BMG,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.50_BMG) an anti-materiel round (read: anti-tank, anti-engine block), has a slug that is also 0.50\" in diameter, but has an overall length of about 5.45\", with an actual bullet roughly 2.14\" in length, over half an inch longer than the entire round of the .50 AE.", "id": "t1_c8161jz", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "PerspicaciousPedant", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c816jf5", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sailorbrendan", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_16zpuz", "selftext": "&gt; I've heard the bushmaster described as a varmint gun...\n\nWell, there are at least two things that might be going on here.  First, is that someone might have a slightly larger definition of \"varmint\" than I do.  Foxes? Coyotes? Feral Dogs? Wolves? All of those could be classified as \"varmints,\" and would be more humanely put down by a .223 Remington than a .22Long.  Alternately, some people just use overkill.  [Edit:  Another possibility?  They may call it that to offer a clearly legitimate purpose other than the charged, frankly propagandist, term \"assault weapon\"]\n\n&gt; why we're arming soldiers with varmint guns\n\nWell, we kind of are, and kind of aren't.  For one thing, just because the ammo is the same doesn't mean the gun is the same.  For example, you're familiar with the [Tommy Gun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_submachine_gun), right?  That uses the same exact round as the [1911 Colt Semiautomatic Pistol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1911_pistol), but they're *clearly* not the same weapon.  So while it may be said that they're using a varmint round, when you can literally fire off somewhere upwards of 6 rounds in a single second, that makes a bit of a difference.\n\nNext, take into account that as a caliber of choice to drive off feral dogs, coyotes, and wolves.  Human beings are not much tougher than your average wolf, and it could be argued that we are less so.  As a result, given the 1500+ J of energy being transfered, even with a \"bulletproof\" vest, somebody who gets hit with even *one* of those rounds is not going to be having their best day ever.  Will their body armor allow them to survive? Probably.  Will they be able to shrug it off like they do in the movies?  Not so much.  A .223 to the shoulder *can* kill (brachial artery), and even if it doesn't, can easily result in the loss of that arm.\n\nThird, the smaller round that has comparable efficacy at neutralizing threats allows for more ammunition to be carried per soldier.   When a soldier is only really capable of towing around 60-80 pounds of gear maximum, (warning: made up numbers forthcoming) would it be better that they carry 200 rounds capable of neutralizing an enemy, or 150?  If Bad Stuff\u2122 happens, as it often does in combat situations, US and NATO Militaries decided that it would be better to have something like 33% more rounds, each with a 15% lower probability of stopping the enemy than the other way around.\n\n&gt; one-handing shotguns and shooting targets\n\nI'm not certain I can comment on that.  At least, not in an educated fashion.  \nI could *speculate* that they may have been smaller bore shotguns ([higher gague number](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-90b9pG-SyBI/Ts_VcPv7S0I/AAAAAAAAAGU/dOr3Ol97M2g/s1600/bore_size_shotgun_gauge.gif)), resulting in less energy being discharged.

I am always pleased to help educate people.\n\nSo, the rounds being fired in your video are [.22LR](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/.22_LR.jpg), commonly used for varmint hunting, etc.\n\nThe rounds used in an AR-15 (civilian version of the M16, which notably *cannot* fire full auto) are 5.56x54 NATO, seen [here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/GP90.jpg).  As you can see the slug itself is roughly 80% of the length of the full round (including casing and powder) of the .22LR.

The additional powder in that casing results in significantly more energy.\n\nAccording to Wiki, the highest energy you can get in a 22LR round is [277 J](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.22LR).  Compare that to the *lowest* energy of the 5.56 NATO round, at [1,679 J](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.56%C3%9745_mm_NATO), and you can see that an AR-15 is somewhere around 6 times the power.  Notice how in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oYJHw9t7Jc), the weapon is moving fairly significantly despite having not one point of stability (hand) but three (trigger hand, forward grip, shoulder contact).

There are a few very slight differences, but in terms of performance they might as well be identical. [Read more here if you are interested.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.56x45mm_NATO#5.56_mm_NATO_versus_.223_Remington)\n\n.223 is commonly used for varmint hunting and 5.56 is the standard rifle round for the U.S. (and every other NATO military, hence the name). Cartridges like the 5.56, called [intermediate cartridges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_cartridge) were developed around the end of WWII as an attempt to compromise between the range and power found in [battle rifle cartridges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_rifle) and the versatility of pistol-caliber [submachine guns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submachine_gun). The pistol rounds did not have enough range or stopping power to be useful in all situations and the full size rifle cartridges were too powerful to be easily controlled during full auto fire. Additionally, most combat occurs at ranges of less than 500 yards; full size rounds accurate to 1000 yards or more were overkill in most situations. Thus, a smaller rifle cartridge that was significantly more powerful and accurate to longer ranges than pistol rounds but not so powerful as to be overkill, like battle rifle rounds, was created and became pretty much the global standard for infantry rifles. They are also a lot lighter than battle rifle ammo, so you can carry a lot more of it at once. They are sufficient to kill or severely wound a man in most cases, good enough for military use. They are not considered sufficient for hunting large game, where ensuring a humane, swift kill is paramount. Big game hunters aren't concerned with the issues that drove the development of intermediate cartridges, so using a more powerful cartridge that will ensure a kill isn't a problem. For varmints the 5.56/.223 is more than enough to ensure humane kills. \n\nAs for one handing a rifle, let alone a shotgun, realize that shooting is something that requires a lot of skill. It is plenty difficult enough to hit a target with both hands, the people that can do it with one can do so because they have spent a ridiculous amount of time practicing that ability. The average person wouldn't be able to hit the broad side of a barn at close range with a rifle or a shotgun, it's a terrible way to shoot and pretty much only done as a form of showmanship.\n\nIf you can, why not go to a range one of these days and do some shooting? Take an NRA safety course or something like that. Even if it isn't your bag, you will have a greater understanding of the topic. You might even have fun.

Human beings are not much tougher than your average wolf, and it could be argued that we are less so.

The additional powder in that casing results in significantly more energy.\n\nAccording to Wiki, the highest energy you can get in a 22LR round is [277 J](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.22LR).  Compare that to the *lowest* energy of the 5.56 NATO round, at [1,679 J](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.56%C3%9745_mm_NATO), and you can see that an AR-15 is somewhere around 6 times the power.  Notice how in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oYJHw9t7Jc), the weapon is moving fairly significantly despite having not one point of stability (hand) but three (trigger hand, forward grip, shoulder contact).

There are a few very slight differences, but in terms of performance they might as well be identical. [Read more here if you are interested.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.56x45mm_NATO#5.56_mm_NATO_versus_.223_Remington)\n\n.223 is commonly used for varmint hunting and 5.56 is the standard rifle round for the U.S. (and every other NATO military, hence the name). Cartridges like the 5.56, called [intermediate cartridges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_cartridge) were developed around the end of WWII as an attempt to compromise between the range and power found in [battle rifle cartridges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_rifle) and the versatility of pistol-caliber [submachine guns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submachine_gun). The pistol rounds did not have enough range or stopping power to be useful in all situations and the full size rifle cartridges were too powerful to be easily controlled during full auto fire. Additionally, most combat occurs at ranges of less than 500 yards; full size rounds accurate to 1000 yards or more were overkill in most situations. Thus, a smaller rifle cartridge that was significantly more powerful and accurate to longer ranges than pistol rounds but not so powerful as to be overkill, like battle rifle rounds, was created and became pretty much the global standard for infantry rifles. They are also a lot lighter than battle rifle ammo, so you can carry a lot more of it at once. They are sufficient to kill or severely wound a man in most cases, good enough for military use. They are not considered sufficient for hunting large game, where ensuring a humane, swift kill is paramount. Big game hunters aren't concerned with the issues that drove the development of intermediate cartridges, so using a more powerful cartridge that will ensure a kill isn't a problem. For varmints the 5.56/.223 is more than enough to ensure humane kills. \n\nAs for one handing a rifle, let alone a shotgun, realize that shooting is something that requires a lot of skill. It is plenty difficult enough to hit a target with both hands, the people that can do it with one can do so because they have spent a ridiculous amount of time practicing that ability. The average person wouldn't be able to hit the broad side of a barn at close range with a rifle or a shotgun, it's a terrible way to shoot and pretty much only done as a form of showmanship.\n\nIf you can, why not go to a range one of these days and do some shooting? Take an NRA safety course or something like that. Even if it isn't your bag, you will have a greater understanding of the topic. You might even have fun.

For example, a [.50 Action Express,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.50_Action_Express) a pistol round, has a slug that is half an inch in diameter, but the overall length is only ~1.61\", while the [.50 BMG,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.50_BMG) an anti-materiel round (read: anti-tank, anti-engine block), has a slug that is also 0.50\" in diameter, but has an overall length of about 5.45\", with an actual bullet roughly 2.14\" in length, over half an inch longer than the entire round of the .50 AE.", "id": "t1_c8161jz", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "PerspicaciousPedant", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c816jf5", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sailorbrendan", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_16zpuz", "selftext": "&gt; I've heard the bushmaster described as a varmint gun...\n\nWell, there are at least two things that might be going on here.  First, is that someone might have a slightly larger definition of \"varmint\" than I do.  Foxes? Coyotes? Feral Dogs? Wolves? All of those could be classified as \"varmints,\" and would be more humanely put down by a .223 Remington than a .22Long.  Alternately, some people just use overkill.  [Edit:  Another possibility?  They may call it that to offer a clearly legitimate purpose other than the charged, frankly propagandist, term \"assault weapon\"]\n\n&gt; why we're arming soldiers with varmint guns\n\nWell, we kind of are, and kind of aren't.  For one thing, just because the ammo is the same doesn't mean the gun is the same.  For example, you're familiar with the [Tommy Gun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_submachine_gun), right?  That uses the same exact round as the [1911 Colt Semiautomatic Pistol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1911_pistol), but they're *clearly* not the same weapon.  So while it may be said that they're using a varmint round, when you can literally fire off somewhere upwards of 6 rounds in a single second, that makes a bit of a difference.\n\nNext, take into account that as a caliber of choice to drive off feral dogs, coyotes, and wolves.  Human beings are not much tougher than your average wolf, and it could be argued that we are less so.  As a result, given the 1500+ J of energy being transfered, even with a \"bulletproof\" vest, somebody who gets hit with even *one* of those rounds is not going to be having their best day ever.  Will their body armor allow them to survive? Probably.  Will they be able to shrug it off like they do in the movies?  Not so much.  A .223 to the shoulder *can* kill (brachial artery), and even if it doesn't, can easily result in the loss of that arm.\n\nThird, the smaller round that has comparable efficacy at neutralizing threats allows for more ammunition to be carried per soldier.   When a soldier is only really capable of towing around 60-80 pounds of gear maximum, (warning: made up numbers forthcoming) would it be better that they carry 200 rounds capable of neutralizing an enemy, or 150?  If Bad Stuff\u2122 happens, as it often does in combat situations, US and NATO Militaries decided that it would be better to have something like 33% more rounds, each with a 15% lower probability of stopping the enemy than the other way around.\n\n&gt; one-handing shotguns and shooting targets\n\nI'm not certain I can comment on that.  At least, not in an educated fashion.  \nI could *speculate* that they may have been smaller bore shotguns ([higher gague number](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-90b9pG-SyBI/Ts_VcPv7S0I/AAAAAAAAAGU/dOr3Ol97M2g/s1600/bore_size_shotgun_gauge.gif)), resulting in less energy being discharged.  I could also speculate that the larger bore may result in less \"kick\" for a given amount of energy.  I might speculate that the accuracy of a shotgun is not truly comparable given that shot (lots of pellets) expand, resulting in hits being scored despite unconrolable aim.   ...but all that is just that, speculation.  I simply don't know enough about the weapons in question, nor shotguns in general.\n\n&gt; Finally, thanks. I try real hard to be reasonably informed about stuff, but theres a lot of stuff to learn, so it's always nice when people will actually take the time to try and help. I also find it's good for facilitating discourse\n\nYou're quite welcome, and thank *you!*   I love sharing what knowledge I have.\n\nIt seems to me that a lot of the people who are trying to significantly change how firearms are dealt with in the US do so not simply in ignorance of what they mean to regulate, but precisely *because* of the ignorance.

This is a problem that [already exists](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZEMxSGxS4k), and having MMP would mean that roughly 1/2 of elected officials would be encouraged to ignore the desires of their constituency in favor of what their partisan masters want, and rewarded for doing so with higher rankings on their respective party lists.  In many ways, partisan election systems are an implementation of the dystopic scenario of giving corporations votes (especially if, hypothetically, a large portion of some political party or another happens to be bankrolled predominantly by a given corporation or industry).\n\nNo, better would be multiseat districts with STV or Range or some other multiseat, preferential voting system (ideally while significantly increasing the size of the House; I'm a fan of quintupling it, while keeping the same number of districts).\n\n**tl;dr: Candidates from the major parties would have even more incentive to turn their backs on their voters in favor of their corporate sponsors under Party based election systems (MMP, PL, etc).  Better would be preference based, multiseat districts.** ", "id": "t1_c7zbp56", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "PerspicaciousPedant", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_16slhp", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431005092, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7zbp56", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1358536384", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}

The banks and financial entities like AIG had debt obligations that far exceeded what a boost in mortgage income could have covered.

The cash injection into the economy wouldn't have occurred quickly enough to stop the financial \"contagion\" from spreading. \n\nAnd besides, I personally wouldn't feel that much better about my tax money going to people who (in some cases) irresponsibly took on too much debt. \n\nThat said, it does make sense to me to try and force banks to reach and agreement with homeowners reflecting the post-crash sale price of their homes, which has happened to some degree.

When congressional districts were only ~220k people (as it was when we last increased the size of the House), it was possible, if difficult, for someone in every family to have actually heard a candidate first hand.  An *actual* Town Hall meeting, with unscreened questions was possible.  Now, however, with half a million more people, how could that be done?  The costs, in both time and money, are prohibitive except for those who are already wealthy.\n2. Our voting system lends itself to candidates who appear electable more than those who're worth electing.  Just look at the republican primary.  Voters shifted from Perry to Cain, to Santorum for bacon's sake.  The only constant was Romney, who the media consistently spoke of as being electable and the only clear contender, despite the electorate looking for damn near anyone *but* him.  This, plus the [problems with First Past The Post](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo) mean that the rational voter is psychologically forced to abandon the candidates they would actually prefer for the deep pocket establishment candidates who \"have a chance,\" because otherwise their vote will be \"wasted.\"\n3. The media treat the population like it's stupid.  They speak of things as A or B, as though the american people can't actually process even three options.  The narrative in the GOP Primary was always Front-Runner-Du-Jour vs Romney.  Once Romney was the clear nominee, it was always Romney vs Obama (ignoring the other candidates).\n4. ...and the voting populace really is underinformed.  How many people can name more than one person on their congressional ballot this past year?  How many can't even name the one?  I honestly believe that the (near) universal suffrage in the US is a huge problem, because most people don't actually have the time to pay attention to who's running, let alone learn any actual information about them.\n\nAll of these things add up to elections based more on style than on substance, and celebrity candidates winning on charm and name recognition alone, something the average concerned citizen doesn't have the time/money/networking to develop.", "id": "t1_c7mdib4", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "PerspicaciousPedant", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_15gwy9", "score": 7, "retrieved_on": 1430775022, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_15gwy9", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7mdib4", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1356542926", "ups": 7, "distinguished": null}

The Conservative world view reflects the belief that traditions and principles that have survived the trial and error of centuries of civilization and have served us well, such as property rights, survive to this day because they work. Conservatives believe there are natural distinctions among men, leading to inequalities of condition. Conservatives affirm equality before God and the courts; anything more leads to servitude and boredom. They reject any notion of a classless society as unnatural. Russell Kirk wrote about these ideas some 60 years ago.\n\nConservatives believe that more so than evil or bad, human nature is weak and subject to its failings and passions. \n\n\"It is weakness rather than wickedness which renders men unfit to be trusted with unlimited power. The passions are all unlimited; nature has left them so; if they could be bounded, they would be extinct...They certainly increase, too, by exercise, like the body\". \nJohn Adams\n\nWe are a nation of laws not men.

We all appreciate the right to express and exchange ideas peaceably, to not have to house anyone against our will, privacy, due process, protection from self incrimination, public trial by jury, and protection from unreasonable punishments, right?  \n\nAren't we now complaining about warrantless wiretapping (should be illegal under the 4th), the de facto punishment of being groped at the airport when we say we don't want to go through the porno-scanner (possible violation of our 5th amendment rights against self-incrimination, under \"well, if you have nothing to hide...\" sort of bullshit), the ~~infinite~~ indefinite detention clause of the NDAA (in violation of the 6th, and possibly 8th), the attempts to fuck with the internet (which, IMO, should be protected under the 1st amendment guarantee of freedom of the press)... Hell, even Roe v Wade was decided on privacy grounds, which is a (proper) extrapolation of the 4th amendment (possibly via the 9th).\n\nSo no, I cannot imagine that they expected those rights to become irrelevant.\n\nAs to why people refer to it, though...

They point out that these shootings are one in several million occurrences, that for every life taken with a firearm, numerous crimes are prevented, with sources to prove it, and they are ignored.\n\nSo, when reason fails to win over emotion, they fall back to \"It doesn't matter that you think I'm wrong, because the law is on my side.\"\n\nThey're effectively saying \"I'm tired of dealing with you, if you want to *change* that law, go ahead, get 3/4 of the states to agree with you, but until you do, your desires don't matter, legally.\"", "id": "t1_c7kikf3", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "PerspicaciousPedant", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_159cn5", "id": "t1_c7kydhs", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "level1", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I agree that this is the correct answer.\n\nAlso, it's worse than that.
