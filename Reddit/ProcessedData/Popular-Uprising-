Two, part of my company's business is explaining ACA changes to small businesses and incorporating those changes into our software package. Costs are going up for all insurance companies and businesses that provide insurance. \n\nIt makes logical sense to me. The ACA requires that insurance companies provide a long list of 'preventative' and other care with no out of pocket expense to the customer. This cost must be offset somewhere. They also require that the insurance company take pre-existing conditions. Those customers can only be a cost to the insurance company and they need to recoup that cost somewhere. The ACA also mandates quite a bit more reporting and compliance for the insurance companies. The cost to implement and comply with it will also be passed down to the customer. \n\nThis also doesn't include the additional cost to the businesses that must somehow comply with all of the rules and regulations in the ACA. We've spent well over 100K re-writing code and advising our clients how to comply with the ACA.

One, the health insurance people who came to our office to explain why they rose so much showed us their cost/profit graphs and outlined several provisions in the ACA that were responsible for it. Two, part of my company's business is explaining ACA changes to small businesses and incorporating those changes into our software package. Costs are going up for all insurance companies and businesses that provide insurance. \n\nIt makes logical sense to me. The ACA requires that insurance companies provide a long list of 'preventative' and other care with no out of pocket expense to the customer. This cost must be offset somewhere. They also require that the insurance company take pre-existing conditions. Those customers can only be a cost to the insurance company and they need to recoup that cost somewhere. The ACA also mandates quite a bit more reporting and compliance for the insurance companies. The cost to implement and comply with it will also be passed down to the customer. \n\nThis also doesn't include the additional cost to the businesses that must somehow comply with all of the rules and regulations in the ACA. We've spent well over 100K re-writing code and advising our clients how to comply with the ACA. This cost is passed down to our customers and they have additional costs trying to make sure that they comply. \n\n\n\n", "id": "t1_ccx15dy", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Popular-Uprising-", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_ccwwm56", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429028568, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1oxd5l", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ccx15dy", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1382443422", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1oxd5l", "id": "t1_ccx531g", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "draftermath", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_ccxckpm", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "motorsizzle", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_ccx531g", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429023094, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1o7r0a", "selftext": "Since nobody else is responding, I will. Hopefully I won't get downvoted and blasted.\n\nI'm a registered Republican and someone who's trying to work to reform the Republican party from within. I support mostly Libertarian-leaning candidates, and many Tea-party candidates. I think this shut down is a good thing and I hope that the Republicans hold firm for several reasons.\n\n1. It brings attention to the healthcare debate. The ACA (Obamacare) is not a good law. While some provisions are reasonable, it has caused insurance rates to skyrocket, its implementation has been horrible, it is quite possible to have caused loss in hours worked and loss of jobs, many large companies have been exempted, the entire employer mandate has been delayed for a year, and individuals are going to be fined for not getting insurance when employers aren't required to offer it and the exchanges aren't working.\n\n2. It brings the inter-party divide to the forefront. The establishment Republicans that want big government, more power, high spending, and just a different set of corporate cronies helped are set at odds with the Republicans that actually believe in smaller government, fiscal responsibility, and more personal freedom. As the chorus of establishment Republicans call for a compromise that keeps the entire ACA and has superficial concessions, the Republican base gets to see who they are and what they really stand for. IMO, it's big-government cronyism and imposing their own social/moral code on others. \n\n3. It shows the American people just how little we actually need many of the functions that the Federal government provides. It gets them thinking about alternate ways to accomplish the same goals and how it would be possible to return many of those powers and functions to the states. Unless you're getting paid by the Federal government, you life has been impacted very little by the shutdown.\n\n4. When things settle down and the deal is finally struck, people will remember that only one party tried to stand up for less spending, a less powerful government, and a repeal of the awful ACA. \n\nAs for who I blame? I blame both parties fairly equally. The Republicans have certainly pushed this issue to this point and thus have a large share of the responsibility, but the Democrats have refused to negotiate, refused to compromise, and refused to give up on any of their demands despite the fact that even they agree that the ACA has been a train wreck so far. It seems blindingly obvious to me that requiring individuals to get insurance while exempting their employers from providing it will force very large numbers of people into the exchanges and cost them a lot of money. The exchanges that aren't working properly and may take many months to fix. \n\nI know that many Republicans don't agree with me. In talking to my more establishment-type Republican associates, most believe that the Republicans in the House are probably making a good point, but their strategy is flawed and it won't amount to anything. There is a real fear that people will dislike the party even more after this is all over. The consensus is that the the Democrats are mostly to blame for their refusal to talk about fixing the law or negotiate a delay in the implementation.", "id": "t1_ccpk8pa", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Popular-Uprising-", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_ccpkbjd", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "mors_videt", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Can you elaborate how you believe this is dirty pool?

It has been at the forefront of every political debate and conversation. \n\nWhy is there a need to hold the CR and debt ceiling debates hostage in order to \u201cbring attention\u201d to something the entire country is already focused on?\n\n\n&gt;The ACA (Obamacare) is not a good law. \n\nThis is your opinion many others would disagree. And while you may be right. Wouldn't it be better to come up with a better solution and implement that to try and replace the ACA then blindly try to remove it without offering any alternatives?\n\n&gt;it has caused insurance rates to skyrocket\n\nThis is disingenuous. [The ACA has caused only about a 1 percent to 3 percent increase in premiums, according to several independent experts.](http://www.factcheck.org/2011/10/factchecking-health-insurance-premiums/)\n\nThat is not skyrocketing. \n\nYou also forget to mention that the reason for the increase in premiums is due to new benefits that weren't had before such as:\n\n* Cover preventive care without copays or deductibles.\n* Allow adult children to stay on parents\u2019 policies until age 26.\n* Increase annual coverage limits.\n* Cover children without regard for preexisting conditions.\nIn fact benefits like no copays or deductibles and increased coverage limits will save each person on the annual costs they spend out of pocket to the doctor.\n\n&gt;its implementation has been horrible\n\nPoor implementation does not equate to the law being horrible. You can implement a horrible law quite well or implement a Good law poorly.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe the implementation of the ACA might of gone over much smoother if Republicans and Tea Partiers weren't purposely setting up any road blocks they could to purposely make it fail.\n\n&gt;**it is quite possible** to have caused loss in hours worked and loss of jobs\n\nSo a law is not good because of something that isn't proven?\n\nIt is also quite possible that there were no loss of hours or jobs due to the ACA.\n\n&gt;many large companies have been exempted, the entire employer mandate has been delayed for a year\n\nThis is more of proof of our failed government officials not that the ACA is a poor law. There should have been no reason to delay this mandate other than to give Big Businesses a tax break for one more year and is an obvious move to appease lobbyists and donators.\n\n&gt;and individuals are going to be fined for not getting insurance when employers aren't required to offer it and the exchanges aren't working.\n\n\nThough it is unfair that they delayed the Employer mandate again this isn't a failure of the ACA, if it was fully implemented this wouldn't be a problem. Instead it is a problem of our government allowing Big Businesses to once again get away with 'murder'.\n\n[As for the healthcare exchange. It is working fine as of now.](https://www.healthcare.gov/)\n\nIt may have had glitches in the beginning but any site that had 2.8  million people visit it the first day would.\n\nIf Apple's website crashed because 2.8 million people tried to buy the new Iphone we'd be talking about how successful a business model they have but since the ACA website crashed it is a failure of the law!\n\n\n&gt;     It brings the inter-party divide to the forefront. The establishment Republicans that want big government, more power, high spending, and just a different set of corporate cronies helped are set at odds with the Republicans that actually believe in smaller government, fiscal responsibility, and more personal freedom. As the chorus of establishment Republicans call for a compromise that keeps the entire ACA and has superficial concessions, the Republican base gets to see who they are and what they really stand for. IMO, it's big-government cronyism and imposing their own social/moral code on others.\n\nThis is what campaigning and elections are for. The inter-party issues should be decided during elections by the voters. A small portion of a party shouldn't take the country hostage because they want to show the rest of the country they don't like what is going on.\n\n&gt;  Unless you're getting paid by the Federal government, you life has been impacted very little by the shutdown.\n\n\n\n* Unless your on Social Security or Medicare which though is still being paid out is being delayed. I am sure every who relies on these checks can last a month or two before they get their money though, its not like it pays their rent or buys their food.\n\n* Hope you aren't being discriminated on the job because the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\n*The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are facing a reduced ability to detect and investigate disease outbreaks. The annual influenza program \u2013 the one that tracks the flu and helps people get flu shots \u2013 has been shut down. But nobody gets the Flu!\n\n* Now that The Wic program, which provides low-income pregnant women, new mothers and children up to the age of five with healthy food, is not funded; I am sure there isn't a single mother having problems getting formula for their infant or food for their children.\n\n* Apparently the millions who are getting paid by the federal government don't matter for some reason. It's not like they are normal every day citizens like me or you, of course their suffering isn't taken into account.\n\n&gt;     When things settle down and the deal is finally struck, people will remember that only one party tried to stand up for less spending, a less powerful government, and a repeal of the awful ACA.\n\nOr they will remember that one Party decided to hold the CR and debt ceiling hostage due to their opinions on the ACA which had NOTHING to do with the CR or the debt ceiling.\n \n", "id": "t1_ccrl665", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Filbert_Turtle", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; This is disingenuous.

Our elected representatives did whatever they considered politically expedient in order to get re-elected and remain in power. \n\nDuring and after WWII, there were government price-controls in place that made it illegal for employers to offer higher wages in order to compete for employees. In order to attract more and better employees, employers began offering more and better benefits to prospective employees. One of those benefits was employee-provided healthcare/insurance. Most large companies followed suit and even medium and small companies had to offer these benefits in order to compete.\n\nOver time, it was politically expedient for politicians to who show wonderful and caring they were by creating more tax incentives and laws to prop up and support the employer-provided healthcare model. Since they also got campaign contributions from insurance companies and healthcare providers, they got extra bang for their buck by demagoging the issue.\n\nAs for how to fix it, that depends on your political ideology. \n\nConservatives generally want a free-market model and want to remove barriers to purchasing insurance across state lines, make it easier to fund and use Health savings accounts, give individuals the same tax breaks that companies get, and reduce regulations that drive competition out of the market. The problem with this solution is that it's difficult to convince people that it will work. Those that want a single-payer system will fight this solution to the bitter end.\n\nLiberals generally want a single-payer system where the government acts as the middle-man for all healthcare transactions. The problem with this system is that it puts the government in the middle of all healthcare decisions and actions. It removes the profit incentive for innovation in the medical field and mostly removes competition from the market place. It has been shown to work in several countries, but may not work here in the US because of our vast, diverse population and because there will no longer be a country like the US to foot the bill for medical innovation and pharmacy costs. \n", "id": "t1_cbrs1cn", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Popular-Uprising-", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1kqx4e", "id": "t1_cbrt3v7", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1kqx4e", "selftext": "What controls would be in place to ensure employers converted the equivalent of coverage cost to salary?

Instead of the government operating as a single payer, and leveraging its huge buying power to lower costs and offer more services the way (forgive the terrible analogy) Walmart or Costco does, they use the same money, break it into tiny pieces and give it to employers, who pass it on to employees who spend it in the market.  The same dollar gets spent but has to pass through many hands.  It seems likely a larger company with more employees could capitalize in the marketplace with better rates and more services because of the number of customers they bring to the insurer, thus creating a disparity between persons who work for an advantageous company and ones who work for small businesses, and a further disparity for those without employment or self-employment.  \n\nThe argument made above is that a single-payer system inhibits innovation, though I don't know if that's necessarily true.  It seems likely that a pharmaceutical or medical technology company would still be incentivized to create or innovate, especially with an extraordinarily large customer like the federal government at hand, but there could still be room for the market to decide on medicines and treatments if doctors have the freedom to make those decisions with their patients.  There is no shortage of innovation in the military-industrial complex and they essentially have one buyer.  That might be another bad analogy.\n\n&gt;Some corporations and insurance companies are already trying to work out incentive systems based around these behaviors.\n\nWhen I first got life insurance I was charged more for my premiums because of my weight.  I was told that if I lost the weight I could be re-evaluated and have my premiums lowered.  I've since lost the weight, but I've also cancelled the insurance, but the difference in cost wasn't a sufficient motivator.  I lost weight for the reason a lot of people do, I wanted to look better and get more dates.  That's all anecdotal, of course, but I only mean that a small amount of money wasn't enough for me to make healthy decisions I should have been making for myself.  I only mention that as it pertains to incentive systems.

As /u/PoliSciUgGuy already laid out, your taxes are paying for it either way.  Either as subsidies to employers who pay for health coverage for their employees, or in the form of Medicare and Medicade which cover those who qualify for those plans.  Taxes are paying for those things whether the government becomes the payer or distributes tax revenue back to employers in an employer-pay model.  There are times when we are each a participant in the free market and others when we are one nation, with national interests.  I would argue that healthcare, as much as any other issue, is a national interest and requires collective action.  One standard for all, just like each American receives the same military defense, the same legal status, the same civil protections, the same access to infrastructure.  I appreciate, though, that many don't agree.  It does create a nanny state, and there is little incentive to respect the cost of healthcare when it is guaranteed to you.  Why should anyone feel obligated to eat well and exercise when heart bypass surgery and comprehensive rehab is covered by the state?  The argument that it is in their interest has long since failed, since we're getting fatter all the time, and McDonalds revenues are at record highs.  Few seem capable of making the sacrifices that are in their best interests.\n\nYou also say 'give' a lot.  People don't 'give' their money to the government, they pay taxes.  Give implies they had some sort of choice and benevolently chose to contribute.  This misconception stems from the fact that a person likely receives a paycheck of some sort and has their taxes aportioned out based on their income.  That money that is collected in tax was never theirs.  It is not a gift or a tithe, a person's pay is the portion remaining after taxes.  This is the price we pay for national defense and critical infrastructure, roads, schools, police officers, etc.  Every salary, as well as the cost of every good and service, necessarily includes the understanding that the gross represents both the personal take and the government's portion, and changing the tax rate is merely the renegotiation of that division.  If the tax system were changed so that no American ever paid taxes, the employer would simply pay the government and salary would be reduced proportionately.

Will they quit smoking, eat healthier and exercise more because they see the money coming off their check or receive a new bill each month in the mail?

I imagine in practice the Wyden plan would affect each person very differently depending upon how they used the extra salary money and government subsidy.

There was actually a [plan](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_big_idea/2007/02/better_health_through_politics.2.html) proposed pre-PPACA by Sen. Ron Wyden that would have given everyone more control over their health care and moved away from the employer based system. Unfortunately, it never got any traction before Obama launched his plan, and we're still stuck with a variant of the WWII/accidental system.\n\n&gt;Under Wyden's plan, employers would no longer provide health coverage, as they have since World War II. Instead, they'd convert the current cost of coverage into additional salary for employees. Individuals would use this money to buy insurance, which they would be required to have. Private insurance plans would compete on features and price but would have to offer benefits at least equivalent to the Blue Cross \"standard\" option. Signing up for insurance would be as easy as ticking off a box on your tax return. In most cases, insurance premiums would be withheld from paychecks, as they are now.\n\n&gt;Eliminating employers as an additional payer would encourage consumers to use health care more efficiently. Getting rid of the employer tax deduction, which costs a whopping $200 billion a year, would free up funds to subsidize insurance up to 400 percent of the poverty line, which is $82,000 for a family of four.

Higher density means much less infastructure cost per patient. Just to throw out some numbers, lets say that an average population will need 1 hospitial bed within 10 miles per 1000 people. The UK has a population density of 673/sq mile, compared to the US's 89. So in the 10 mile radius around a hospital, the UK has 211500 citizens vs 28000 in the US. The hospital with only 28 bed still needs the equipment available to deal with most of the same diseases as the large hospital, but much of it will only be used occationally, or for a handful of patients. \n\nObviously, there are limits. You wouldn't have a fully staffed hospital for a town of 500 people in Montana. With that said, the regional hospital should be reachable quickly in an emergency, which could require helicopters or other modes of transport, which also add to costs. \n\nThen there is the fact that different populations have very different health needs. Caucasians have much higher risk of skin cancer, while blacks have a higher rate of animia. Colorado doesn't natively have deer ticks, but the doctors there still need to be able to diagnose lymes disease if a patient visited the north east. The moer similar the health needs are in a population, the more the health services can specialize and cut waste spending.\n\nBrazil's system is probably the most analagous to the US, if you would like to look into these issues more.

People like to be close minded and hate to examine their beliefs. \n\n&gt;In short, you're misapplying the fallacy to imply that because Heritage hasn't formally been proven wrong in this specific case, we should assume that they're right.\n\nThat's not what I'm arguing at all. I'm arguing that no opinion should be summarily dismissed simply because disagree with the ideology of the source. But nice straw man. \n\n&gt;Now here's something you may not know about. In Rhetoric there is the concept of Ethos, which along with Logos and Pathos forms the modes of persuasion. The short definition of Ethos is that the listener has to trust the speaker. I don't trust the Heritage Foundation.\n\nI'm not asking you to.

We can't sell enough government bonds to finance our deficit spending, so the FED prints money and buys government debt with it. What this does is inflates the money supply and undermines the value of the dollar. The only reasons that inflation isn't running rampant are the facts that the US dollar is still the world's reserve currency, other country's money is tied to the dollar, and many are also printing money. \n\nThe problem is that there's no real way out of the mess. At some point, the US dollar will be so undermined that other countries will stop buying it (already happening) and stop using it as the reserve currency (already starting to happen). Once inflation takes hold, the normal response is to stop printing money and raise interest rates. We no longer have that option. If we stop printing money, the US government can no longer keep running a deficit. If we raise interest rates, the US government can no longer afford to service the debt. \n\nThe net result is that inflation will lock in and the US government will either have to drastically raise (nearly double) taxes or default on the debt. Either action will cause inflation and a huge economic hit.
