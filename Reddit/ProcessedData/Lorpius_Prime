Trade does not flow easily through the place, which hinders economic development relative to the rest of the world.  Until very recently, the geography also kept the region's people pretty isolated and divided because transport and communication were so difficult.\n\nThe region's conquest and rule by the Russian Empire and Soviet Union was simultaneously the best and the worst thing to happen to the people there.  It was bad, obviously, because the Russians were not very nice to the natives, and pretty much completely razed the societies there in order to impose their own rulers and organization.  But it was also good, because they became attached to a huge industrialized economy which transferred in lots of wealth and opportunities that the regional economy would be hard-pressed to afford on its own.\n\nThen in the 1990s the whole thing just disappeared.  The collapse of the Soviet Union cut off the subsidies *and* access to many of the civil institutions which had supported their (relatively) open society.  Autocratic governments emerged, usually centered on whatever Soviet governor had been running the place at the moment of the collapse, mostly because they were the only authorities around with even marginally legitimate claims to command the remnants of the military and security services still in-country.\n\nFrom that point forward, the lack of economic diversity has tended to strengthen the hand of dictators rather than promote general development.  The economies in the region are heavily dominated by resource extraction and agriculture, both of which tend to encourage concentrate wealth because they don't require lots of skilled labor and local trade to support.  So it's easy for political elites, by controlling those industries, to wield a disproportionate amount of economic power relative to more diversified economies, which just reinforces their political power.\n\nIn the end, I think the currently dismal situation is most likely just a brief phase in the history of these countries rather than a permanent state of affairs.  Remember that most of these countries have only been independent for a single generation or so.  Their geography will always work against them becoming super-wealthy (barring some extremely provident natural resource discovery), but they should gradually become more integrated into the global transport and communication networks, which will push them towards political and economic development.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1v53j5", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1v53j5", "selftext": "Russia has no political motivation to subsidize these countries now that they're independent, for the same reasons that the United States doesn't offer Social Security to Haitians.

Administration is therefore very ad-hoc and amateurish, and power is built almost entirely on personal and familial relationships, rather than civil traditions or bureaucratic rules and institutions simply because those things have not had time to develop.\n\nNow that the Sudanese government in Khartoum is no longer a serious threat to their independence, internal divisions, especially among different tribes, have increased.  The President and Vice-President were from different large tribes, and had increasingly become political opponents.  But since there's no entrenched tradition of democratic resolutions to political conflicts, there was significant tension and fear that any contest between them would be fought with violence and force of arms rather than by votes.  Apparently last week that tension bubbled over into actual fighting, as rumors of the Vice-President being arrested prompted a violent reaction from his tribesmen, which was interpreted as an attempted coup by the President's faction, with the result that both sides have now ended up in an *actual* fight.\n\nMost of the immediate details I got from the Economist's [article](http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21591896-factional-violence-new-country-may-be-getting-out-control-two-elephants) on the conflict, which is now several days out of date, so I can't speak to how the military situation has evolved over the last few days.

It's still up in the air whether they will be making *more* money than they were before.  But the tentative expectation is that they will, since they're supposed to have a larger pool of members, which is why insurance companies tended to favor the ACA's mandate model of reform.\n\nIf the system works as intended, sicker-than-average people will face lower medical costs than they would have before (though they may still pay more than they would have, if previous costs were so high that they never actually paid anything).  They will earn what an economist would call a \"profit\" from their insurance, but laymen might not since it isn't in the form of cash revenue.\n\nConversely, healthier-than-average people can expect higher medical costs than they would have faced otherwise.  They're the low-risk pool, which subsidizes the other members in any insurance scheme.  They may still \"profit\" from the ACA, but it will be because of potential benefits to the larger economy (a healthier population is more productive, and therefore has the potential to make everyone in society better off), rather than in the form of direct value from their medical care.\n\nIf you're talking about the government's balance sheet, \"profit\" isn't really a meaningful concept.  The *hope* is that it will generate more revenue than expenditures for the government, but there are aspects which push in both directions.  The ACA includes a lot of subsidies for lower-income people to purchase health insurance, which is an expansion of government obligations.

In my experience, most economists would rather just do away with it altogether (or at least in the form that's usually applied in the US), but there are multiple reasons.  At least one person here has said that corporations just pass any taxation onto consumers; that's a common argument but it's not always true.  That *can* happen, but sometimes only partially, and sometimes not at all, depending on various market factors.  A more common argument among economists is that it's often very easy for corporations to evade taxes with complicated legal structures and maneuvers, so that corporate taxes end up generating more revenue for tax lawyers and accountants than they do for governments.  At the same time, it's harder for *individuals* to avoid taxes to the same degree; so that in the end it makes more sense to just tax individuals directly, since all corporate profits eventually go into *someone's* pocket.

That situation will be exacerbated if the flow of aid money to Afghanistan dries up, as has the potential to happen if agreements are not secured and/or when international attention on the country fades.\n\nThe Karzai administration has been unhappy with the US lately.  The US wants the government to at least attempt some kind of peace negotiations with the Taliban, while the government is staunchly opposed, and feels like they're being sold out.  Negotiations with the United States over military assistance after 2014 have been drawn out, mostly over the issues of US military immunity from Afghan law, and a \"security guarantee\" where the US would promise to defend Afghanistan against attack by another nation.  Afghanistan is deeply suspicious of Pakistan, which it believes assists the Taliban as part of its efforts to control Afghanistan; but the US refuses to contemplate any agreement which could conceivably commit it to fighting Pakistan in order to defend Afghanistan.  The impasse over the security agreement may have just recently ended, as President Karzai agreed to call an assembly of the country's tribal leaders to discuss it before submitting the deal to the parliament; but it's not clear whether the agreement will be approved by either organization.  If it fails, Afghanistan may lose critical American military and financial support, and be largely abandoned to its own devices as Iraq was in 2010.", "id": "t1_cda2bn0", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Lorpius_Prime", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1q7ef6", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1428733621, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cda2bn0", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1383958917", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}

A minority of Republicans might be willing to join with Democrats on a specific bill, but they're going to be *much* more hesitant to undermine the power of their party in general (as would Democrats in the reverse situation).", "id": "t1_ccvx3gw", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Lorpius_Prime", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ougkb", "id": "t1_ccw7p24", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Frederic64", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Most Americans are probably not well informed about the workings of Congress beyond the level of \"they're an assembly of representatives that pass laws\".

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Okay, well, **yes**, it's \"important\".  But it's not, by itself, a critical indicator of much of anything.  The size of the debt is proportional to the amount of interest which has to be paid in the government budget.  Debt represents a relationship with creditors, notably with foreign financiers, who facilitate the lucrative trade which occurs among various nations.\n\nThere is evidence that countries with higher national debts have lower economic growth.  But it's not a steep relationship (and there's no big cliff at 90% debt-to-GDP ratio, as a recently discredited economic paper implied).  It's not entirely clear what the cause of that relationship is, and it may simply be that more profligate nations tend to also have other ineffectual policies which retard growth, or that low growth tends to increase debt.\n\nOne simple model of national debt that I was taught when first studying economics suggests that debt causes \"crowding out\" of investment spending.  The idea is that countries pay higher and higher interest rates in order to keep borrowing so much, and as a result investors start preferring to put their money in government bonds (for the high return) rather than riskier private investments; as a result, the private economy is starved for credit and does not grow to its potential.  This is a plausible-sounding theory, and a lot of people who've learned very basic economics are aware of it... but there does not seem to be much hard evidence supporting it.  Interest rates on government debt actually seem to have very little relationship to the size of government debt, and are more probably driven by more intangible issues of perception.\n\nIt's also important to be aware that the United States, as well as many more developed countries, has its own central bank and currency.  So long as that central bank is acting responsibly, it is very nearly *impossible* for the United States to go bankrupt and default on its debt for lack of credit.  The Federal Reserve can loan the US Treasury an infinite amount of money at any interest rate.  In normal situations, it doesn't need or *want* to, for various reasons of economic health; but in an emergency, it is supposed to act as a \"lender of last resort\" in order to keep the government financially sound.  Dramatic pursuit of such policies would reduce the value of US debt and dollars relative to the past and other assets, so old creditors would be very unhappy.  But it's usually seen as better than outright bankruptcy.\n\nNot all countries have or have always had that same safety valve.  Before widespread adoption of freely-floating fiat currencies, many countries used currencies which were exchangeable for gold (and sometimes silver).  Bankruptcy was a very real concern in that situation, because countries could and did run out of gold reserves to pay off their creditors.  If your national debt is denominated in a currency like gold, which you can't easily devalue in a pinch, then the size of the debt is a *very* big concern.  This sort of situation is what's driving the ongoing economic crisis in Europe.  Several European nations are either bankrupt, or teetering right on the verge of bankruptcy.  But because they are members of the Euro zone, which currency they do not directly control, they cannot easily escape their crushing levels of debt by devaluing.  So in order to keep paying their debts, they are being forced to make drastic cuts to government spending and apply tax hikes.  \n\nBut since the United States has the Fed and the Dollar, we don't have to worry about that particular problem.\n\nOn the other hand, we've got the statutory debt ceiling, which might mean we default on our debt for other silly reasons.\n\nHope that makes things a little clearer.", "id": "t1_cat0pys", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Lorpius_Prime", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1hcbnr", "selftext": "this should be top comment. great post.", "id": "t1_cat8bnj", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "jkovach89", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cat0pys", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1430631589, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cat8bnj", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1372611474", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t3_1hcbnr", "score": 20, "retrieved_on": 1430635243, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1hcbnr", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cat0pys", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1372569111", "ups": 20, "distinguished": null}

Crime? There are alternative methods and the biggest problem we have right now is improper lab work matching known samples to samples taken falsely. Can you imagine the problem when they get to run through databases 100000x as large, the false positive match will soar. And crime should not be the prerogative of the federal government.\n\nVoting fraud is almost non-existant, so there is no argument to be made there.

For example, right now India is going through the largest biometric identification programs ever, getting retinal scans of *all* its citizens, because it needs a better way to distribute welfare benefits than product subsidies, make-work, and grants to hideously corrupt local rulers.  Having biometric IDs of everyone will allow them to distribute simple cash benefits directly to citizens without fear of diversion or repeat payments.\n\nThe thing about trusting government is that we *have* to do it.  Not because government *is* trustworthy, but because government is so immensely *useful* to large societies like we have become, that we're screwed without them.  So the challenge for those societies is to design robust government institutions and to maintain vigilant monitoring to ensure that the government behaves the way it ought to.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ed6pi", "selftext": "The geography would make any kind of large war between those two countries a formidable logistical conundrum.  They can lob missiles and try to fly sorties against each other.  But any military contact beyond that would require marching troops across several international boundaries (geopolitically complicated), sailing ships through the Suez Canal (just as politically complicated and of questionable military wisdom), or else sailing the long way across the Mediterranean and around Africa (logistical nightmare).  Even airstrikes would get iffy pretty quickly since none of the intervening countries are likely to be happy about their airspace being used that way, and the air defenses of both combatants would be a serious threat to the air forces of each other once they move to a war footing.\n\nHonestly, I just can't see a serious conventional war happening between Iran and Israel in isolation.  If war ever *was* provoked somehow, such as by an Israeli surprise attack against Iranian nuclear facilities, or an Iranian proxy like Hezbollah doing something very stupid, then I think it would either quickly escalate into a larger conflict, or else descend into a bitter stalemate like Israel has often had with its Arab neighbors.\n\nThe regional countries most likely to get drawn in on the Iranian side would be Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Egypt, in order of decreasing likelihood.  And even so, all of them would be highly reluctant to get involved, it'd take a serious breakdown in the international order and some provocations to actually get any of those countries shooting at Israel again as belligerents.  But if Israel started, say, bombing Iranian weapons convoys passing through Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, the governments of those countries might eventually get so fed up as to declare war; similar story for Lebanon if Israel tried another invasion or bombing campaign against Hezbollah on its territory.  With Egypt, there seems to be a small but real possibility of rapproachement with Iran under the new government.  This makes it *conceivable* that they could go back to war, though it would probably take serious fumbling on the part of the United States and provocations from Israel, such as mining or blocking the Suez Canal against Iranian shipping.  Oh, if you count Palestine as a country, they might get involved too, Hamas and the other Gaza factions before the government in the West Bank.\n\nFor Jordan and the Gulf States I see basically zero possibility of ever siding with Iran in a war, even against Israel.  Though it's not out of the realm of possibility that some of their governments could face internal collapse or civil war in the event that their populations became sufficiently outraged; Jordan is probably most vulnerable to such an event.  Otherwise, there's a possibility that they could take some covert or indirect measures in support of Israel against Iran... or possibly declare their own independent war as their best opportunity to humble Tehran, especially the Saudis and Emirates.\n\nOutside the region, the United States is the most likely nation to get sucked into the conflict, followed distantly by Russia.  But even Washington is going to be desperate to stay the hell out (especially if we're still in the Obama administration).  That may not be possible, however.  The Iranians may well assume--not unreasonably--that the United States will back Israel to the hilt, and try to attack the US Navy in the Persian Gulf.  Indeed, a very quick surprise attack would probably be their best hope of doing any serious damage.  But that will guarantee at least limited direct involvement by the US military to destroy the Iranian Navy, as well as probably to destroy Iranian air defenses in order for the US to launch its own strikes against nuclear or other military infrastructure.  Beyond that, though, there will still be extreme reluctance to actually attempt any sort of invasion of Iranian territory.  That could leave Iran in a similar situation to Iraq after the Gulf War, facing no-fly-zones and an embargo of their physical trade with other countries in addition to the financial sanctions that have been paining them lately.\n\nUltimately, I don't think there's any plausible scenario where either country \"wins\" such a war, they can't really get at each other, so there's nothing that they can really acquire from a victory.  On the other hand, it's possible that Iran could *lose* the war in a much more debilitating way than Israel if the United States gets involved.  Israel could still suffer some serious destruction, however, from Iranian bombardment or attacks by guerilla proxies, or else from screwing up so badly that one or more of their actual neighbors joins in.\n\nAnyway, ugly but limited war, and not one from which I can foresee anything good emerging.", "id": "t1_c9z4ye0", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Lorpius_Prime", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1ed6pi", "score": 7, "retrieved_on": 1431151845, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9z4ye0", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1368607850", "ups": 7, "distinguished": null}

It's hard to make absolute judgments about whether moderates are better or worse than radicals, as a lot depends on context.

But it helps in proportion to your ability to influence their election.  One call from a normal constituent won't have a noticeable impact, but calls from thousands of constituents can.  The problem is that if *everyone* gives up without trying because they think \"my lone voice won't matter\", then they're already defeated.\n\n2) A vote for a third party is *not* (necessarily) a vote against your interests.  I know that's a popular message in the public political discourse, but it's really an oversimplified and somewhat garbled interpretation of a legitimate principle of political science.  Single-representative districts and first-past-the-post voting in the United States do skew election outcomes and favor a two-party system, but it's not an iron lock and it only truly favors two candidates *per district*, not two parties throughout the whole nation.  Keep in mind that US elections have *always* operated by these rules, and there have been many successful third parties and independent candidates.  Your vote is the most direct influence you can have on an election, short of running yourself, and if you don't vote for the candidates you believe in then you're contributing to the election of candidates you don't like.  So my advice is don't worry about the strategic voting: if you find a candidate or a party which shares your belief much better than one of the big brands, *vote for them*.  And give the finger to anyone who complains that you ruined the election for someone else; if they wanted your vote, they should have earned it from you.\n\nOkay, as to your first question: **How do we stand up for ourselves?**\n\nThe answer to this, in its simplest forms, will probably not be much comfort, but it's critical for everyone to realize that it's the only truth out there: earning the respect and consideration of the government requires **a lot of hard work.**  There's just no way around it.  The beauty of democracy is that people can influence public policy by non-violent means, but they still have to *fight* for their beliefs just as much as anyone in a dictatorship must in order to be heard.\n\nMany people like to focus on the amount of money that lobbyists for corporate and special interest groups sling around to try to buy influence with politicians.  And while that's part of the story, it's *only* part of it.  Lobbyists also do a *shit ton* of work to get the laws and policies they want.  They talk to politicians, government staffers, other private VIPs, to the media, and to the public, building up friendships and professional relationships to make sure they always have an opportunity to, at the very least, make their case and have it seriously considered.  As a private citizen, a person might complain that he can't approach the scale of campaign donations that interest groups can toss around, but if he's not willing to put forth even the same sort of *effort* as those interest groups' representatives, then the money is just icing on the cake of his failure.\n\nIf you believe in a cause, if you seriously want to make a difference with government policy, then you *cannot* leave it to other people to make the difference for you.  Other people can *help* you, in fact you'll need them to be successful, but you have to take personal responsibility for promoting your own beliefs.  Communicate your beliefs to your representatives so that they actually know what you care about, and never let them forget.  Stay informed about your issues and government actions upon them, when your representatives do something relevant make sure you let them know you're watching.  Talk to *everyone* you know, and your acquaintances to make sure they understand why something is important to you, and why it should be important to them.  Convince them to take the same sorts of actions you are, by communicating with representatives and staying informed.  \n\nA lot of people don't like talking politics, and that's a major obstacle for all of us, but *those people and their apathy are the problem with the system*.  Politicians have been mocking the great uneducated, apathetic masses since time immemorial; treating them as children who don't know what's best for themselves if they even have opinions at all.  Too often we *let them do it*.  If you really want to get anything done, then \"I don't care about politics\" is not an acceptable answer.  It's tough to thread the needle of respecting a person while changing their minds, but the challenge does not make it any less essential: again, politics is hard work.\n\nIf there's an organization dedicated to your cause, join it and support it.  If there's not, or the ones that exist are incompetent, *build one yourself*.  If there are no politicians who actually represent your views the way you want, then run for office yourself, or find someone who you think would do a better job and convince *them* to run.  We such open access to ballots in our system for a reason, take advantage of it.\n\nWe hear exhortations like \"get organized!\" and \"make your voice heard!\" so often that they can seem like simple platitudes.  But we're sabotaging our political influence when we forget the underlying truths of those statements.  Organization and communication aren't just *one* way to stand up, they're pretty much the *only* way.  If you're not dedicated to your cause, you'll be outlasted by people who are.  If you don't take action in support of your cause, no one will even know you believed in anything in the first place.\n\nIt's possible, even if you do everything I've described, that you can still fail.  Sometimes a message doesn't resonate with enough people, or the other side simply does it *better*.  But if you put in that effort and fail, then you at least can't be blamed for lack of trying.  I see to many public causes that fizzle simply because the supporters can't be bothered to *do* anything.

And give the finger to anyone who complains that you ruined the election for someone else; if they wanted your vote, they should have earned it from you.\n\nOkay, as to your first question: **How do we stand up for ourselves?**\n\nThe answer to this, in its simplest forms, will probably not be much comfort, but it's critical for everyone to realize that it's the only truth out there: earning the respect and consideration of the government requires **a lot of hard work.**  There's just no way around it.  The beauty of democracy is that people can influence public policy by non-violent means, but they still have to *fight* for their beliefs just as much as anyone in a dictatorship must in order to be heard.\n\nMany people like to focus on the amount of money that lobbyists for corporate and special interest groups sling around to try to buy influence with politicians.  And while that's part of the story, it's *only* part of it.  Lobbyists also do a *shit ton* of work to get the laws and policies they want.  They talk to politicians, government staffers, other private VIPs, to the media, and to the public, building up friendships and professional relationships to make sure they always have an opportunity to, at the very least, make their case and have it seriously considered.  As a private citizen, a person might complain that he can't approach the scale of campaign donations that interest groups can toss around, but if he's not willing to put forth even the same sort of *effort* as those interest groups' representatives, then the money is just icing on the cake of his failure.\n\nIf you believe in a cause, if you seriously want to make a difference with government policy, then you *cannot* leave it to other people to make the difference for you.  Other people can *help* you, in fact you'll need them to be successful, but you have to take personal responsibility for promoting your own beliefs.  Communicate your beliefs to your representatives so that they actually know what you care about, and never let them forget.  Stay informed about your issues and government actions upon them, when your representatives do something relevant make sure you let them know you're watching.  Talk to *everyone* you know, and your acquaintances to make sure they understand why something is important to you, and why it should be important to them.  Convince them to take the same sorts of actions you are, by communicating with representatives and staying informed.  \n\nA lot of people don't like talking politics, and that's a major obstacle for all of us, but *those people and their apathy are the problem with the system*.  Politicians have been mocking the great uneducated, apathetic masses since time immemorial; treating them as children who don't know what's best for themselves if they even have opinions at all.  Too often we *let them do it*.  If you really want to get anything done, then \"I don't care about politics\" is not an acceptable answer.  It's tough to thread the needle of respecting a person while changing their minds, but the challenge does not make it any less essential: again, politics is hard work.\n\nIf there's an organization dedicated to your cause, join it and support it.  If there's not, or the ones that exist are incompetent, *build one yourself*.  If there are no politicians who actually represent your views the way you want, then run for office yourself, or find someone who you think would do a better job and convince *them* to run.  We such open access to ballots in our system for a reason, take advantage of it.\n\nWe hear exhortations like \"get organized!\" and \"make your voice heard!\" so often that they can seem like simple platitudes.  But we're sabotaging our political influence when we forget the underlying truths of those statements.  Organization and communication aren't just *one* way to stand up, they're pretty much the *only* way.  If you're not dedicated to your cause, you'll be outlasted by people who are.  If you don't take action in support of your cause, no one will even know you believed in anything in the first place.\n\nIt's possible, even if you do everything I've described, that you can still fail.  Sometimes a message doesn't resonate with enough people, or the other side simply does it *better*.  But if you put in that effort and fail, then you at least can't be blamed for lack of trying.  I see to many public causes that fizzle simply because the supporters can't be bothered to *do* anything.  Politics is hard work, but if you have enough respect for yourself and your beliefs, you won't let that stop you from doing it anyway.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "techz7", "id": "t1_c9ndyqw", "parent_id": "t1_c9ndcop", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431415794, "controversiality": 0, "body": "You are right, me myself I don't know enough about the political sphere and I do need to educate myself which is partially what I was attempting here.

But its done this way to keep costs down for women who really *do* need the coverage for the two or three times its actually needed.  But even after menopause, when they realistically no longer need it, they *still* pay for that coverage.\n\nThe biggest reason health insurance costs as much as it does has more to do with what it covers than anything else.  All insurance is basically risk-based pricing: take condition A, estimate the cost of treatment times the cost of an individual acquiring that condition.  Then do the same with Condition B, C, D... etc.  That's how you roughly calculate the cost of the premium.

But I think you're missing some important factors in the cost of healthcare: hospital profit and insurance investor profit. Hospitals charge insane amounts of money for cheap things like toilet paper, tylenol, and very crappy food (think of it like the $1000 toilet seat story from the military). Of course like any business, they have overhead. But I don't see the justification that clearly. And insurance investor profit, in my opinion, works like any other for-profit corporation in that they maximize profit to keep investors happy.

The reason that employers get a better deal is that they get group-rates which spread the risk/cost around.\n\nIf we were to offer cafeteria plans, where people choose whether they want just basic catastrophic care (essentially current-day HDHP/HSAs) and then \"buy\" packages that extend coverage, you would see prices drop.  Right now, the insurance I have covers me if I ever get pregnant.  If that happens, I won't need insurance as I'd be the first male pregnancy.  But its done this way to keep costs down for women who really *do* need the coverage for the two or three times its actually needed.  But even after menopause, when they realistically no longer need it, they *still* pay for that coverage.\n\nThe biggest reason health insurance costs as much as it does has more to do with what it covers than anything else.  All insurance is basically risk-based pricing: take condition A, estimate the cost of treatment times the cost of an individual acquiring that condition.  Then do the same with Condition B, C, D... etc.  That's how you roughly calculate the cost of the premium.

But I think you're missing some important factors in the cost of healthcare: hospital profit and insurance investor profit. Hospitals charge insane amounts of money for cheap things like toilet paper, tylenol, and very crappy food (think of it like the $1000 toilet seat story from the military). Of course like any business, they have overhead. But I don't see the justification that clearly. And insurance investor profit, in my opinion, works like any other for-profit corporation in that they maximize profit to keep investors happy. I don't know for certain, but my impression is that the formula to assess risk is a distraction. I think the prices are literally \"jacked up\" to the extreme disadvantage of most Americans.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I have limited familiarity with al-Qaeda itself, but I might be able to offer some insight into the larger context of historical events during its formation.\n\nOkay, so bin Laden got his start as a credible jihadi during the fight against the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in the 1980s.  That war itself has a lot of interesting context going back to the great power politics of the 19th century, but it's only marginally related to al-Qaeda.  Basically, it's a Cold War proxy fight pitting a Soviet-aligned government along and the USSR itself against a really weird coalition of anti-Soviet factions, including the US but led mostly by Pakistan in this particular case.  Bin Laden led a (relatively) small group of foreign fighters to help the Afghan mujahideen.  The consensus seems to be that he probably did not make much of an impact, just because his forces were so insignificant compared to the scale of the whole thing.  And contrary to a lot of popular assumptions, the CIA and Pakistani intelligence probably didn't have much or anything to do with him; he had his own finances and contact network and the CIA and ISI had better prospects with their own Afghan friends.  But regardless of the ultimate weight of bin Laden's contribution in Afghanistan, his assistance there certainly bolstered his reputation and gave him confidence and credibility as a serious fighter for his movement, especially among Arabs.\n\nThe Soviets left Afghanistan in 1989, which is seen as the end of the war by most outsiders (for a lot of Afghans, it's still going today), so bin Laden went back to Saudi Arabia.  By this time, he'd apparently been giving a lot of thought and working on building an organization to pursue a much broader agenda of militant jihad.  Well, the first opportunity to demonstrate that capability came very shortly after his return home, when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 and started the Gulf War.\n\nYou probably have a better feel for bin Laden's ideology and religious motivations than I do, but I imagine that he saw Iraq in a similar light to the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan.  It was a Soviet client espousing a secular and socialist ideology.  Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, was bin Laden's home and a conservative religious monarchy to which I'm sure he felt much more sympathetic.  So when bin Laden offered to help the House of Saud repel the Iraqis, I imagine that he genuinely thought that this could be his next major campaign in the war to promote his beliefs.\n\nUnfortunately from his perspective, the Saudis were much more cynical students of geopolitics.  Saudi Arabia was a long-time US client during the Cold War, and they called in their favors with Washington.  The US sent in a huge army and even managed to get UN approval for the intervention thanks to the hastening end of the USSR and its ambitions as a superpower.  Apparently the invitation of an American army to Saudi territory *greatly* offended bin Laden, for reasons to which I am not at all sympathetic and you, again, may be better equipped to grasp.\n\nAnyway, that seems to be the moment at which bin Laden wrote off Saudi Arabia as an enemy.  I'm pretty sure he already put the United States in that camp, too, despite the previous convergence of interests in Afghanistan.  But the Gulf War may have made him feel even more bitter towards the US than he had been and possibly put more priority on attacking them.\n\nSo in 1992 the Saudis banished bin Laden for being a pain-in-the-neck dissident, and he winds up in Sudan.  I'm sketchy on Sudanese history, but this wasn't long after al-Bashir took over the country, and he was apparently committed to a fundamentalist Islamic policy (or at least allied with a political faction of that nature).  He may well have seen offering refuge to bin Laden as a way to boost his own rep with the militant islamist crowd.  Anyway, bin Laden went to Sudan and took the opportunity to build some more overt infrastructure for his network with training camps.  Of course his covert organization probably continued to grow as well.\n\nSudan didn't last very long, though.  More and more Western and allied governments were starting to discover plots or suffer attacks by terrorists that could be linked to bin Laden or at least to people who closely shared his beliefs and circle of friends.  One of al-Qaeda's strengths was that it was never a very centralized terrorist organization.  At best it was a cellular network, or else just a loose affiliation of like-minded people who shared some contacts and some resources but actually planned and executed operations independently.\n\nAnyway, bin Laden quickly became more of a liability than an asset to Sudan.  They eventually expelled him in 1996, probably at least in part thanks to US pressure.  But also because bin Laden was likely becoming anxious to leave himself as various foreign governments became increasingly eager to kill him.  Saudi Arabia still hated his guts (and actually revoked his citizenship and cut off funds from his family in 1994), so he went back to Afghanistan.\n\nAfghanistan, at that point, was *mostly* in the hands of the Taliban.  Whether that meant it was more or less of a mess than during the period immediately beforehand really depends on whether you're more bothered by horrible repression or horrible chaos.  Anyway, the Taliban were generally sympathetic to bin Laden's ideology, didn't care about what the rest of the world said about them, and were physically isolated from most threats anyway; so it was a fairly ideal place for bin Laden to relocate.\n\nFrom that point on, bin Laden and company *might* have begun receiving genuine assistance from the ISI (inter-services intelligence, Pakistan's military intelligence and possibly evil shadowy overlords, basically what conspiracy nuts think the CIA is).  That's still controversial and not entirely clear; personally I lean towards it being true, but not as significant a detail as many might think.  That Pakistani military has long had a peculiar interest in Afghanistan and a desire to control the place out of paranoia and a probably misguided belief that it could be useful in the event of war with India.  As a result, they've long sought to buy off whatever Afghan factions were most pliable and sympathetic to their own ideologies.  Bin Laden's group probably seemed like it could be another useful contact and proxy inside Afghanistan, so they likely developed some kind of relationship.\n\nFrom there, bin Laden continued to provide what support he could to terrorists and fighters that aligned with his cause.  Mostly terrorist bombings, but apparently he also helped train fighters for the Taliban's local military.  And that behavior continued right up through (and after) the quite spectacular attack now known as 9/11 which made neutralizing him and his affiliates priority #1 for the American government and resulted in the toppling of the Taliban government.\n\nAll right, hope that provides some insight at least into how bin Laden's timeline fit into the stuff going on around him.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_19un0p", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Hmm.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_19qsre", "selftext": "If it matters, I am an American.\n\nAnd I'd certainly say y'all ought to have a Presidential system rather than a Monarchy.  Hereditary nobility just isn't cool.\n\nAs for a separately-elected executive rather than a parliamentary government... I'd say it depends on what you want.  Personally, I think the much more important element of the American system of government compared to the Commonwealth nations is our written, difficult-to-alter constitution, rather than its specific details.  From what I understand, you folks are closer to having one of those than the UK, but I highly recommend adopting a single, supreme document as the basis for your government, whatever form it takes.\n\nAs for the presidency itself, well, it does make it easier to have a predictable, continually-functional government regardless of shifting political alliances or chaotic elections in the parliament.  That definitely spares the rest of the world a lot of headaches when you're a keystone of global institutions the way the United States is; consider the drama that could erupt if our allies (or their enemies) were no longer certain whether our government was capable of responding to guarantee the terms of our security treaties (e.g. if China invaded the Senkaku islands, would the US government have legal authority to provide military assistance to Japan?).  Financial obligations can be placed in similar jeopardy, but don't rise to quite the same level of drama, even if they can be just as critical for peace and harmony on Earth.\n\nOn the other hand, Canada *isn't* as critical to the rest of the world as the US (sorry, you get to be cool in other ways), so the switch wouldn't really provide all that much relief to anyone outside your borders.  But if you don't like the damage that power vacuums and governments with shaky legitimacy or caretaker status can do to domestic concerns, then a separately-empowered executive might be just the reform you're looking for.\n\nOne risk, though, is concentrating *too* much power in the hands of a single entity.  It can be tempting to invest a lot of power in a single entity like a President simply because of how much it simplifies the decision-making process for important issues even in periods of crisis.  The problem is, if you make your legislature powerless, then it becomes something of a pointless institution.  Generally people *want* an empowered government body made up of a multitude of individuals each representing much smaller opinions and interests than can be embodied in a single person.  Representative bodies help create public debate over issues, which helps the public *understand* those issues and feel involved in their resolution.  And when people feel involved and consulted in their government, they're less likely to resent it and/or seek to undermine it.\n\nUnfortunately, at the other end of that pendulum lies the problem of giving your legislature so much power that your executive becomes pointless.  We love to cite the concept of \"checks and balances\" in the US, but one little-talked about consequence of that system is that sometimes the checks are so effective that government can grind to a halt.  If you give your executive the obligation to implement policies, but the legislature sole authority to pay for them... then you run the risk of creating deadlock if those two branches hate each other and either the executive doesn't want to do the stuff the legislature is paying for, or the legislature doesn't want to give the executive the resources to do its job.  The effective result can be limbos similar to situations where no party in parliament has a governing majority and no party can agree to govern in coalition... only parliamentary systems at least have options of new elections or the possibility of new coalitions to form governments.  In the US, disparate factions remain in place until we reach the next fixed-date election, and shifting alliances in our congress still can't replace the President's government.\n\nPersonally, I think the biggest advantage to the American-style Presidency over Canada's government is that our leader is a truly national representative.  Since Canada's run by a parliament whose seats are elected in geographic districts, it's conceivable that Canada can be governed by a party which never even appeared on a citizen's ballot.  In the US, we all at least get the opportunity to vote for or against the guy who'll be leading us all (though actually this isn't technically guaranteed, but it's been true for a long time and is much more certain than in Canada).  Of course, that's more a function of having a geographically districted parliament; you could also resolve that matter by switching to a proportionally-representative one based on a national election.\n\nUltimately, I think my recommendation is to say: go for it!  But if you prefer not to, it's not a great tragedy for your country.

A dollar bill is basically an IOU redeemable from *anyone* for $1 worth of goods or services.\n\nHere's an (*extremely*) simplified scenario illustrating money creation:\n\n* Initial situation: Nobody has any money.\n\n* The Central Bank creates $10.\n\n* New situation(1): The Central Bank has $10 cash, for a total money supply of $10.\n\n* The Central Bank loans $10 to a branch bank at 10% interest.\n\n* New situation(2): The Central Bank has $11 of assets and the branch bank has $10 of cash.  The money supply is still $10, though total assets are $21.\n\n* The branch bank lends $9 to a businessman at 11.11% interest (trying to keep the math simple).\n\n* New situation(3): The Central Bank has $11 of assets, the branch bank has $1 of cash and $10 of assets, and the businessman has $9 of cash.  Total assets are up to $30, money supply is still $10.\n\n* The businessman pays a laborer $8 to do some work.\n\n* The laborer deposits the $8 in his savings account at the branch bank.\n\n* New situation(4): The Central Bank has $11 of assets, the branch bank has $9 cash and $10 assets, the businessman has $1 in cash (presumably he'd also have some assets from the work he paid for, but I'm ignoring that for simplicity's sake), and the laborer has $8 in cash.  Total assets are up to $39, *and the money supply has increased to $18.*\n\nSee what happened?  The $8 savings deposit is considered money in the hands of *two* entities in this economy: the depositor and the bank storing it.  This the point at which banking seems to function a bit like alchemy (and bankers like mad scientists).  The process is not intuitive, and seems at first like it should cause everything to collapse around our ears (I was horrified when I first had this explained to me in my first economics class).  *But it works.*  This is the underlying financial structure of the modern economy, and it's had roughly the same form for a few centuries now.\n\nBest part is what happens next.\n\n* The branch bank lends a second businessman $7 (and for the sake of simplicity we'll say this is a 0% interest loan, the second businessman is the brother of the bank owner or something).\n\n* Businessman #2 pays laborer #2 the whole $7 to do some work.\n\n* Laborer #2 deposits his $7 of earnings in his account back at the branch bank.\n\n* New situation(5): The Central Bank has $11 of assets, the branch bank has $9 cash and $17 assets, businessman #1 has $1 in cash, laborer #1 has $8 in cash, and laborer #2 has $7 cash.  The money supply has increased to $25.\n\nKeep in mind that this is, again, an *extreme* simplification of the reality.  The actual economy is much, with many hundreds of banks and myriad other actors involved in this process, and the money they spend and create is constantly changing hands.  The speed and complexity of that circulation is what keeps the whole thing together: if everyone was able to suddenly demand that all their debts be paid *right now* and simultaneously cashed out their bank deposits, everyone would go bankrupt.\n\nAnyway, hope that helps, rather than just causing confusion.", "id": "t1_c88d7p6", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Lorpius_Prime", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c88e1f3", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Yep.

The reason that banks are able to survive (and prosper) as businesses is because such situations almost *never* come up; people usually only need access to a small fraction of their total wealth at any given moment.

Affording the income supplements to push everyone above that level would not be a significant problem if there was a global effort, even at current tax rates.  A bigger problem would be simply identifying the individuals in need of aid and distributing it to them.  That's hard when so many live in difficult-to-reach areas without transportation infrastructure or access to financial institutions, or even in more accessible areas but without reliable identification.\n\nConsider, however, that what we call \"poverty\" in actually developed countries is a different matter entirely; even people earning tens of thousands of dollars a year can fall below the United States' official domestic poverty line, depending on the size of their family.  Eliminating *that* kind of relatively-determined poverty is a much more difficult proposition in terms of funding.\n\nAs far as the actual taxation of the rich goes, the problem is not warped income incentives turning rich people into moochers as some have mentioned in the answers.  Yes, income taxes are a disincentive for earning higher incomes, but the effect is not really *that* dramatic until you start getting up to confiscatory tax rates around 90% of income.  High earners appear not to be easily deterred from their earnings.\n\nThe bigger trouble is collection.  The rich have a significantly easier time avoiding (and evading) taxes than do people with less income.  Most dramatically, the highly globalized world means they can choose to renounce the authority of a collecting government by seeking citizenship in a friendlier territory.  France has recently been having public spats over this as they try to introduce much higher taxes on the extremely wealthy.\n\nBut emigration is probably a small worry compared to other means of avoidance or evasion.  The rich can more easily afford skilled tax accountants and lawyers to legally limit their liability or illegally hide incomes and assets so that they do not pay.  Complicated tax laws allow the rich to take advantage of loopholes.  Most frustratingly, discrimination among types of incomes (such as labor income versus interest payments) may be taxed at different rates, so that the primary sources of income for the very wealthy are not as liable as the primary income sources for lower earners.\n\nEffectively collecting much larger sums from the very wealthy requires significant reform of tax codes, and probably greater international cooperation and harmonization of tax regimes in order to limit the advantages of cross-border tax schemes.  Localized tax reform may be possible, but will likely always be difficult simply because of the greater political clout wielded by the wealthy.
