I'd also note that Obama is much more involved in direct foreign policy decisions than Nixon was. Nixon had priorities but staffed them out to Kissinger much of the time, while Obama plays a bigger role in policy. \n\nMy top answer is Samantha Power. Her influence on this administration has been surprisingly large. But there isn't a Kissinger today. Many thought that Richard Holbrooke would have been, but he didn't seem to get along with the Administration very well and he died early on. History doesn't have direct parallels most of the time. \n\nI'd also suggest that US policy toward Cuba isn't necessarily getting softer in the long term. Carter lifted the ban on Americans traveling to Cuba, and Reagan brought it back. Clinton eased the ban by making it easier for students to travel, and Bush brought it back. Obama made it easier again, but the next GOP president (or another Dem) could change it again. Cubans have a lot of power in Congress, so I wouldn't expect this to change until both Castros die.

Only voting, and fear of voters throwing them out, can be a sufficient motivator to prevent that. But don't assume that voters would side with the House just because the health care law is disliked; once Social Security checks stop going out, people would get pretty ornery about the government being shut down.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "**Apportionment:** Changing the allocation of representatives so that each state doesn't get at least one would require a constitutional amendment (as would making DC a state, for that matter). It's not likely to ever happen this way. However, there's an easier solution to get rid of malapportionment: double or quadruple the number of representatives. Congress froze the growth of the House by statute in the early 20th century, and they can unfreeze it. If the House were twice as large, then Wyoming would still get one representative and Montana would get two. The more that you increase the size of the House, the more equal representation will become.\n\n**DC Voting Rights**: I'm a big advocate for DC representation in Congress and local autonomy, but you should note that DC *does* have representation in the House. Congresswoman Norton doesn't have a vote in the full House, but she can vote in Committee and introduce legislation. Of course, I'd like to see DC represented with a full vote in the House and two votes in the Senate, but making DC a state would also require a constitutional amendment. Because the 23rd Amendment gives the seat of the federal government three votes in the Electoral College, making a State of Columbia wouldn't remove those Electoral Votes, effectively leaving the federal lands (White House, namely) with three EVs. That would have to be repealed before DC could become a state. \n\n**Gerrymandering**: There's a easier solutions than what you're describing. First, states could set up nonpartisan redistricting commissions, like California has, to draw districts by taking the power away from the legislature. Second, you could just have statewide elections without districts. This was a traditionally accepted form for elections in US History. Say that California gets 53 congressmen. Rather than electing them one-person-per-district, it could just be a general statewide election. Because you're choosing 53 people from one giant district, this means that other parties could get past the threshold that they couldn't reach in a per-district election. The majority would still be Democrats, and a quarter would probably still be Republicans, but libertarian and green candidates would be viable enough to get 5-10% and win seats. \n\nOf course, a general statewide district opens up major problems with the Voting Rights Act requirement of majority-minority districts, but that will be moot soon since the Supreme Court looks likely to strike down Voting Rights Act.

Even ceding everything but federal land to Maryland would give the 23rd Amendment problem again. \n\nI'm not certain that it's such a problem to have a larger House. It's not like the House is super governable now. I think more democracy is a better solution than less, and that was originally intended to be a constitutional principle too. The first amendment proposed in the Bill of Rights said that there should be one representative per 30,000 people. It wasn't ratified by enough states, but it could still become the 28th amendment if states continued to ratify (like the 27th Amendment). There's plenty of theory about why the House would be ungovernable, but I don't see any examples where too many legislators is a bad thing. New Hampshire has an extremely representative legislature and its citizens are pretty happy with it, while California's State Senate is actually less representative than its congressional delegation and its residents are pretty unhappy with it. \n\nAnd right, I'm not saying that DC has equal footing with other members of Congress.

This has historically meant that parties aren't unified; Democrats in the South were more conservative than Republicans in the northeast, but they didn't switch parties because of their liberal or conservative ideology because of complicated historical legacies from each party. This has only really changed recently, as *every* Republican is more conservative than *every* Democrat. How recently? 2009 was the first Congress since the Civil War era where the parties were perfectly ideologically divided like that. \n\nSo, no offense, but I think your premises might be a bit simplistic.

Remember, he came to power only a few years after Vietnam; he was entirely opposed to getting into another quagmire like that. Reagan wasn't the swashbuckler he is remembered as. Of course, he was okay with helping to inflict the USSR with its own Vietnam experience in Afghanistan, sold weapons to Iran illegally, and inflated the military budget to unprecedented levels -- but in terms of actual military operations, it pales against Iraq. \n\nNot to mention, Reagan (and the 1980s GOP) never really tried to end Medicare or Social Security (though Reagan famously opposed Medicare from the start); they didn't try to expand the social safety net, and Reagan demonized welfare recipients, but it was more talk than action. Compare that to Bush's attempt to privatize Social Security, and the Paul Ryan budget's plan to make Medicare a defined-contribution plan rather than a defined-benefit plan. \n\nIn terms of being in cahoots with the religious right, Reagan started a trend, but he definitely didn't see its peak. Reagan's administration cracked down on tax-exempt status for religious organizations in the [*Bob Jones*](http://www.oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1982/1982_81_3) case (decided by Rehnquist, no less!), holding that they cannot racially discriminate in admissions and keep the subsidy. At the same time, the [*Regan*](http://www.oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1982/1982_81_2338/) case held that tax-exempt status is a form of public subsidy, and finding that tax-exemption is incompatible with \"substantial lobbying\". \n\nCompare that to Bush II, who established the office of Faith Based Initiatives.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_18jgsg", "selftext": "While I'm not a Reagan supporter by any means, I have to clarify some of your points. \n\nYes, Reagan refused to talk about AIDS until late into his presidency, but it's not like there was much to say. No one knew what caused the spread of AIDS until the late-1980s, toward the end of his second term. Even in the last years of his presidency, it was not scientifically established that the disease was spread through sexual transmission. Reagan, it should be remembered, was a creature of Hollywood: he knew that it wasn't smart to discuss the issue supportingly, but he came from a culture where it was part of the landscape. He was close friends with Rock Hudson, and was one of the few people who knew of Hudson's homosexuality; it was Hudson's death from AIDS that caused Reagan to finally address the issue publicly. [Reagan's interior decorator in the White House was gay, and Reagan had him and his male partner/lover sleep over at the White House for Nancy's 60th.](http://igfculturewatch.com/2004/06/10/reagan-and-gays-a-reassessment/) Most importantly, as the 1978 California Briggs Initiative sought to ban gay teachers from the classroom, Reagan publicly opposed the initiative, stating that homosexuality is determined at early childhood if not before (even while he sought the White House, knowing it was a nationally unpopular position). \n\nDid Reagan pledge to end *Roe v. Wade*? Yes. But as Governor of California, he signed at least one bill allowing more permissive abortion laws. He never pushed legislation about abortion as President. Most tellingly, when choosing a Justice who he knew would be the determinative vote on overturning *Roe*, he selected O'Connor -- even knowing that she had backed pro-choice legislation as an Arizona legislator, and writing in his diary that she might not vote to end *Roe*. \n\nAs for the GOP \"doing what is has always done since Nixon's time\", I think you should look at Nixon's accomplishments as President. He opened trade with China, not exactly a conservative goal. He stridently backed the Clean Air Act, the creation of the EPA and OSHA, and his health care plan was arguably more liberal than Obama's (it included a stringent employer mandate, as well a setting prices for treatments and pharmaceuticals). He endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment.

Since the 1990s, Republican leaders in Congress have refused to bring a bill to the floor unless it can pass with a majority of Republican votes (this is known as the \"Hastert Rule\"). This was never violated from its inception until this year; so far, the Fiscal Cliff and Hurricane Sandy relief have been allowed to come to a vote despite the lack of a majority GOP support. These bills passed due to a coalition of Democratic and moderate Republican support. \n\nIf you look at the breakdown of the Fiscal Cliff vote, it gets very interesting: [Republicans from the more liberal Northeast and West backed it by a wide margin; midwestern Republicans were split; and Southern Republicans voted against it 81-12.](http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2013/01/21/130121taco_talk_packer) It's possible that this could be the dawn of a House controlled by the center-right, rather than the far-right, as the more conservative southern congressmen get increasingly sidelined. \n\nIn addition to the Southern/non-southern split in the GOP, [two other potential crack-ups are happening that could break apart a united Republican front.](http://politicalwire.com/archives/2013/02/14/two_splits_within_the_republican_party.html):\n\nThe first is establishment/anti-establishment. The Tea Party movement certainly helped the GOP take back the House, but it prevented it from retaking the Senate. If the establishment-backed candidates had won their primaries in Delaware and Nevada (2010), or Indiana/Missouri (2012), Republicans would have four more seats in the Senate (and maybe five, since Olympia Snowe probably retired due to increasing radicalism in the party, giving away the seat). The establishment is pushing back against these fringe candidates, and that might change the 2016 landscape enough to increase moderate GOP power.\n\nThe second is Washington/not-Washington. Republicans have more high-profile moderate governors (Christie comes to mind) than they do Senators or Representatives, and many of them represent the potential diversity of the GOP (Bobby Jindal in Louisiana, Brian Sandoval in Nevada, and Susana Martinez in New Mexico). These governors probably represent the best hope of a moderate GOP in the future (as well as having the best electoral chances). If Christie is elected President, don't be surprised if you see social issues (which make the GOP increasingly unpopular with young voters) take a backseat. The problem is that the Republican presidential primaries make it very difficult to be the GOP nominee without taking unpopular stances (think of Romney's immigration positions in the primaries versus the general election).
