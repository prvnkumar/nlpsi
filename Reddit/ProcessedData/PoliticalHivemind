I think this example better exposes the hypocrisy on the right, and shows the \"small goverment\" hype to be the sham it really is. \n\nA few years ago we had a health care debate, and a program called the \"Public Option\" became a major part of that debate. \n\nThe public option was the idea that a government program (remember, those lazy, inefficient things) would be created, and that it would have to run itself like a private entity. It would have to pay its own bills, and act as a health insurance company. If people wanted to buy insurance, they could choose to go with the public option. \n\nIf the right really believed the \"lazy and inefficient\" myth, they would have laughed at this prospect. They would have found it hilarious that silly Liberals would want to pit the lean mean private insurance industry against a lazy, inefficient, government run program. It should not have been a sticking point. It would have been a spectacular example of the failure of government for the right, and it would have propped up the belief that the government needs to be shrunk, that its a waste of money etc... if the right actually believed any of that.\n\nInstead what happened was you all shit your pants. The right was terrified of the prospect of this \"lazy and inefficient\" government program stepping into the private marketplace, because frankly, you all knew that it was going to wipe the floor with the insurance industry. The right said as much when it started calling Obama care a \"government takeover of health care\". \n\nSo despite the nonpartisan CBO's claims that the public option would save a huge amount of money, you all opted to only move forward with Obamacare once the threat of a government run competitor in the private marketplace was soundly removed. \n\nI love this example of right wing hypocracy. It was a beautiful thing. I watched as the pundits went from railing about the inefficiency and waste of government, to talking about how the private insurance industry needed saving from government based competition and back.

The IRS and other departments do not allocate a portion of their costs to Social Security and Medicare as they would if it were a private company that must adhere to GAAP.  Medicare and Social Security and any other program that gets the benefit of other's collections has no cost associated with that.  Yes, those are the governmental rules, but its also one of the few places where the government told the accounting profession to bug off - they have the power.\n\n&gt;The fact that congress is not funding them, or that (in social security's case) the surpluses created by those programs were squandered by Republican administrations such that the programs are now considered to be in the red is irrelevant when we're calculating the efficiency of the programs, and these ARE highly efficient programs.\n\nFirst, it wasn't only Republican administrations - every Congress has gotten Social Security to buy Treasuries with its surpluses.  Technically, they are still there, which is why they are not entirely out of funds yet.  Social Security has been a known problem for... well, since 1988 when it was last revised would be a good starting point.  And its not like projections of it going bankrupt didn't start after that.  Medicare as well.  There aren't enough people paying into the system - that's demographics.\n\n&gt;they did it with the post office by forcing them to pay forward their retirement programs.\n\nAh, I love when this comes up, because it is *pure politics*.  What the USPS is being forced to do would be what in the business world would be called \"best practices\".  The USPS, over the course of the next few years, is required to fund their pension and retiree health promises at 100% their actuarial projections (now, in terms of the accounting, its much more complicated, which is where the 75-year quote comes from).    Right now its pretty close to that, which means workers will most likely get what they were promised.  CalPERS, on the other hand, is roughly [60-70% funded (page 5)](http://www.calpers.ca.gov/eip-docs/about/facts/general.pdf).  However, it might actually be worse than that as pension funds get to estimate what their rates of return are.  They 7% for their anticipated returns.

Nevermind no one would work at that rate, but that's static scoring.  Its a known limitation, but politicians don't like to talk about it.  There is a decent reason - its impossible to come up with a single dynamic projection, mostly because its extremely difficult to know all the variables.

In addition, if it did not, looking at the finances of these Programs, B and C will look to be more profitable than they really are and Program A will look less profitable then it is - after all, its bearing the collection costs of three Programs (granted, its only incremental most likely, but there are still costs there).

Most economists would agree that they can't do nearly as much as the media likes us to believe. That said, it's a lot easier to fuck up the economy than it is to improve it, as the large majority of economic policy is undeniably good.\n\nRegardless of this, personally, I'd say (speculate) that we can judge the president's economic impact best once his policies are implemented in their entirety (and policies are repealed accordingly). Considering Obama's first term was diddled away by the Republican House, I'd certainly say he can't be blamed or appreciated that much for what we see today, but the effects of the Auto industry bailout/stimulus package which he supported were definitely far reaching, as well as some other decisions (ending wars, medicare, etc) so there is some basis to judge on.\n\nThe problem is that we certainly will never see an approval of all of Obama's economic decisions anytime in his presidency, so we're left with approved policies, but the most impactful ones are often ignored. Additionally, the political world loves to ignore the House and Senate, as well as local legislatures, because it's much simpler to pin it on one person.

"subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Paul Ryan's bills were a joke when it comes to saving anything.  The basic problem is that Medical entitlements are unsustainable at their present levels of growth.  Ryan's plan punted on addressing that cost in the near term for the simple fact that either party perceived as cutting Medicare will lose seats in the next election because old people vote.  So his proposal did nothing to cut costs in the short term and only sold out post-Boomer generations to the private market in the hope that would contain costs.  Easy for him to sell out his generation since he gets the Cadillac plan that congressmen get.\n\nI watch the current debate and think the GOP has either lost its mind or more likely has no desire to stop the gravy train of federal spending.  They ask Obama to ask for entitlement cuts for them so that they can then blame Democrats for cutting entitlements in the next election.  Of course we know that is their only option because Democrats would use any plan the GOP puts out against them in the next election.\n\nSo if you want to see this problem fixed, stop voting for panderers that blather on about principals and focus on electing people that are willing to lose an election to do the right thing.
