So in [Gerrymandered](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0CvmK0dVcI) districts the politicians are only concerned with giving the core of their party what they want, and since the constituents get their entire X-mas list every year they keep getting more demanding.\n\nBecause of this there are a large number of members of the house and Senate that would lose their jobs next election if they don't look like they are giving the more extreme end of the party what they want. On the other hand a large number of republican don't run in these districts so they need to have a more moderate stance to keep their jobs. Because of this consideration in their politics the extremist side of the party calls them RINOs or Republicans In Name Only (not to be confused with the Rino party of canada).\n\n\nThere is more to it, but the core issue is that in some districts the extremist republicans can punish any politician who dares to be moderate, but in others the tone set by the first bunch is endangering their careers.

If none of that gets the desired reaction, US, Japanese, or South Korean citizens will be \"arrested\" (held hostage) by the North Korean government until their country of origin makes concessions (think [this event](http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/08/04/us-korea-north-idUSSP47880420090804) from 2009).\n\nThat is all assuming North Korea actually *wants* something and its actions aren't simply a form of protest against the ongoing annual military exercise ([Foal Eagle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foal_Eagle)) conducted by the US and South Korea (which will end later this month) or a means of creating instability to allow North Korea's ruling party to further consolidate its power.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bqwcx", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c99kogp", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1365231177", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPDidntDeliver", "id": "t1_c99ws41", "parent_id": "t3_1bqwcx", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431649072, "controversiality": 0, "body": "1. I think that people with power in the government are trying to overthrow Kim Jong Un. Ever since he became North Korea's leader, conditions have gotten worse and almost no progress with weapons has been made. As such, people may want to overthrow him, and he is trying to keep his power by appearing strong to the people. If the world continues to call North Korea's bluff, I think he may be overthrown.\n\n2. My dad suggested this idea: In response to the South Korean and American military exercises, the DPRK may be organizing military exercises of their own. IIRC, the majority of North Koreans live somewhat near the border, so if the people they've been taught to hate are practicing for a possible war, something bad could happen. Also, ships at sea and jets flying overhead could cause mass panic. As such, North Korea may be \"preparing for war\" to calm their people and train their military at the same time. If the world continued ignoring them, this rhetoric would probably lessen or stop in a month or two.\n\n3. This is the least likely idea I've brought up. North Korea, Iran, China, and/or Russia may be preparing to attack the U.S. and its allies. Iran and North Korea have ties, and the Chinese government doesn't like the U.S. because we are against their corruption. However, China needs the U.S. to keep the economy stable. Russia is an ally (at least somewhat) of both Iran and China and possible North Korea. North Korea may attack the U.S., South Korea, or Japan, and the U.S. would attack them as a response with whichever country was attacked. China and/or Russia may intervene, getting the U.S. more involved as well as the U.N. If Russia attacked Europe or Canada *or* if the U.S. needed help, Western Europe might attack. Meanwhile, Iran could attack Israel. If this happens (which I hope and pray it won't but it's incredibly unlikely), Israel could take on Iran, South Korea and Japan could take on North Korea, Europe could take on Russia, and the U.S. could take on China and be partially involved in all other fronts. Again, I think this is extremely unlikely, but it's still a small possibility.\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bqwcx", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c99ws41", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1365288232", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "clicked": false, "title": "what do you think North Korea is going to do in the coming weeks and months if the rest of the world continues to call their bluff?", "media": null, "base10id": 80196945, "id": "t3_1bqwcx", "score": 20, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 4, "saved": false, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1bqwcx/what_do_you_think_north_korea_is_going_to_do_in/", "name": "t3_1bqwcx", "created": 1365188120, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1bqwcx/what_do_you_think_north_korea_is_going_to_do_in/", "author_flair_text": null, "author": "roastbeeftacohat", "created_utc": 1365184520, "distinguished": null, "num_comments": 18, "num_reports": null, "ups": 24}
