So you could argue that Saudi Arabia and Iran are duking it out for influence/control in Syria. Another step back and the US are behind Saudi Arabia and Russia are behind Iran/Syria. The Russians only warm water port is in Syria so in that sense they have direct interest in the outcome. At the UN Security council Russia has opposed (via threat of veto) any moves that could sway the outcome (i.e. a no fly zone.)  Russia do not want a repeat of Libya where they thought they were OK-ing a no-fly-zone but that morphed into basically close air support for the anti-Qaddafi forces. That said, Russia sees that the writing is on the wall for Assad but have not quite abandoned him yet. The main stumbling block to some sort of peace agreement is that Russia insists that Assad retain power whereas the US insists he has to go.\n\nSo, Iran supports Hezbollah via Syria and thus Iran can attack Israel at arms length. Whether Hezbollah were getting a large arms cache (because the source will imminently dry up once Assad falls) or were getting access to new weapons (anti-aircraft missiles) we do not know.\n\nThe US has no appetite for intervention in Syria beyond possibly a no-fly zone.

They're not a country with much oil, they don't control fundamental trade lanes, and their influence on the rest of the region is of little substantial impact. The most classically attractive interest for us would be to undermine an ally of Iran. But there's the rub - an unstable neighbor producing on ongoing security threat probably forwards our interests (with respect to destabilizing Iran) to a much greater degree than a direct intervention.\n\n\nWith this in mind, there are still potential exercises of US influence that are under current debate. The main question is about arming the Syrian opposition - which is very attractive to many in Washington. However, taking a longer look at the history of the region (and of the world), one thing that remains true is that even if regimes change, once you put guns out into the world, they don't come back. And there's not much way to control who they go to next. So providing arms might actually encourage destabilizing groups that ARE in areas of our interest. The most recent example is of militants spilling out of Libya and into Mali and other areas of North Africa. \n\nSo, as depressing as it might be, there's just not much advantage in us intervening. As OP points out, the US war fatigue issue is also very real -- so I wouldn't expect much movement in Syria any time soon unless we start to see evidence of more substantial (read: WMDs) crimes against humanity.

This means that there is no positivist definition of threat that emerges just from the existence of certain developments, e. g. the Islamist forces in Mali taking control of the northern part of the country. Threats are, instead, identified as such inter-subjectively. They are viewed as threatening certain referent objects because people agree on them being threatened - why they agree is not necessarily important. The referent object that is referred to here could be anything - France's national identity, the economy, environment, anything.\n\nNow, what this would tell us in the situation of France in Mali is this: the success of the rebels in Mali, a country of the Francophonie and ally of France, has been identified as a threat by the French government and public. The referent object might be vague ideas of French influence in Africa, political, cultural, economic ties, Western ideals and values, etc. So-called securitizing actors have thusly securitized the issue of rebels in Mali as threats to any of the above-mentioned concepts and the French public has accepted the securitizing attempt. The result would be that the intervention is removed from political discourse - precisely because it is agreed upon as an existential threat to something the French government and public value. [This](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/01/17/sacred_union_france_mali_military_intervention) article describes a French phenomenon in conjunction with the recent intervention that might support this point of view. \n\nYou might have noticed that an assessment among any kind of criteria whether or not France herself is threatened by Malian Islamists and/or rebels does not have a place in the Copenhagen School. It marked the emergence of the so-called \"linguistic turn\" because of the nature of the securitization as a speech act.\n\nJust a last note to this: it is very easy to slip from the Copenhagen School into some obscure conspiracy theory because of the securitizing actor basically trying to convince an audience - the public - of a threat to a referent object that might, under different analytical frameworks, not be viewed as actually threatening. This can then easily lead to the assumption that more sinister motives are the drivers behind such a securitization attempt. This was never the intention of the \"fathers\" of the Copenhagen School, and the basic concepts do not require any other motivations than that the securitizing actors do in fact believe something to be a threat. There is no reason to assume that the French government acted because of other reasons than the ones already discussed elsewhere in the thread.\n\nI hope all of this makes sense to you and helps you give a different albeit just as interesting perspective on security in general and France's current affairs in Mali in particular. The Copenhagen School concludes that potentially a full intervention of France in Mali is actually the best way to counter the threat of the Malian rebels precisely because of the frameworks established in the securitization, not necessarily because of positivist assessments of threat analysis. \n\nSource: [Security - A New Framework for Analysis | Barry Buzan, Ole W\u00e6ver, Jaap de Wilde](http://www.amazon.com/Security-Framework-Analysis-Barry-Buzan/dp/1555877842)", "edited": 1359563779, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_17ijr3", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c86a2e3", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1359560297", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c85waax", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431126031, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8632nf", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1359521248", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

The referent object that is referred to here could be anything - France's national identity, the economy, environment, anything.\n\nNow, what this would tell us in the situation of France in Mali is this: the success of the rebels in Mali, a country of the Francophonie and ally of France, has been identified as a threat by the French government and public. The referent object might be vague ideas of French influence in Africa, political, cultural, economic ties, Western ideals and values, etc. So-called securitizing actors have thusly securitized the issue of rebels in Mali as threats to any of the above-mentioned concepts and the French public has accepted the securitizing attempt. The result would be that the intervention is removed from political discourse - precisely because it is agreed upon as an existential threat to something the French government and public value. [This](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/01/17/sacred_union_france_mali_military_intervention) article describes a French phenomenon in conjunction with the recent intervention that might support this point of view. \n\nYou might have noticed that an assessment among any kind of criteria whether or not France herself is threatened by Malian Islamists and/or rebels does not have a place in the Copenhagen School. It marked the emergence of the so-called \"linguistic turn\" because of the nature of the securitization as a speech act.\n\nJust a last note to this: it is very easy to slip from the Copenhagen School into some obscure conspiracy theory because of the securitizing actor basically trying to convince an audience - the public - of a threat to a referent object that might, under different analytical frameworks, not be viewed as actually threatening. This can then easily lead to the assumption that more sinister motives are the drivers behind such a securitization attempt. This was never the intention of the \"fathers\" of the Copenhagen School, and the basic concepts do not require any other motivations than that the securitizing actors do in fact believe something to be a threat. There is no reason to assume that the French government acted because of other reasons than the ones already discussed elsewhere in the thread.\n\nI hope all of this makes sense to you and helps you give a different albeit just as interesting perspective on security in general and France's current affairs in Mali in particular. The Copenhagen School concludes that potentially a full intervention of France in Mali is actually the best way to counter the threat of the Malian rebels precisely because of the frameworks established in the securitization, not necessarily because of positivist assessments of threat analysis. \n\nSource: [Security - A New Framework for Analysis | Barry Buzan, Ole W\u00e6ver, Jaap de Wilde](http://www.amazon.com/Security-Framework-Analysis-Barry-Buzan/dp/1555877842)", "edited": 1359563779, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_17ijr3", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c86a2e3", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1359560297", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c85waax", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431126031, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8632nf", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1359521248", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c85vsec", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431122781, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Even if one would arrive at the conclusion that an Islamist Mali would be a threat to the Western world, however a definition of \"threat\" or \"Western world\" might look, it would not automatically necessitate an intervention like the one France is conducting at the moment.

This means that there is no positivist definition of threat that emerges just from the existence of certain developments, e. g. the Islamist forces in Mali taking control of the northern part of the country. Threats are, instead, identified as such inter-subjectively. They are viewed as threatening certain referent objects because people agree on them being threatened - why they agree is not necessarily important. The referent object that is referred to here could be anything - France's national identity, the economy, environment, anything.\n\nNow, what this would tell us in the situation of France in Mali is this: the success of the rebels in Mali, a country of the Francophonie and ally of France, has been identified as a threat by the French government and public. The referent object might be vague ideas of French influence in Africa, political, cultural, economic ties, Western ideals and values, etc. So-called securitizing actors have thusly securitized the issue of rebels in Mali as threats to any of the above-mentioned concepts and the French public has accepted the securitizing attempt. The result would be that the intervention is removed from political discourse - precisely because it is agreed upon as an existential threat to something the French government and public value. [This](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/01/17/sacred_union_france_mali_military_intervention) article describes a French phenomenon in conjunction with the recent intervention that might support this point of view. \n\nYou might have noticed that an assessment among any kind of criteria whether or not France herself is threatened by Malian Islamists and/or rebels does not have a place in the Copenhagen School. It marked the emergence of the so-called \"linguistic turn\" because of the nature of the securitization as a speech act.\n\nJust a last note to this: it is very easy to slip from the Copenhagen School into some obscure conspiracy theory because of the securitizing actor basically trying to convince an audience - the public - of a threat to a referent object that might, under different analytical frameworks, not be viewed as actually threatening. This can then easily lead to the assumption that more sinister motives are the drivers behind such a securitization attempt. This was never the intention of the \"fathers\" of the Copenhagen School, and the basic concepts do not require any other motivations than that the securitizing actors do in fact believe something to be a threat. There is no reason to assume that the French government acted because of other reasons than the ones already discussed elsewhere in the thread.\n\nI hope all of this makes sense to you and helps you give a different albeit just as interesting perspective on security in general and France's current affairs in Mali in particular. The Copenhagen School concludes that potentially a full intervention of France in Mali is actually the best way to counter the threat of the Malian rebels precisely because of the frameworks established in the securitization, not necessarily because of positivist assessments of threat analysis. \n\nSource: [Security - A New Framework for Analysis | Barry Buzan, Ole W\u00e6ver, Jaap de Wilde](http://www.amazon.com/Security-Framework-Analysis-Barry-Buzan/dp/1555877842)", "edited": 1359563779, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_17ijr3", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c86a2e3", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1359560297", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c85waax", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431126031, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8632nf", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1359521248", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c85vsec", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431122781, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Even if one would arrive at the conclusion that an Islamist Mali would be a threat to the Western world, however a definition of \"threat\" or \"Western world\" might look, it would not automatically necessitate an intervention like the one France is conducting at the moment.

The African country is a member of the Francophonie, an organisation through which France keeps 'in contact' with French-speaking countries all around the world.\n\n&gt; Third, the French government was simply asked by the Malians to assist, probably because of the aforementioned ties between the two countries.\n\n&gt; Fourth, while France does not have a direct interest in Mali's natural resources, it does get its uranium from mines in neighbouring Niger. In the desert in these countries, state control is minor, therefore the highly mobile rebels also threaten adjacent countries and their stability. This should not be overstated and as far as I know, France has never made an official comment about the importance of those mines. It should not be identified as the 'sole reason' for France's intervention. It just might offer additional incentives.\n\n&gt; Fifth, and this is the most vague point in my post as I am no expert on France's political identity, it might be that France stills sees herself as a powerful military state that is capable and supposed to 'sort things out' in the world. I don't like the accusation that 'they never got over the loss of their empire', what I'm saying is just that certain perceptions of decision-makers about their country and role in the world might persuade them to act in certain ways - this time by trying to swiftly defeat the rebels, stabilize Mali and contribute to the security of Africa and, by extension, Europe.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_17ijr3", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c85vjq6", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1359497788", "ups": 12, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Just wondering but would another reason for this invasion would be to prevent radical groups from gaining a voice in the UN?", "id": "t1_c8636ce", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Jamiefool", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c868gug", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "yotox", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c8636ce", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1431128658, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Not really.
