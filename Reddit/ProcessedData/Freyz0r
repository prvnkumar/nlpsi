The world as a whole is much more diverse and complex, as there are very different historical, cultural, and legal influences across the world.  Which would be chosen in such a system?  Who would decide that?  What would the other nations do if they disagree?  In addition, for instance, look at US interests if a world government was formed.  If voting power was equal among countries, a small nation would have as much voting power as the US.  If voting power was based on population, India and China would have huge influence disproportionate to other factors.  If GDP was used for voting, then countries would artificially boost their GDP in ways that damage the world economy and produce inefficiencies overall.  If military power was used for voting, it would just create an arms race.  Overall, the world is very diverse and would not work well cohesively in a world government framework.

They are usually well funded by industry and usually staffed by experts in the field.  They each have an agenda, and their job is to convince Congress to follow that agenda.  They also have the expertise to explain how to actually implement that agenda.  Some of the controversy is that they may be too effective at their jobs, and that the less well funded lobby groups are not as persuasive as the better funded lobby groups, even if the population proportionately does not agree with the better funded lobby group's position.\n2. Very minor role in modern politics.  Sometimes they draw voters away from one of the two big parties, and that can slightly influence the election one way or the other.  The purpose of these third parties is to make a big enough impression that the threat of losing votes to this third party from either of the two big parties forces them to alter their position on an issue to get those votes.\n3. This is complicated, but very generally Democrats traditionally value bigger government via more social services, paid for by higher taxes.  They are also bigger on personal liberties.  Republicans traditionally are more for a smaller government with less social services, lowering the tax rate.  Instead, they prefer these services and other duties be privatized.  They are also bigger on religious Christian social values and traditionally on a greater military budget.  Currently though, modern politics is blurring these distinctions a bit.\n4. First, usually a first term president wins his second term unless he makes some big mistakes.  So, historically, Obama had that going for him.  Also, Romney had big ideas, but he never explained them more than superficially.  For instance, he made some big promises about a new tax code, but he never specified any details.  On other other hand, Obama had 4 years of details that he could point to during his presidency, and was more open about his future goals.  He also made some other mistakes during the campaign like betting another candidate $10k during a debate during an economic depression.  That alienated some voters.  He also changed his positions too often during the campaign, which made some voters question his real views if he were to take office.  Some think that this is because the Republican party is fracturing between Tea Party side and the Traditional Republican side, so he had to appease both sides that had opposing views on issues.  As a result, he would make statements one day in front of a Tea Party audience and then a week later make an opposite statement in front of a Traditional Conservative audience.", "id": "t1_ca9j5lt", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Freyz0r", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1fcn7n", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430972100, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1fcn7n", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ca9j5lt", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1370015606", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

The US system is an example of a poorly handled health market, most notable for its overwhelming inefficiency (18% of gdp for lesser outcomes.) Most of this waste happens because most of the normal market functions of competition on price or quality aren't happening, so prices naturally inflate. Certain companies, especially big pharma, charge obscenely high prices for their products, and then simply make excuses for it. Prices are high in the US because they need R&amp;D money, and therefore the US is subsidizing innovation for the rest of the world, they say. But they could be bullshitting about this, and probably are. They put a ton of work into evergreening patents, very anti competitive. They don't even spend that much on R&amp;D as far as I can tell. But a lot of that information is hidden. So they can lie, and their interest is to lie. \n\nNot to mention the AMA, a very effective trade group masquerading as a health organization. A group that helps to keep the quantity of docs and other practitioners artificially low, and argues against the existence of an obvious shortage, in order to keep their wages high. What would the docs' interest be, from an economic perspective, anyway? Lots of chronic disease, and very expensive care. Not that I'm accusing docs of keep pts sick, that's not the case.

That is a [bad assumption.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo)\n\n\n\n&gt; The Republic is not in any danger from National Popular Vote\n\nI would argue that it *would* be, because all of the shit that happened with recounts, lawsuits, etc, in FL2000, WA2004, MN2008, and was just *waiting* to happen in every swing state this past presidential election, would be likely to happen in *every* state in *every* election, because a few hundred/thousand votes here and there could change the entire national results, even if those votes were in solidly blue or red states.\n\nWhat's worse, it would *significantly* make things harder on any sort of upstart candidate/party.  Let's say that one or the other major political party pulled shenanigans (like they did on different topics this past election) and the candidate who was *the* most preferred candidate is set aside by the political party in favor of the \"designated winner\" (that Mr Romney so obviously was this year), and decides to run anyway.  Or let's say we have another Ross Perot.   If every vote counted directly to who won the presidency, then *no one* would truly be free to vote their conscience *ever again.*  Oh, sure, *occasionally* you *might* have someone whose conscience aligned with one or the other major party candidate, but the fact is that anyone and everyone who voted for someone else because they honestly believed that they would be a better president would be *directly blamed* for the 2nd place candidate losing.  \n\nYou want to talk about entitlements?  This is the biggest entitlement out there: the fact that the Republican and Democratic parties believe, have absolute faith that your votes *belong to them.*  A national popular election would make this even more true (in practice) than it already is, which is an affront to everything that makes democracy a good idea.\n\nAnd you're also directly ignoring the fact that \n\n&gt; The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government[.]\n\nIt could be argued that by going to a National Popular Vote without a constitutional amendment would deny many of those states a truly republican government.  For example, look at UT, WY, and ID,  which voted for Romney at 72.8%, 68.6%, and  64.5%, respectively.  If they were members of the NPVIC, their government would *not* be representing their will in any meaningful way.\n\nLikewise, look at the 2004 results for DC (89.2%), MA (61.9%), and VT (58.9%), all three of which are members of the NPVIC.  Their clear preference for Mr Kerry would not be reflected in their elector votes, and thus it would not be a (state level) republican government.\n\nA better compromise would be a Proportional Allocation of Electors, under that, it would *only* take their own state into account, but would still make the will of the people more direct.  For example, in 2012 FL was 50.01%D/49.13%R/0.86%O and North Carolina was 48.35%D/50.39%R/1.26O.  Instead of having an elector split of 29/0/0 and 0/15/0, you would have something more like 15/14/0 and 7/8/0, respectively.  In general this would not change the outcomes of elections, but it *would* likely result in them much more closely matching the popular vote, without there even being a *question* as to whether or not it undermines a \"Republican Form of Government.\"", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; The proportional method also could result in third party candidates winning electoral votes that would deny either major party candidate the necessary majority vote of electors and throw the process into Congress to decide.\n\n\nYes and no.

If, at some time in the future, the public demands run-offs, that change can be implemented at that time. \n\nAnd, FYI, with the current system, it could only take winning a plurality of the popular vote in the 11 most populous states, containing 56% of the population of the United States, for a candidate to win the Presidency with a mere 23% of the nation's votes.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8uhsdx", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1363128445", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1a3ehf", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; National Popular Vote would limit the benefits to be gained by fraud or voter suppression.

All you need is a thin and contested margin in a single state with enough electoral votes to make a difference. It's much less likely that the national vote will be close enough that voting irregularities in a single area will swing enough net votes to make a difference. If we'd had National Popular Vote in 2000, a recount in Florida would not have been an issue.\n\nThe idea that recounts will be likely and messy with National Popular Vote is distracting. \n\nThe 2000 presidential election was an artificial crisis created because of Bush's lead of 537 popular votes in Florida. Gore's nationwide lead was 537,179 popular votes (1,000 times larger). Given the miniscule number of votes that are changed by a typical statewide recount (averaging only 274 votes); no one would have requested a recount or disputed the results in 2000 if the national popular vote had controlled the outcome. Indeed, no one (except perhaps almanac writers and trivia buffs) would have cared that one of the candidates happened to have a 537-vote margin in Florida. \n\nRecounts are far more likely in the current system of state-by-state winner-take-all methods.\n\t\nThe possibility of recounts should not even be a consideration in debating the merits of a national popular vote. No one has ever suggested that the possibility of a recount constitutes a valid reason why state governors or U.S. Senators, for example, should not be elected by a popular vote. \n\t\nThe question of recounts comes to mind in connection with presidential elections only because the current system so frequently creates artificial crises and unnecessary disputes. \n\t\nWe do and would vote state by state. Each state manages its own election and is prepared to conduct a recount. \n\nThe state-by-state winner-take-all system is not a firewall, but instead causes unnecessary fires.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an arsonist itching to burn down the whole neighborhood by torching a single house.\u201d Hertzberg\n\t\nGiven that there is a recount only once in about 160 statewide elections, and given there is a presidential election once every four years, one would expect a recount about once in 640 years with the National Popular Vote. The actual probability of a close national election would be even less than that because recounts are less likely with larger pools of votes. \n\nThe average change in the margin of victory as a result of a statewide recount was a mere 296 votes in a 10-year study of 2,884 elections. \n\nNo recount would have been warranted in any of the nation\u2019s 57 previous presidential elections if the outcome had been based on the nationwide count. \n\t\t\nThe common nationwide date for meeting of the Electoral College has been set by federal law as the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December.  With both the current system and the National Popular Vote, all counting, recounting, and judicial proceedings must be conducted so as to reach a \"final determination\" prior to the meeting of the Electoral College.  In particular, the U.S. Supreme Court has made it clear that the states are expected to make their \"final determination\" six days before the Electoral College meets.\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8uhu1c", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1363128575", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1a3ehf", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1a3ehf", "selftext": "Please point out to me exactly where I endorsed the current set up?

Palestinians and Jews were living there, but more Palestinians than Jews.  After WW2, a movement called Zionism became popular.  This was a movement to create a Jewish state in what is now Israel.  This gained popular support after the Holocaust, where 6 million Jews (1/3 of the entire world population of Jews at the time) were killed by Nazis.  Britain couldn't decide who should control Israel, the Palestinians or Jews.  So, they asked the UN to decide.  The UN voted on the issue and gave a small strip of what is now Israel to Jews to form a new country.  The day after its formation, it was attacked on every side by its Muslim neighbors.  Its Muslim neighbors asked the Palestinians to leave the area so that they could better defeat Israel.  Nevertheless, Israel won the war and expanded its borders to encompass the land it gained during the war.  So, many Palestinians were displaced.  They tried to immigrate to other Muslim nations, but most were denied.  In 1967, surrounding Middle Eastern nations again began massing troops at the border of Israel and prepared to strike.  Israel launched a pre-emptive attack and defeated all the attacking nations.  Israel gained the Sinai Peninsula, the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank in this war.  \n\nThey traded the Sinai Peninsula back to Egypt in exchange for a lasting peace.  The Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank, all at the time were populated mostly by Palestinians.  However, Israel won the territory in war.  They treated these areas as occupied territories and part of Israel.  Some Palestinians retaliated with violence and resorted to terrorism.  Others tried to use peaceful means to gain independence.  Currently, Gaza Strip has focused on violence and terrorism.  They're being blockaded by Israel to limit the flow of weapons in order to protect the Israeli population.  The Palestinians instead argue that they are also limiting other supplies like concrete.  While true, Israel's argument is that they are rationing supplies so that it isn't used to build bunkers, etc.  Palestinians still get a lot of materials and weapons secretly through tunnels through Egypt.  Every so often, Israel launches strikes to destroy these weapons, but it inevitably also causes some collateral damage that angers the Palestinians even more.  However, the Palestinians launch missiles at Israeli citizens almost constantly.  But, they're usually very simple, homemade missiles.  they also have a few more sophisticated missiles that can hit more distant Israeli cities.  Gaza Strip want independence.  Israel is afraid that, if they gave the Gaza Strip independence, weapons would flow more freely and they would be under further threat.\n\nThe West Bank is largely using more peaceful means.  However, success has been limited on both sides.  The party in control of the Palestinians in the West Bank is largely considered ineffective and weak.  At the same time, Israel has been building settlements into West Bank territories, making the Palestinians in the area nervous.  The West Bank wants independence.  They recently got UN observer status, so they are getting closer to that goal.  However, the issue is what territory to give them.  As I said, Israel has built settlements in the West Bank.  People are living there.  Israel wants those areas to remain part of Israel.  The Palestinians are not pleased with that idea.  There are also plenty of areas that are evenly controlled by Palestinians and Israelis.  Which group gets to control those areas?  They also want part of East Jerusalem under their control, which Israel does not want to give up.  Also, since they are in different places, they'd have to give the West Bank control of part of a road connecting the two, creating potential security problems.\n\nIn summary, it's a complicated problem that will take a lot of continued work to solve peacefully and to both parties' satisfaction.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "jo9008", "id": "t1_c8tkvla", "parent_id": "t1_c8thd30", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431549416, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thank you, this was very helpful.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_19xk7y", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8tkvla", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1363006091", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Freyz0r", "id": "t1_c8thd30", "parent_id": "t3_19xk7y", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1431547685, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1363058696, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8thd30", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1362980409", "distinguished": null, "ups": 3}
