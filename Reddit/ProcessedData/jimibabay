To wit, the choices the US makes in the region will also influence the kind of postures and actions Japan will take. The US has shifted towards a Pacific focus, including establishing new bases in the Pacific and showing an willingness to push back against China-- most recently there was the whole air defense zone thing. A strong US presence in eastern Asia might give Japanese policy makers the room to increase military/support resources, or it might give them the opportunity to be an intermediary/other 3rd party role between the US and China and depend on US military protection.\n\nB) The same considerations should be had for Korean-Chinese relations. A super belligerent N. Korea may end up shifting the way that China applies power in the region, and may create a backdrop against which Japan might arm itself further outside of the context of Sino-Japanese relations. But, those armaments obviously have an impact on how Japan and China interact.\n\nC) Another factor to consider is whether traditional sources of tension, e.g. WW2, might fade as the older generation dies off/leaves power.\n\nD) Strong economic growth in both countries might shift the focus away from competitive relations. Changes in either country's economic make-up (e.g. an aging Japan and an increasingly urbanized, middle-class China) will shift the way that trade and politics interact. Of course, that's not to say that clashes in economic markets (e.g. increasingly sophisticated Chinese technological products) might not produce things like tariffs or other competitive actions.

Madison was no fan of democracy. [\"Hence it is that such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths\"](http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa10.htm). That's why we have a bicameral legislature, separation of powers, a formerly indirectly elected Senate, etc.\n\n2. Faction was a concern of Madison's, but his solution was not only dispersion but the separation and conflict of powers. [\"Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.\"](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers/No._51).

For example, how often have you seen the most absurd Facebook copy-pasta on your feed? Further, if we compare the populations of [social media users](http://blog.bufferapp.com/social-media-in-2013-user-demographics-for-twitter-facebook-pinterest-and-instagram) (where most users are 25 y/o women) and [voting turnouts](http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_12.html) (where most voters are older than that) we have a very imperfect comparison between groups-- that is, the people most likely to see social media are not the ones most likely to vote. \n\n4. \"[O]nly people with abrasive and incendiary language are paid attention to and distract the rest of us,\" seems similarly overblown. Again, reference the statistics above. Further, it's very difficult to make broad generalizations like this. If, for example, we value privacy rights above all else then the validity of the \"incendiary\" statement that Obama is literally Big Brother has more to do with personal preference than some harm to democracy.

Technically you'd be trespassing or hunting without a license, etc. but if you're smart about it no one's going to find you. For example, there's over [84 million acres](http://www.nps.gov/faqs.htm) of national parks with only about 22k employees, where the number of rangers is undoubtedly smaller. That's a lot of acres for forest rangers to cover, and if you build a house up in some remote valley and hide it from the air, then I don't see why you couldn't live completely off the grid.\n\nThere's probably also less extreme methods. Tear up your passport and IDs and then become a vagrant. You might be able to lead a vaguely comfortable cash-only existence as a dishwasher or something.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Like /u/Xing pointed out this is really risky, if not terrible, politics. Maybe you don't want to reach that level of analysis though.\n\nPolicy-wise your ideas, while nice sounding, lack the depth right now to be viable. \n\n1) You champion drug legalization to increase revenue and strengthen public programs (you highlight education and public parks), and repurpose police officers.\n\nRevenue: It is not just as simple as abolishing criminal penalties for possession and use of drugs. Taxes don't automatically flow in. Instead, you must mandate that drug use and production be taxed. The problem, of course, is taxing a market that is designed to be beyond public scrutiny. You have to develop a MASSIVE regulatory structure to implement those taxes. For example, Colorado recently did that with marijuana. This is one of at least 3 major bills passed this last session, and more are assuredly to come: [1] (http://www.leg.state.co.us/clics/clics2013a/csl.nsf/fsbillcont/31D153749B49700187257B2F00580E15?Open&amp;file=1318_enr.pdf). \n\nBut that's small potatoes. The real problem is always the details. What should the tax rate be for drugs? Should marijuana be taxed at the same rate as alcohol? Higher? Lower? Should we discriminate between drugs with higher social and medical consequences, e.g. heroin and methamphetamine? Every step of the way you will also confront the very serious problem that if make the taxes too high then producers and consumers will just continue to use the lower priced market. Or, if taxes are too low you'll have a situation where the costs of drug use are not \"adequately\" covered by tax revenue. \n\nWhy should we legalize all drugs? We might have reasons to believe marijuana isn't harmful, but can we say the same thing about heroin or meth? \n\nCops:\n\n1) Your repurposing argument strikes me as silly. Police have a very specific set of skills. Teachers have a very different set of skills. Indeed, the two are so different that there's a huge gape in education and licensing qualifications to do either job. Simply because they have a desire to \"work with/for\" society does not make them equivalent. There's a reason they are police teachers and not teachers, even if it's simply desire. Further, the MASSIVE re-education costs of training police-teachers will be enormous. \n\n2) But the larger problem is that cops will not disappear. Someone will need to enforce the regulatory structure. There's a reason the IRS is so huge. In a world where a black market structure already exists, there is very little incentive for users to switch to a legal and more costly alternative. Without a stick to disincentive the use of the black market there is no need for the legal one. Instead, you'll just see legal establishments distributing product without paying the taxes on it, and therefore turning a higher profit.", "id": "t1_cdfow65", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "jimibabay", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1qr0jd", "score": 6, "retrieved_on": 1428636738, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1qr0jd", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdfow65", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384616198", "ups": 6, "distinguished": null}

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I'm going to take a contrarian position in regards to domestic level issues. It's not necessarily something I agree with, but it's an argument that I think has legs. It's formulation is by no means perfect or universal, but I think it's a fairly reasonable argument.\n\n1) Ethics and morality largely inconsequential until they intersect with society. That is, we can speculate and argue all we want in a vacuum, and it's fun, and potentially useful to us as people. But, by the definition of this argument, it has very little impact on the lives of real people. In the crudest form: the lives of billions of people are not affected because you read Socrates and decide that Platonic forms are the correct way of thinking about epistemology.\n\n2) The intersection of society and ethics is called the law. Since this is America I'm going to restrict myself to talking about American lawmaking processes. The basis of our system is consent. The social contract conceit explains that government exists to safeguard certain rights in exchange for freedoms guaranteed to us by the \"state of nature.\" In order to best maximize our freedoms and safety, we trust a system of government defined by our Constitution. Broadly, it filters popular and \"reasoned\" opinions into law. This law both mirrors and norms our social values. Therefore, what is legal is good, by force of definition and appeal to the value of our society. So, if you believe that you lead a more comfortable life than not, and that your comfortable life is predicated on the society that you live in, then you value the society we live in.\n\n3) Seeking to preserve that society, we should value, foremost, what is legal and what is not. While we can express distaste or pleasure for certain things not codified or specified by law, generally we should try to constrain ourselves within the boundaries of law if we wish to preserve our society. \n\n4) Applying that framework to Snowden exposes that much of what the NSA does is, within the confines of how our legal system understands itself, legal. The Patriot Act, FISA, etc. all authorize (or at least fail to condemn) the collections that the NSA has conducted. The creation of the FISC, the procedures in the Patriot Act, and the general defense that for the purposes of a search, collected data analyzed by machine is not a search within the meaning of our Constitution, all provide significant legal room for the NSA to operate legally. \n\n5) Hence, the NSA's actions are largely legal. Snowden's actions are, almost without question, illegal. His violation of the law is, under this framework, an unqualified wrong. The disrespect (ie the lack of consent) to the normative and structural power of the law is very dangerous to its power and continuation. Thus it is dangerous to the society that we believe is predicated on that rule of law. \n\n6) One obvious counter-argument makes an appeal to the rule of law as well, though per the terms of this framework it is an illegitimate appeal. The rule of law means what the law says-- not what someone feels privacy or due process, etc. should mean. This includes appeals to alternate theories of legal rationales and defenses for Snowden's actions. In our legal system such arguments are persuasive only if raised in a setting approved by law, i.e. at trial or in the law making process, etc. Otherwise, they are, returning to 1) simply ethical arguments without importance. \n\nA similar argument might be made that Snowden's actions are an appeal to a lawful authority: the will of the people and the democratic process. Such a theory seems appealing, but is inconsistent as it is predicated on an act of disobedience to the law. But, a counter-reply is available. This is where you enter a more disputed area as there is some historical evidence (eg the Civil Rights Era) to suggest that civil disobedience may be part of our lawmaking process. However, civil disobedience historically entailed submission to the punishment of the law. So again, Snowden has failed to act legally, even under this alternative theory. \n\nThat's at least what I've got off the top of my head.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1o33k5", "selftext": "Broadly, consider the fact that most of what the NSA does is classified. This includes many of the orders and warrants that they issue to subjects of their surveillance and investigation. In some cases it's illegal to even acknowledge the fact that the NSA or others are watching you. So there's an intentional gap built into the system that makes it largely unaccountable to the populace at large.\n\nConsider two other things. First, if the NSA really wants to spend its time watching you, and it becomes a problem for you personally then two things are likely to be true. 1) You're doing something you seriously shouldn't be doing. We're not talking about buying drugs or downloading movies, or many of the other illegal things that people do. 2) Rather than exposing the specific channels that the NSA can monitor you on, they pass along you as a person of interest to, say, the FBI. Then they can watch you, gather their own evidence of you doing illegal things, and then bust you for it. This means that you're likely a very unsympathetic example of misconduct, and that we'll never know how the FBI got tipped off. \n\nBut, that's not necessarily the whole story. There are other things happening that people might call harms. On a political or philosophical level you may feel violated by the mere fact of intrusion into your life. Many people are uncomfortable with such violation, but many people will also disagree with whether that rises to the level of abuse, misconduct, or harm. Beyond that, some people-- for example Lavabit and its team-- face very tough economic choices and ultimately suffer some economic consequences. Then consider that the NSA is most likely using its intelligence to, in the best case, track terrorists across the globe and, perhaps, feed the CIA or the military the information they need to kill or rendition them. Maybe those people aren't US citizens, and maybe they deserve it, but that's a harm to someone. And that might even bring blowback against US citizens. Finally, consider that maybe there are people out there who are sympathetic to global terrorist aims. They like to go on message boards and watch videos by terrorist leaders. Maybe they talk to the wrong person and get swept up in mass of arrests. Maybe they didn't do anything wrong, but they still go down for it.\n\nThere are lots of analogous examples we can find in the news and history that make these scenarios more than just possible, but the hard evidence is also difficult to find for the next several decades, at least.\n\nEDIT: After doing a little more research there is also this: [1] (http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-08-15/world/41431831_1_washington-post-national-security-agency-documents). This would seem to indicate that some mistakes, possibly rising to the level of misconduct as defined by the NSA or its auditing authorities, have been made. The article isn't super clear on what kind of mistakes were made. If I've been keeping up correctly then most of the programs we know about are largely automated. That is, a human being rarely sees your information. Instead, the computer will parse and use your meta data to make hops through personal communications. Whether or not that worked as intended in these cases-- and whether it now works, or will continue to work, as intended is an open question.

I would think the 15th and 19th amendments speak to the first two qualities, but maybe you'd like to push back. Finally, I point you generally and specifically to here: [1] (http://www.history.org/Foundation/journal/spring07/elections.cfm). Money quote: \"Property requirements were widespread. Some colonies required a voter to own a certain amount of land or land of a specified value. Others required personal property of a certain value, or payment of a certain amount of taxes. Examples from 1763 show the variety of these requirements. Delaware expected voters to own fifty acres of land or property worth \u00a340. Rhode Island set the limit at land valued at \u00a340 or worth an annual rent of \u00a32. Connecticut required land worth an annual rent of \u00a32 or livestock worth \u00a340...Property restrictions gradually disappeared in the nineteenth century. Tax-paying requirements replaced property ownership, though they too waned after the 1820s. By the 1850s, most economic barriers to voting had disappeared.\" This is of course mostly ignoring poll taxes, which don't speak to the proposition, but are certainly closely related. See also: [2](http://www1.cuny.edu/portal_ur/content/voting_cal/milestones.html).\n\nYou might be hinting at Jefferson, and the tension that existed between the Federalists and the Anti-federalists. Even if you are, they are by no means counter to the full proposition that it is better that white male property owners be the only ones to vote. For a fascinating account you can see [3] (http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/documents/1786-1800/the-anti-federalist-papers/qualifications-of-suffrage-%28august-7-10%29.php) for what appears to be general minutes of their debate over just this issue. As best as I can tell, they were less interested in universal suffrage, than in a) whether it was proper to enumerate this in the Constitution and b) avoiding a landed aristocracy. In whatever case, the winning side was the one who left the States to continue their property requirements. Maybe you require an affirmative statement on this issue to convince you otherwise, but for me silence after discussion is often just as telling.

Just because you have a power doesn't mean it's right.  \n\nYou're absolutely right that Nebraska, like most rural states, is a 'taker' state.

We were building a pretty impressive double highway overpass over a river and rail-line in the middle of nowhere; Two overpasses and a horseshoe turn, which cost millions of (mostly federal) dollars.  The town where this overpass was built had 130 people.  \n\nI was having lunch in my safety vest at the local cafe one morning, and one of the locals pointed out how absurd he thought it was that the state was wasting money on such an expensive project when no one in the town even wanted it.  He looked a little taken aback when I told him the overpass wasn't for the people in his town; it was for the trucks driving from Texas to Canada.  The rail crossing was unsafe for the oversized trailers.  \n\nMost of the federal investments in Nebraska follow this pattern.  I-80 exists so that people can drive from Chicago to Denver, not to bolster our economy.

There were 13 different nations forming one.

Wyoming has never lived independently of the United States, and it would suffer greatly if it left.  It only has a greater vote than 'one man, one vote' because of the archaic system.  It, and people like me in Nebraska, which also has more than its fair share of the vote, should give it up because it's the right thing to do, and it will give more legitimacy to the system.  \n\n&gt;there wasn't any discussion of PR (as modern electoral political science understands it) back at the Founding.\n\nNo, there wasn't, because the system is more modern than the founding (about 1840).  I didn't mean to say the founders were idiots for coming up with the system they did; to the contrary, it was very well suited for their time. However, wagons are no longer the best way to get from Philadelphia to New York, and the EC is no longer the best electoral system.  \n\nLike you said, they didn't predict how permanent political parties would become, but they're here to stay.

That means it doesn't serve the purpose of preventing close ties to \"popular passions.\" Rather, it just means the only people whose passions matter are those in Iowa/New Hampshire, and those in the ten or so battleground states.   \n\n&gt;Second, giving over sized power to smaller states was also intentional.\n\nAt the time it was, of course.  There were 13 different nations forming one.  However, much like Greece is no longer a loose coalition of warring city-states, the United States is no longer a disparate group of mini-nations held together to resist European Domination.  Most of the modern states (35, I believe) have never existed as independent nations.  Therefore, most of us don't hold primary allegiance to our states anymore.  I'm an American who lives in Nebraska, not the other way around.  \n\n&gt;why would citizens of Wyoming, say, consent to live in a country where, essentially, the people of NY, CA, TX, and PA get to decide the next President?\n\nThat's a stacked questions, similar to saying \"why would men want women to vote, when that would only dilute their representation\" in 1900.   Wyoming has never lived independently of the United States, and it would suffer greatly if it left.  It only has a greater vote than 'one man, one vote' because of the archaic system.  It, and people like me in Nebraska, which also has more than its fair share of the vote, should give it up because it's the right thing to do, and it will give more legitimacy to the system.  \n\n&gt;there wasn't any discussion of PR (as modern electoral political science understands it) back at the Founding.\n\nNo, there wasn't, because the system is more modern than the founding (about 1840).  I didn't mean to say the founders were idiots for coming up with the system they did; to the contrary, it was very well suited for their time. However, wagons are no longer the best way to get from Philadelphia to New York, and the EC is no longer the best electoral system.  \n\nLike you said, they didn't predict how permanent political parties would become, but they're here to stay.  I don't really think that's a bad thing.  Honestly, I wish our system was more focused on parties and less on individuals.  With the focus being on individuals, discussions on politics often are hard to differentiate from tabloids.

Removing representatives from popular passions means that by diluting the direct will of people via another body of electors, and by forcing representatives like Senators and Presidents to represent huge numbers of people, you make it more difficult for factious people to find power through elected representatives. The problem isn't that representatives know what factious people want, but rather that they know what the 100 different factious people want and it becomes much harder for one voice to win out over another. \n\n2) It's not a stacked question. It's an absolutely crucial one if you're trying to change the Constitution. The only way Constitutional Amendments have been made have been when 3/4ths of state legislatures/conventions agree to an Amendment. There are certainly more than 13 states beyond NY, CA, TX, and PA. Even if you feel you're an American who happens to live in Nebraska, certainly your state legislature has some vested interest in maintaining power. And in turn that power is good for you as a Nebraskan. How many jobs around you are funded by federal money? How many miles of highway are we all paying for in Nebraska? Even if there's no longer a patriotic interest in Nebraska being Nebraska, the outsized power of the state has real impacts on the lives of Nebraskans. \n\n3) I'm not tying you one position or another on the wisdom of the Founders.

Your quote is the argument for representative government.

And in turn that power is good for you as a Nebraskan. How many jobs around you are funded by federal money? How many miles of highway are we all paying for in Nebraska?\n\nWell, yes, there's an interest.  But there was an interest for men to retain sole voting power in the early 1900s, too.  Just because you have a power doesn't mean it's right.  \n\nYou're absolutely right that Nebraska, like most rural states, is a 'taker' state.  But I don't think that's because of our unequally large representation in the EC or the Senate.  \n\nSorry if this is ranty, but quick story: One summer when I was working through undergrad, I got a temp job with the engineering section of the Dept. of Roads.  We were building a pretty impressive double highway overpass over a river and rail-line in the middle of nowhere; Two overpasses and a horseshoe turn, which cost millions of (mostly federal) dollars.  The town where this overpass was built had 130 people.  \n\nI was having lunch in my safety vest at the local cafe one morning, and one of the locals pointed out how absurd he thought it was that the state was wasting money on such an expensive project when no one in the town even wanted it.  He looked a little taken aback when I told him the overpass wasn't for the people in his town; it was for the trucks driving from Texas to Canada.  The rail crossing was unsafe for the oversized trailers.  \n\nMost of the federal investments in Nebraska follow this pattern.  I-80 exists so that people can drive from Chicago to Denver, not to bolster our economy. It happens to have the happy effect of helping our economy, but that's not its primary function.  \n\n&gt; PR is an interesting idea and I think it has a good chance of moving forward.\n\nA guy can dream, right? :p", "id": "t1_cc0vo9k", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Arthur_Edens", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cc0trfc", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429605077, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cc0vo9k", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1378219410", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cc0otov", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1429605969, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cc0trfc", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1378211517", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cc0obu7", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1429608343, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cc0otov", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1378182503", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cc0o54z", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429608599, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1378181181, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1lli3f", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cc0obu7", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1378180848", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cc0nr3a", "score": 7, "retrieved_on": 1429608685, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1lli3f", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cc0o54z", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1378180234", "ups": 7, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cc0kans", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1429608868, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cc0nr3a", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1378179024", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ipz4h", "selftext": "You are correct in the second when you talk about the hearing being done in private.\n\nAs someone else linked to, the court you keep hearing about is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). Congress has the power to set up courts and their jurisdictions via Article 3, Section 1. The FISC was set up by Congress via the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). You'll often hear the terms FISC and FISA used interchangeably.\n\nUnder laws relating to classified information, and to the way that the court is set up, generally, its hearings and rulings are secret. While the popular conception of court is largely a criminal one, there are different sorts of courts. In this case, the FISC court is set up such that its cases proceed *ex parte,* meaning that there is just one side and the judge. So there isn't the sort of adversarial back and forth that tends to define many other US courts. This is, obviously, controversial when people don't trust the government to represent them.\n\nAnother point to expand on is the definition of secret. Secret means that only certain people have access. For example, Senators like Udall and Feinstein have seen many of these rulings and have spoken out before the recent Snowden stuff. Members of the executive also have access to the rulings. I haven't seen this confirmed, but I would also imagine that people like the Supreme Court justices could also view the cases if they wished. And, as Snowden proves, these rulings are available to others within the governmental bureaucracy.\n\nIf I may expand and digress a little bit, I feel like this question is also asking about the rationale for such a system. From my view there are two broad understandings of the question. On one hand there is a strict constitutionalist framework. This is generally people defending the court. To their view, the Constitution is generally more concerned with separation of powers. That is, by pitting parts of the government against each other you avoid bad things. Since these rulings are available to a fair amount of people, and because they tend to affect foreign nationals more than US citizens, the court is working largely as intended. I'd imagine they'd largely point to the history and structure of the Constitution itself. Our system is designed to be representative and separated.\n\nOn the other hand there is a more populist framework. These people, many of whom you'll find here in Reddit, believe it is just as, if not more important, that the government be accountable to democracy, broadly. They would point to the election of officials, and increasing changes to the Constitution to make legislators more accountable to the people, e.g. most strongly the direct election of Senators in the 17th Amendment. Classified information is more problematic in this framework.

You would not necessarily see the result you want. Further, it would seem grossly unfair if people are denied education and access to contraceptives, and then punished for having more children than said limit. To fix this would require a massive political shift that isn't going to happen anytime soon.\n\n2) Even if resources are finite-- which is conceding the issues where you have yet to define a) what resources are finite and b) prove that substitute resources or technological advances will not make them less finite-- your solution does not answer a) whether finite also equates to inadequate, b) whether the solution actually lies with countries like India and China, rather than the US, and c) whether it is child tax credits that are the primary source of our resource deficit in fact, or in correlation as an incentive to have children.\n\n3) Expanding, I think you'd be hard pressed to say that child tax credits are the place to start. At most you're looking at $1,000/child deducted from tax liability. This isn't necessarily income in your pocket because fertility tends to be negatively correlated with income, and therefore the people with the most children tend to be the poorest. If you're the poorest, then odds are you aren't paying taxes anyways because you'll fall below the ~$18,000 needed to qualify for any federal taxes in reality or in terms of liability. Further, and more to a solution, poorer people also tend to be more likely to be on Medicaid and other federal benefits. If we were really interested in a solution you'd have to limit those benefits.\n\n4) Political realities make this all but impossible. Odds are you couldn't get the Left in on this because it is highly regressive, the outcomes would be largely felt by minorities, and it would lead to terrible things like children dying because they were part of a family too large to receive medical coverage/food stamps/welfare. The Left would only ever get on board if it targeted ALL federal benefits. That means if you're a wealthy family with, say, 5 kids, you don't get access to student loans, or tax credits that will actually make a difference for you, etc. But, the Right would probably begin and end the policy as only applying to benefits that largely affect the poor.\n\nSo beyond the theoretical objections, you face some serious problems implementing such a plan.", "id": "t1_cb0n4yb", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "jimibabay", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1i3hdx", "id": "t1_cb0o6uf", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cb0n4yb", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1430501962, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Over course to make something like this happen you would have to get political and offer something more to get more people on board like also guaranteeing some savings to go to strengthening the benefits for families who stay under the three child limit.

I think there's a) less need for a woman to appear fit due, and b) there's a fairly potent defense, regardless of whether it's true, that such a criticism is sexist, esp. if the Republican party continues to have poor message discipline. All Clinton really has to do is release that she has a clean bill of health, and pivot the message to anything else. As the first potential female President anything she lost in that category she would more than make up for in female votes and turnout. How quickly will some idiot spiral the age issue into something about how his wife is getting old, or pivot from age to the menstruation issue, and instantly gain the sympathy of tens of thousands of female voters who hate hearing that kind of thing from their own friends and family? Consider too that in all likelihood if Clinton runs Palin's gonna start making noise too, and it seems likely she's not any more disciplined than she's been in previous years. \n\nWhat is more important, methinks, is the demand that Clinton look pretty.

Whether that persists beyond Obama is an open question. But I find it hard to believe that the massive infrastructure that OFA built will simply disappear. State-by-state changes that make it easier to register and to vote (e.g. motor-voter laws and mail-in ballots) compliment a lower cost to engaging youth voters via the internet, e-mail, and texts. \n\nAt the end of the day, every voting block you can lock up matters. If strategists can count on youth turnout in critical swing states, like say Colorado, then that frees up time and money for other targeting, more expensive/intensive targeting, ads and other messaging opportunities, and builds momentum. This is especially true when we consider that elections aren't won by a popular vote basis.

Congress however has both control over the coin and rules and government of our land and naval forces (Article 1, Section 8). So he could theoretically order everyone home, but Congress has the power to, say, deny those funds necessary for such a draw-down.\n\nBeyond that, there's huge political and foreign policy considerations in doing any of these things. Afghanistan, for example. No matter whether you agree we should still be there. If we just up and left tomorrow then the Afghani government would fall. And for all the shit we did, we owe it to them to make the transition as smooth as possible. Of course, when it comes to Iraq and Afghanistan we have all but, and will soon, respectively, remove our troops from the country, so it's really a question of waiting with these countries. Further, there are some bases that might still be in our interests. Our bases in S. Korea, for example, might be one of the few things keeping Pyongyang from turning Seoul into a crater. \n\nFinally, there are also huge logistical problems. If we returned hundreds of thousands of US troops home we'd have to find a place to house all of them, ways to feed all of them, and ways to fit them all in the US or ways to process them all for discharges. \n\n-Guantanamo. Partially-paywalled article: http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/136781/carol-rosenberg/why-obama-cant-close-guantanamo.\n\nGenerally, there's no place to put many of them. Again, the President can't just close the base because Congress controls it. Further, you can either let the prisoners go or you send them somewhere else. While the innocence of some prisoners there seems certain, there are still those who still might be guilty. So you can't let them all go. So you can either send them to the US or another country. Thanks to acts of Congress controlling funding, there is no place in the US for them to be housed. And there would be no court trials for them because Congress controls the jurisdictions of the courts, as well as their funding. Other countries are possibilities, but you have to find the right ones. They need to go to a country that's a)willing-- remember most of these guys, even if innocent, were probably associating with some shady people in order to be noticed in the first place, and that I can't think of a better way to radicalize me than to imprison me without charge or trial for a decade-- and b) secure enough to handle them. So you end up with this morass. \n\n-Finally, unwarranted surveillance of American citizens, and detention without due process, both have occurred under the Patriot Act and the NDAA. Could Obama unilaterally dismantle the NSA and the DHS without congressional approval?\n\nAs Executive Agencies the President has enormous control over the NSA and the DHS. He is their Boss and could, for example, make any use of the FISA court/wiretapping/whatever illegal per Executive Order. He could also just ask them not to do it. Of course, Congress could make that such an expensive proposition (i.e. if you tell the NSA to stop doing this then we will not fund the entire Dept. of Agriculture) that it makes no sense to do it.", "id": "t1_camjwic", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "jimibabay", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1gpfo4", "score": 7, "retrieved_on": 1430746879, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_camjwic", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1371713444", "ups": 7, "distinguished": null}

There are organizations, like say the AARP or AIPAC, etc., whose primary goal is to lobby on their issues. But within the lobbying industry there are also many smaller groups, or groups with less permanent interests. Many times companies will simply hire a lobbying firm for a specific bill or interest, or maybe they'll simply retain one lobbyist who also lobbies for several other organizations. \n\nSo, generally speaking, the powerful lobbying interests are the ones where the money and population is. Think seniors, defense spending, farmers, unions, health care, finance, media, energy, etc. But to start comparing them to each other is pretty difficult. One, the groups and their interests don't stay static over time, and two it's hard to judge their competition. Whether a lobby is more or less powerful might best be judged by how able they are to affect the change they want. But, that's not necessarily a zero-sum game, and sometimes organizations will simply not take a position on an issue.\n\nAt the end of the day I always prefer to look to people, not lobbies. Who are the influential lobbyists, politicians, bureaucrats, and staffers?

So if it's silly then you are too. \n\nb. This logic is fine, but completely nonsensical in the context of the US. If the guiding line for the continuation of something is whether or not it can be universal, then there is almost nothing that is allowable in your government. Not every member of the public can be trusted with a firearm, therefore no firearms. Not every member of the public can be trusted with classified intelligence, therefore no classified information. \n\nFurther, if we want to talk about evidence, then provide me a link to even one gun shop or state that does this. And again, and where we're going to most disagree, I think it extremely unwise to make airport travel some sort of right that requires an extreme rationale to override it. \n\n2.\"I think these concerns are not unfounded. This watch list has the **potential** for great abuse...\" Again, let's have some evidence. Yes, the government will abuse people. The difference in my world versus yours is how addressable the concern is. If, in my world, the publication of the list leads to violence, then odds are good that either serious damage or death is the result. In your world, however, someone has to jump through a few extra hoops to get on an airplane. Further, while the IRS and DOJ issues are important, I'm not convinced that some terrible evil has happened. So some Tea Party groups didn't get 501(c)(3) status as quickly as they would've liked. It's not the end of America, and it certainly doesn't result in serious harm to anyone. The best argument you can make is that the delay in status made it more difficult to run their operation and therefore more difficult to advocate for their issues and therefore some generalized harm far in the future hasn't been avoided. That's not a convincing scenario for me.\n\nSo yes, you and I are going to disagree over the \"price\" we'll pay in terms of freedom v. security. We're also going to disagree about the amount of nefarious things that are going on behind the scenes. So unless you can prove this horrible, conspiratorial price to me (and vice-versa dependent on how we view burdens) I'm not going to be persuadable.\n\n3.We have no idea about the success of the list. I think you'll agree that's disquieting, but it's also a mystery rather than something you can hang your \"limited (if any) success\" hat on. Under our form of government the National Counterterrorism Center, authorized by Congress via the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, runs the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE), aka the terrorist watch list. They report to Congress, and so indirectly, are watched by the people. That's the way a republican government works. I think you may have inroads to a good argument for oversight changes, but I don't think your solution of transparency or civilian oversight is the right way to do it. There is absolutely a need to operate in the shadows. You think it's easier to catch a terrorist when they're unsure if they're being tracked, or if they know they are? Further, the publication of information might also tell you something about the source of the information. If I'm an al-Qaeda commander and I know my cell's been identified, and since it is a cell only a limited number of people have access to that information, you think I can't figure out who leaked the information? Bang, there goes the human intelligence source that could prevent future attacks. \n\n4.That's vigilantism plain and simple, which a civil society has no need for. If the government believes that the public can help, rather than, say, attacking random Muslims with the name Mohammed, then they publish the information. Before that point, all you do is start a witch hunt, and give cover to violent nutjobs. Remember, suspected terrorists are on there too. Think of how useful Reddit was with the Boston Marathon bombings. The mob did a bang-up job there.

Or it might make organized hate groups more systematic.\n\nAgain, I think this claim is entirely unfounded.  There is no evidence to support this, and saying \"better safe than sorry\" is silly.\n\nIf we can't trust the public with the list, then maybe we need to remove the list entirely.  Or remove its impact on things like airport security or firearms purchases (which some states use to determine eligibility).\n\n&gt; And even if what you say is true, I'd much rather prefer to be stricter about avoiding violence then liberal in some unfounded concern about civil liberties protections.\n\nI think these concerns are not unfounded.  This watch list has the potential for great abuse, and as we are now seeing with the recent IRS and Media espionage debacles, the Government is hardly trustworthy enough to maintain it.\n\nThis is one of those: trade freedom for security things.  Except, we're not privy to the payout in terms of security.  In fact, we don't even know what this list is all about, who is on it, how one gets on it, etc.\n\nIt's presumably hidden away because its a \"state secret\", but this is easy cover for a whole host of state security apparatuses which can presumably be abused.\n\n&gt; The value in having it around is that it gives airlines, law enforcement agencies, and other groups the ability to flag, track, and investigate potential terrorists. It's record-keeping. It would downright impossible to try and track people without a central database.\n\nIt's one thing to keep records and track terrorists, it's another to create a list which has limited (if any) success which produced more false positives than successful captures.\n\nIf this list is not yielding success, it is a failure and should be shut down.\n\nAll in all, the whole process needs more transparency and civilian oversight.  There is no need for it to operate in the shadows.   \n\nLastly, these are suspected terrorists, correct?  Wouldn't it be helpful if people knew who they were so we can all keep an eye out for them?

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Speaking from a theoretical point of view, the government would never recognize violence as a legitimate response to governmental action.\n\nThere are political science theories that might justify armed revolt. Locke, for example, speaks of armed revolt when the social contract between individuals and their society is broken. Similarly, the Chinese have the Mandate of Heaven, which is sometimes used to justify revolution. Other thinkers have expressed similar views. These are the theoretical roots of the people who justify the 2nd Amendment on people v. government, But, at the end of the day, those are theories that are necessarily outside of the purview of the state concept.\n\nOne of the many popular definitions of sovereignty, or what makes government legitimate, is the monopoly on the use of force. That is, it's acceptable when the government executes a criminal, versus when a mob does it. At the point when the legitimacy of that monopoly is seriously questioned then you cease to have a state. You might have something like Somalia, where the Supreme Court can be openly attacked by armed militia. So by definition, the US government can't sanction armed violence against it.\n\nTheoretical considerations aside, there are policy and political questions that aren't easily answered by the generalization of \"the government isn't working.\" First, you have to define who the government isn't working for. In the mind of some, the government is certainly working on the behalf of the rich statists, or gun-hating liberals, or whoever. But those descriptions are debatable, and so you can't come to an easy conclusions about whether the government is truly broken. Since our government is founded, at the bottom of it all, by individual consent, then you have to wait and see whether revolution springs up before saying that the government is failed. That is, from an observational point-of-view the proper chain is not that government failed therefore revolution, but rather that revolution means the the government failed. \n\nAs for Syria, you're addressing an alternate framing of the question. This is not to say that you are incorrect, but rather that both your question and answer are open to debate. Some would say, including certain interpretations of a conservative Supreme Court's ruling in D.C. v. Heller, that we are not generally undermining the 2nd amendment. Some would also say that supporting freedom abroad is important, but that arming al-Qaeda or other extremists is not conducive to that end. When we start speaking in terms of values, i.e. good, bad, good for freedom, bad for freedom, etc. then we're entering a realm of grays. There's no solid answer.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Reading through some of the cases related to inherent contempt there's this nugget in McGrain v. Daughtery (http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/273/135/case.html):\n\n\"6.Each house of Congress has power, through its own process, to compel a private individual to appear before it or one of its committees and give testimony needed to enable it efficiently to exercise a legislative function belonging to it under the Constitution. P. 273 U. S. 160.\n\n7.This has support in long practice of the houses separately, and in repeated Acts of Congress, all amounting to a practical construction of the Constitution. Pp. 273 U. S. 161, 273 U. S. 167, 273 U. S. 174.\n\n8.The two houses of Congress, in their separate relations, have not only such powers as are expressly granted them by the Constitution, but also such auxiliary powers as are necessary and appropriate Page 273 U. S. 136 to make the express powers effective, but neither is invested with \"general\" power to inquire into private affairs and compel disclosures. P. 273 U. S. 173.\"\n\nIANAL, but I see a few rationales. The first is related to the whole debate about enumerated powers and exactly how far Congress can go in claiming powers necessary to its other ends. That is, testimony to Congress is essential to Congress' ability to effectively pass legislation and serve the people. Indeed, in Jurney v. MacCracken it references Kilbourn v. Thompson where the subpoena was invalid because \"there was no legislative duty to be performed.\" Mcgrain quotes Burnham v. Morrisey \"The House of Representatives has many duties to perform, which necessarily require it to receive evidence, and examine witnesses. . . . It has often occasion to acquire a certain knowledge of facts in order to the proper performance of legislative duties. We therefore think it clear that it has the constitutional right to take evidence, to summon witnesses, and to compel them to attend and to testify. This power to summon and examine witnesses it may exercise by means of committees.\"\n\nSecond, there's tradition. McGrain notes that \"[the issuance of subpoenas] has support in long practice....\" Jurney notes that, \"The power to punish a private citizen for a past and completed act was exerted by Congress as early as 1795, [Footnote 4] and since then it has been exercised on several occasions. [Footnote 5] It was asserted, before the Revolution, by the colonial Page 294 U. S. 149 assemblies, in imitation of the British House of Commons, and afterwards by the Continental Congress and by state legislative bodies.\" Out of respect for tradition and the efficacy of the procedure, the judiciary may feel that it would be contrary to reality and history to say that Congress can't do what has been, by de facto definition, an essential part of its function. \n\nIn Jurney they also frame the issue differently than concern for powers of Congress. Brandeis writes, \"Here, we are concerned not with an extension of congressional privilege, but with vindication of the established Page 294 U. S. 150 and essential privilege of requiring the production of evidence.\" So, the expansion of power issue is not nearly as important as making sure our society respects the necessity of producing evidence for a good cause.\n\nFurther, it's not a separation issue as, McGrain again, \"The ground for such fears has since been effectively removed by the decisions of this Court which hold that assertions of congressional privilege are subject to judicial review, Kilbourn v. Thompson, supra, and that the power to punish for contempt may not be extended to slanderous attacks which present no immediate obstruction to legislative processes, Marshall v. Gordon, supra.\" McGrain also notes that, \"That the power may be abused is no ground for denying its existence. It is a limited power, and should be kept within its proper bounds, and when these are exceeded, a jurisdictional question is presented which is cognizable in the courts. . . .\" The courts are claiming that they are ultimately the final arbiter, and so the judicial branch still has significant control.\n\nFinally, there is also an argument that this is unnecessary because of existing statute making refusal to answer or produce documents a crime. Jurney again: \"The statute was enacted not because the power of the Houses to punish for a past contempt was doubted, but because imprisonment limited to the duration of the session was not considered sufficiently drastic a punishment for contumacious witnesses.\" The fact that inherent contempt proceedings can only last as long as a session also make it less likely that the power would be very dangerous, and these time-limits are probably why you don't see inherent contempt anymore. \n\nI'm sure there's more (and alternative) interpretations out there.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I disagree with your claims about the status quo.\n\nThere has been, and continues to be, a lot of discussion about the VA and veterans. Today, for example, http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2013-05-22/news/bs-md-congress-va-backlog-20130522_1_va-secretary-eric-k-claims-backlog-veterans-affairs. Veterans have been consistently discussed in most media outlets, blogs, etc. Efforts by the First and Second Ladies have been consistent over the past several years, including this year: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/04/29/first-lady-michelle-obama-to-unveil-vets-program/. I'd also note that unless your complaint is coming sui generis, then you've been hearing about this somewhere too. \n\nThere has been, and continues to be, support for the VA budget, esp. under Obama as we've wound down Iraq and Afghanistan: http://www.stripes.com/va-budget-plan-calls-for-10-percent-increase-in-funding-1.215980. You can see the 2013 breakdown here: http://www.va.gov/budget/docs/summary/Fy2013_Fast_Facts_VAs_Budget_Highlights.pdf. The budget in 2009 was $87.6b, while in 2013 it will be $152.7b-- or about a 57% increase in 4 years during some of the most austere times in our budgeting. You can go here and see the 2013 breakdown: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_United_States_federal_budget#Total_revenues_and_spending. Note that the VA has the third highest discretionary budget behind our massive DoD spending and our healthcare spending (both of which probably also go a fair amount to vets.). \n\nBut, this is not a call to do less or be complacent with what we've already done. The new VA budget, for example, saw a slashing of construction funds for VA facilities. Rural vets, which make up 44% of the force, have extreme disparities in access to care. They often lack general medical people in their area to begin with, and when seeking care at a VA facility they must travel an average of 63 miles to their nearest facility. \n\nOn top of access problems, traumatic brain injuries and PTSD are extremely complicated injuries. Our understanding of these things was almost non-existent before Iraq and Afghanistan, and our treatment of them is by no means super-effective or standardized. Like many psychiatric issues they require continual monitoring with expensive tests like MRIs and CT scans, medication that often needs to be adjusted or changed, and long periods of cognitive therapy. Add this to a culture-- which is, admittedly, difficult to measure-- that one is alien to most civilians, and two, in combination, seems to equate toughness with extreme self-sufficiency and silence. We are seeing a massive influx of young men in the prime of their formative years who were exposed to massive and terrible trauma that create psychological if not psychiatric issues just as these young men are trying to transition into a life that's completely alien to what they're used to. Think of all the confusion you have as 25 year old about where you want to work, who you want to live with, etc. and add in a paralyzing fear of people and the outdoors, night terrors, substance abuse, and disturbed thinking. This is not a problem we're going to solve within a few years of withdrawing from Iraq and Afghanistan. This is a problem that will take at least a generation to address, and its consequences will be felt for generations to come.\n\nVets certainly face other problems too. Physical injuries resulting in amputation, for example, often require specialized prosthetic and extensive physical therapy. Veterans also face unemployment, esp. for younger veterans. http://www.uschamber.com/hiringourheroes/veteran-unemployment-state. There is some evidence that this isn't a terrible problem, http://www.gijobs.com/the-real-story-behind-veteran-unemployment-rates.aspx, and that it's getting better as the general market improves, http://www.navytimes.com/article/20130503/JOBS/305030003/Veterans-unemployment-rate-falls-dramatically-April. Programs to encourage the hiring of veterans exist, and certainly can't be hurting. GI benefits for education also continue to be useful and funded. \n\nIn light of all this, we're doing a lot to help veterans. I think there are two concerns that we should focus on. The first is that veterans' issues are a politicized issue. The second is budget constraints. On the first, it becomes increasingly difficult to create consensus on this issue. Both Bush and Obama have been very much about our veterans, but it's not uncommon to hear someone lob a grenade about how either of them weren't doing enough for our troops. It's an effective jab that relies more on playing to biases rather than actual reality--i.e. Bush doesn't care about the troops because all he wanted was the oil; and Obama doesn't care about the troops because he's a Communist. This makes it difficult to get everyone you need on board for a proposal. It may not be that Obama's vets to jobs program is a bad idea, but that any policy's inherent limitations meeting a disliked messenger means that people will not work as hard as they can to get on board. Accusations are a side-show that mislead and engender distrust that can poison political negotiations. \n\nSecond, we need to be concerned with the problems of budgeting. As I noted before, the treatment of vets is an absolutely massive undertaking, and even if we knew the exact way to treat PTSD, for example, effectively we could be throwing all our money at it for a decade until it disappears. The variety of services required by the VA also makes budgeting difficult. The needs of recently returned vets are not exactly similar to the older vets of previous wars. The VA is pulled in several different directions--home loans, education loans, and pensions-- and must budget appropriately. Finally, we have to consider how small our military vet population really is. Here's the veteran pop.: http://www.va.gov/vetdata/docs/QuickFacts/Population_quickfacts.pdf. That means there are a total of about 23m vets in a county of 313m. If we break it down by recent service we get 5.75m.\n\nHere are the estimates about PTSD, for example, http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/magazine/issues/winter09/articles/winter09pg10-14.html. Doing some quick back of the envelope we get about 3 million vets with PTSD symptoms. In comparison, 25.8m Americans have diabetes: http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-basics/diabetes-statistics/. PTSD is certainly important, but does it make sense to throw extremely large sums of money at it when diabetes affects so many more people? Ditto to every other health issue and concern of the US budget. How many seniors are living on the edge of their pensions and social security? The money for VA investment has to come from somewhere, and so we have to cut from something. Since mandatory spending equals about 64% of the budget, and the VA is about half discretionary, then there's not much room in the budget to pull other money from that doesn't affect entitlements.  It's not an easy decision.\n\nOverall, there's a terrible problem, and we're doing a lot to take care of it. I don't think I'd say we're doing everything we can, but we're doing quite a lot, and we'll continue to do quite a lot, to help our veterans. I disagree with your initial question not because I think your sentiment is misplaced, but because it goes back to the politicization problem. I read it framed as an us-v-them sort of thing. I think the proper question is what should we be doing, rather than why aren't we doing anything.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1e20pf", "selftext": "I really have to disagree with this concept of a politically neutral system.\n\nWhen you say that I think you mean that mathematically neither party would be disadvantaged by it in another election. But, that doesn't tell the whole story of why we choose the things we do in politics.\n\nEven in IRV voting, which you highlight, there are legitimate reasons why people would disagree with it beyond it's mathematical equivalence. For one, it's still a first-past-the-post voting system that tends to exclude third parties. It's complexity makes voter exhaustion and invalid ballots more likely. In some IRV voting systems it's also possible for everyone to get their least favorite choice. Some might say this is less preferable than at least 50% of voters getting their first choice. \n\nSimilar arguments exist for all voting systems. When we speak of voting systems we usually talk about the criteria for which they were designed. These criteria vary because different individuals value different things when it comes to designing a voting system. These values, I'd argue, are far more important in aggregate than the one value of mathematical parity. And as a huge set of values, it's hard to reach consensus on them. That's an impediment to political action right there. \n\nFurther, almost all political constituencies value some form of tradition. In the US, for example, the principles of the Constitution are heavily valued. Whether or not this is beneficial, or even rational, is not really the question when it comes to group identity. Even if we did want to consider those questions, there are good reasons to believe that a group identity is just as, if not more important, than \"fairer\" outcomes in fostering a democracy. \n\nFinally, we also exist in a reality where this cannot be changed by fiat. So the process by which our voting system must change is an extremely important factor to consider in deciding whether or not we should change voting systems. As a politician or politically involved citizen, yes, we can make the cynical argument that they won't change because it suits them to keep up with current systems. But, more charitably, we have to consider that political people have only a limited amount of time and resources. \n\nTo change the voting system like you suggest would require a massive Constitutional amendment. That would require either a) an enormous legislative effort to craft a bill that would pass both Houses and be accepted by 75% of state legislatures or b) the first ever Constitutional convention. And not only this, but everything else you had hoped to accomplish-- education reform, tax reform, ending military actions, climate change, etc.-- will be put by the wayside while we essentially have a mini-revolution. And in the end, even if this was all accomplished, you can never be guaranteed that your idea won't be changed or tossed in the process, and you end up with a voting system that is by no means clearly \"better\" than the one you had before because different people value different things.\n\nSo you have this massive impediment in front of you to change a system that, while we all bitch to no end about it, hasn't worked out so terrible. After all, aren't we a rich and prosperous 1st world country? Didn't our system lead us from podunk colony to the world's hyperpower? Sure we may complain, sure things may not be perfect, but are things really so bad that we have to upend everything? That's an easy narrative to spin, and it probably has more than just a ring of truth to it. And further, can we even guarantee that the root of our problems are political or electoral?\n\nSo in sum, I think there's resistance because 1) no system is perfect, or even self-evidently better than others, and 2) it is not self-evident that the costs of action are outweighed by the benefits of action.", "id": "t1_c9w7re3", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "jimibabay", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1e20pf", "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1431237441, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1368203352, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9w7re3", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1368203133", "ups": 4, "distinguished": null}

Korea has a system of tunnels underneath the DMZ. Of course, we're not talking about tunnels large enough to convey a sizable invasion force. There's also the fact that the two countries share a sizable coastline. S. Korea (+ the US) has a very good navy, but things would certainly be able to slip through. Then, add in cannon fodder soldiers who would be willing to cut a path across the DMZ even if it meant killing themselves. N. Korea has been staring at the DMZ for decades now, and no defense (including that minefield) is impassable or insurmountable. \n\nI'm not sure how large the force would be, but N. Korea certainly has the capability to take a large (or important: children, political leaders) number of S. Koreans hostage. Take this and add in media coverage and you have a good bargaining chip. Also, consider that even if we don't want to give an invasion force credence, you don't need more than a special forces unit to set up a nuke or dirty bomb in Seoul. Even if it's just a bluff, that's a serious bluff to call in the heart of one of the most populated cities.\n\nFurther, if I was N. Korea, I would just blame it all on a rogue general. In an extraordinary act of shame, Kim admits (perhaps privately) that a rogue general is responsible for these crimes. \n\nSo, no, I don't think that's necessarily total war. It's a very risky gamble, but it might be worth it. Who knows how much Kim's power is threatened right now? Who knows if there is an actual rogue general somewhere? Who knows how bellicose (if not insane) Kim is? If we're willing to speculate that N. Korea attacks, and doesn't go for total victory, but also doesn't just do something useless like torpedo a US ship, then it would probably look something like this. \n\n*2. I think your Iraq/Afghanistan references have merit, but you misapply them. Or, at least they aren't so clear that another strategic mind (e.g. Kim and his Generals) can't see them another way. I think those examples show that the US (esp. under Obama) would be very hesitant to commit the US to something of that magnitude. From the beginning of the invasion, the US would already be on its heels in terms of being willing to depose Kim, rather than just pull a Kuwait. They would want the job to be done mostly by S. Korea, and maybe try to rope China in. S. Korea is rhetorically committed to a reunified peninsula, but S. Korea isn't pragmatically any more committed to the project than the US is. There would be strong reasons to believe that given the right scapegoats and concessions, Kim could survive to fight another day.

But certainly not impossible. It's also more and more plausible dependent on how good your idea is and how hard you're willing to work on it. I should also note that there are people who will disagree with me. This most likely will stem from different assumptions about the usefulness of working from within and with the system. Take my suggestions as you will. \n\nYour question is extremely difficult without a lot of information. Dependent on what you're trying to do you may be looking at encouraging rule promulgation within an agency, cultural/attitudinal shifts by policy makers, legislation, constitutional amendments, or a combination of all of the above. Each policy interface requires its own set of strategies and people you need to talk to. The scope of your idea also affects how inertia you will have to overcome to implement it.\n\nBasically, decisions are made by people in the room. You need to be in that \"room.\" To be invited into that room, and to be taken seriously once you get there, you need to know the right people, and you need to be ready to knock your proposal out of the park on the first (and probably only) try. So, practically speaking, you should start finding a coalition. Who are your local environmental groups, policy centers (esp. the environmental ones), and government representatives? Seek them out, test and refine your idea, and get people on board with it. Institutional knowledge will take over from there. \n\nThen you have to be tenacious. This isn't going to be Mr. Smith going to Washington, where one good speech takes you home. You're going to be ignored if not belittled, and even if you do everything right it's going to be a long time before you go from drawing board to real changes. Things are slow-- like years and years slow--, and you need to be prepared for that. You're trying to enter a policy domain that people have been fighting over for 50+ years. There are lots of other good ideas, lots of other bad ideas, lots of entrenched interests, and lots and lots of other voices.\n\nOn a side note, it should go without saying that you need to be a personable person. The one thing that I see kill people and their ideas is that they're self-righteous assholes. For example, yes, as a constituent your elected officials will listen to you, but that doesn't mean they have to hear you. Do not threaten, pontificate, or be rude. Also, the other side is just like you. They are not evil, stupid, short-sighted, greedy, insane, wrong, or any other pejorative you can come up with. We live in a consensual society, and you will only get things done when others are willing to work with you. \n\nGood luck!", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c9dgdm5", "parent_id": "t1_c9ddq0k", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1431587787, "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1c5qtf", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9dgdm5", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1365730003", "distinguished": null, "ups": 3}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "jimibabay", "id": "t1_c9ddq0k", "parent_id": "t3_1c5qtf", "score": 9, "retrieved_on": 1431589109, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9ddq0k", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1365723038", "distinguished": null, "ups": 9}

As learning material I feel that they can help contextualize certain things (e.g understanding Marx as an extension of Hegel), but they often end up skimming over things for the sake of covering everything. If you're confused, or want background, there's plenty of places to go that aren't an enormous textbook. \n\nI'll also disagree that you *need* to study organizational theory. The Prince, for example, makes plenty of sense unless you have no idea what a Prince is. But, organizational theory is nice, which is why I prefer to go straight to the source and read Aristotle's Politics.\n\nMy primary suggestion would be to not worry so much about about reading books before hand unless you have a serious burning desire to read something. That is, read it because you want to, not because you want to get a leg up. There's a lot of context and discussion you'll have in school that you (usually) won't get just reading it by yourself. Instead, I'd suggest history books, current events, and maybe comparative politics books/textbooks. Get yourself background and it will better inform your understanding of what you read, as well as give you more evidence when it comes to arguing and discussing material.\n\nAnother point to be made: there are a large variety of poly sci curricula, styles, and approaches. Don't take me or anyone else at my word. Try different things. If the Prince is incomprehensible to you then try an introduction book. If that's too dry then try current events. If it's all to squishy and qualitative for you then check out economists, or statistical political science papers/books.

There's a variety of factors, including a recession, the appearance of crack and the rise of inner-city gangs, the War on Drugs (specifically, sentencing guidelines, mandatory minimums, and their racist outcomes), the Vietnam war (which creates transient populations, gets a lot of soldiers hooked on drugs, creates supply chains for drugs from SE asia, arguably inspires the War on Drugs under Nixon in order to create law and order), population boom from the Baby Boomers and their first generation of children, arguably a racist pushback to the Civil Rights movement from some whites in power, and the dissemination of critical thought about state institutions that inspire us to view the system this way (e.g. Communism and its resultant debates, Black Power, Civil Rights, linguistics, etc.).\n\nThis last point is important because I'm not sure I've heard much about the prison systems before the end of the 20th century.

Our system may have changed, but it seems just as explanatory to say that they haven't changed so much as we've started paying attention.

Imagine a two-term President, an elevated VP who is in office for 10 years, etc. and then imagine that they are elected to the House of Representatives. This person makes their way to the Speakership, and then the President and VP are both killed/incapacitated/disqualified, or they both resign.
