Having a pool makes you vastly more likely to accidentally drown or die when you attempt suicide.  And why is the last part necessarily a negative thing?  Why should anyone else have a say on whether you keep living? Isn't that the ultimate in personal liberty?\n\n&gt;What happened to your appreciation of statistics? How many home invasions by multiple armed men are there? If there are 20 people who might break into your home should you be allowed to keep a gatling gun in your living room? Everyone is under some kind of possible danger all the time, that doesn't sanction you being allowed everything you'd like.\n\nWho the hell cares how often it happens.  You're essentially saying that you would rather leave someone defenseless than give them the ability to defend themselves even in the most extreme situations.  Basically, you want to let 5'2, 100 pound women like me have to rely on being good with a knife to keep someone from raping or kill me.  Nice.\n\n&gt;The ATF can't check every gun seller. They can't check 1/1000 of people who sell guns. So they'll get around to making sure someone looks in on the gun show guy and that he's doing proper checks by 2017.\n\nRandom audits and harsh penalties.  Its how *every* regulator works in the US and around the world.  They cannot audit every single instance of something.  It is impossible.\n\n&gt;I like that you're speaking for all Americans. Makes things simpler. Did your natural rights come from God? Please tell me jesus loves guns. Please.\n\nIt doesn't matter where they come from.  The phrase is \"endowed by their Creator with certain, unalienable rights...\" this could be their parents upon conception, God, Allah, or the Flying Spaghetti Monster.  When a person is born, they have rights that no government should ever infringe upon.  But nice attempt at *reductio ad absurdum*.\n\n&gt;Then why hasn't it worked? As you said \"300 million guns in the US, owned by about 80 million people\". Where's the honesty? Not enough guns yet? How many guns do you have to own before the government gets honest? A billion?\n\nLets twist it another way - how many regulations do we need to make sure the banking industry is honest?  We have millions of lines of regulations, yet we always want to introduce more.  Why is  \"more is better\" okay with everything the government does to use, but not when its to make the people safer?  Lets assume you find a way to make sure no one who shouldn't have a gun never gets one.  Why then restrict how many guns someone can own?\n\n&gt;And yet, according to anyone who has been there and numerous studies, people living in Canada, Australia and the UK and most of Europe, all places with VASTLY fewer gun, fear their country LESS. And they have actual functioning democracies, unlike the US. They are LESS afraid of being subjected to government rule even though many fewer of them have a gun. Huh. Less guns and less fear. Meditate on that.\n\nIt has less to do with the type of country than the people living in that country.  We Americans are a violent lot, even if you strip out gun crime.  But we are also *far more diverse* than any of those countries, maybe except Australia.  Think Swedes would like to own a gun now?  Think the Greeks or Spanish might like to be able to stand up to their government right now?\n\n&gt;Except that nothing you could possibly own, even all 80 million of you, could possibly scare the government. The government has you beat.\n\nIf the entirety of the government and its agencies were to side against a rebellion/revolution.  So are you trying to say that those employed by the government are somehow different than the rest of us?  Aren't we supposed to be a government of, by, and for the people?  Or do we now have a superior class - first class if you're the government, second if you're not.\n\n&gt;Unless the criminal if faster on the draw, better at getting the drop or old Murray is just a bad shot. Then the criminal wins. And, thanks to people like you, he also wins a free gun! Yay! More guns for criminals! Now he can shoot more people.\n\nSo your answer instead is to give people nothing to defend themselves with except for ancient weapons?  We could use that logic with knives... lets outlaw them too.  I guess you're just a Darwinist, right?  I mean, if people can't defend themselves they deserved to be murdered?\n\n&gt;Huh, so I would guess crime is higher in Canada, Australia, the Uk and so forth, right? I mean.... fewer guns means more crime, so crime must be astronomical in those places. Right? I know you'll prove to me it is.\n\nSo why are strict gun laws working in some places and not others?  Why isn't Chicago as safe as Stockholm?", "id": "t1_ca6agif", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "JessiLae", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_ca6auf3", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;That's my point.

Heck, early in my career I did with this tax returns...\n\n&gt;But every government does infringe on them, they're called \"laws\", they all infringe on your ability to do things. Should we just stop having any of them?\n\nThis is a strawman argument.  Except for anarchists, most people agree that certain rights must be limited for the sake of the society.  Where that line is drawn varies by person/politico.  I, for one, think we have far too much intrusion.  But do you or do you not agree that there are certain rights that no government should be able to take away?\n\n&gt;Well you've obviously never lived in any of those countries ...or read a book. Go look up multiculturalism on wikipedia and compare it to your melting pot. It's a lot more diverse in Canada and a lot of Europe than it is in the US.\n\n[Canada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Canada) for example is less diverse as the US.  19% of Canadians are some sort of minority.  In the US, that number is [27.6%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States#Race_and_ethnicity).  In the UK, non-whites are about [9-10%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom#Ethnicity) of the population.  The US is more diverse.\n\n&gt;Or tasers... or pepper spray... or jujitsu... or a well funded police force... or an alarm.... or a bat. Are those all ancient weapons? \n\nTasers might be a good answer, maybe even pepper spray.  But both have rather limited effective rangers.  And you reply to someone who has claimed to be a small woman and say that juitisu is a variable option?  A police force or alarm company, no matter how well funded, is not there to protect you from crime occuring.  They are there to respond to crime.  If someone bursts into a house, the police will be there in minutes.  But even 2 minutes is an awfully long time. \n\n&gt;None of them make it super easy to kill 8 people in less than a minute though.\n\nEven with a 15-round magazine, I would love to see someone try to hit 8 moving targets with lethal accuracy.  I would bet a good deal that even someone considered highly trained would have problems with that.  But to piggy off your last part - why not just give them an alarm or a police force to protect them?  That's what we're discussing - legal ownership of a firearm.  We have too many guns to eliminate them all - we operate in the realm of possible.\n\n&gt;Because it's easy to get guns across state lines.\n\nTrue, but why are people bringing them in?  There are laws against that.

I'm glad we agree. \n\n&gt;But do you or do you not agree that there are certain rights that no government should be able to take away?\n\nThe government limits every right you have in some way, so your question is moot. \n\n&gt;Canada for example is less diverse as the US. 19% of Canadians are some sort of minority. In the US, that number is 27.6%. In the UK, non-whites are about 9-10% of the population. The US is more diverse.\n\nHuh? I didn't realize that the percentage of visible minorities was the indicator for diversity. Where I live there is a large russian community, among many others. I guess that doesn't count as diversity since they are pretty much all white?  \n\n&gt;We have too many guns to eliminate them all - we operate in the realm of possible.\n\nSo if we can't get rid of everything then we should get rid of nothing. Good argument. I'm glad you're not in charge of small pox vaccinations. \n\n&gt;True, but why are people bringing them in? There are laws against that. Why aren't they obeying them?\n\nBecause they like guns? They are an extremely effective tool for getting what you want. That's why it confuses us why you want criminals to have so many of them.

Shooting yourself in the head is easy and the pain only lasts an instant. It helps if you think before you reply. \n\n&gt;You're essentially saying that you would rather leave someone defenseless than give them the ability to defend themselves even in the most extreme situations. Basically, you want to let 5'2, 100 pound women like me have to rely on being good with a knife to keep someone from raping or kill me. Nice.\n\nA knife... or a taser... or pepper spray... or a whistle... or jujitsu... or police.... etc. \nWant to know where fewer women get killed per capita? Canada. Australia. The UK. Actually pretty much all of Europe. \nBasically, you want the 5'2 woman to have to defend herself against someone with gun instead of someone without a gun. Why do you hate women so much? \n\n&gt;They cannot audit every single instance of something. It is impossible.\n\nThat's my point. So the gun show seller says \"meet me around back\" and makes a an extra grand selling guns to people with no background check and never gets caught. \n\n&gt;When a person is born, they have rights that no government should ever infringe upon. \n\nBut every government does infringe on them, they're called \"laws\", they all infringe on your ability to do things. Should we just stop having any of them? If we're going to have some of them then the debate is about which ones and pointing out imaginary inalienable rights that come from anywhere and nowhere doesn't make any kind of useful point about anything. \n\n&gt;Why is \"more is better\" okay with everything the government does to use, but not when its to make the people safer?\n\nBecause your question rests on the demonstrably false assumption that guns make people safer. It is safer to live in countries with fewer guns. Crime is lower there. Fewer people get killed per capita. Less crime = more safe. Once you understand that you understand why the government is allowed to limit things. It saves lives. Read the part in your sacred constitution about \"promoting the general welfare\". \n\n&gt;It has less to do with the type of country than the people living in that country. We Americans are a violent lot, even if you strip out gun crime. \n\nYeah, being armed to the teeth has nothing to do with your paranoid sense of fear of one another. Right. \n\n&gt;But we are also far more diverse than any of those countries, maybe except Australia. \n\nWell you've obviously never lived in any of those countries ...or read a book. Go look up multiculturalism on wikipedia and compare it to your melting pot. It's a lot more diverse in Canada and a lot of Europe than it is in the US. \n\n&gt;So your answer instead is to give people nothing to defend themselves with except for ancient weapons? \n\nOr tasers... or pepper spray... or jujitsu... or a well funded police force... or an alarm.... or a bat. Are those all ancient weapons? None of them make it super easy to kill 8 people in less than a minute though. \n\n&gt;We could use that logic with knives... lets outlaw them too.\n\nBut knives aren't making it super easy to kill 8 people in a few seconds. Guns are a huge leap forward in killing technology. That's why criminals like them so much. I don't know why you want criminals to have so many effective killing devices. What do you have against homeowners and law abiding citizens that you want the criminals to be able to kill thems so easily? \n\n&gt;Why isn't Chicago as safe as Stockholm?\n\nBecause it's easy to get guns across state lines. \n\n\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1f26v2", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ca6auf3", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1369579946", "ups": -2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_ca63okh", "score": 10, "retrieved_on": 1431028122, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ca6agif", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1369578193", "ups": 10, "distinguished": null}

You're probably right that we need to write a law making it illegal for the mentally defective to possess firearms in order to actually do something about it.  \n\nso if you accept the premise that possession laws don't require registration to be enforceable, and 0% of the possible cases fall into the catch 22 in which you describe, then aren't we just spinning our wheels for nothing? \n\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; any private sale is not subject to a background check (IIRC ~30-40% of sales).\n\nThe 40% statistic is over 20 years old. I haven't heard of a newer one. However, I've been to gun shows, and can confirm that 99.9% of sales there go through background checks. (Because all of the dealers are FFLs). As the washington post and others have [pointed out](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/the-stale-claim-that-40-percent-of-gun-sales-lack-background-checks/2013/01/20/e42ec050-629a-11e2-b05a-605528f6b712_blog.html), even that ancient 40% statistic is on extremely shaky grounds, due to poor design and extremely small sample size.\n\n&gt;not in all circumstances, what about the law that says felons can't possess weapons? (besides obviously running afoul of the 2nd Amendment)\n\nPreventing felons from possessing weapons, AFAIK, does not conflict with the 2A, and this was held as such in the Heller SCOTUS decision, so I have no problem with that restriction. In general, I support the other groups of people that are excluded in the Heller decision as well, but with the caveat that restriction of this right should be subject to due process. \n\nDue process is automatic in the case of a felony conviction, but no framework currently exists for the application of due process for restricting the right when it comes to mentally ill. There was a case recently where a woman was forcibly committed under false grounds, and that was used as a basis for confiscation. That sort of thing has to be prevented.\n\n&gt; i'd say it's not a pre-requisite for registration to enforce a possession law.\nIt's not a prerequisite unless you want the policy to actually prevent any violence. For instance, in most states possession of a weapon during the commission of a felony is just a \"tack on\" charge where it's just used to rack up penalties... but could never prevent the felony. It's what prosecutors use to cover their ass if they can't make the other charges stick.\n\nBut to prevent anything, you would have to know that the felon possessed a weapon outside of the commission of a crime. Registration is required for that, otherwise you would have to search them without due cause (4A violation). Otherwise there's no way to get the weapon before the commission of a crime or other condition of reasonable suspicion (and the same standards apply to that suspicion for felons and non-felons).\n\nSo, while a law against possession can be on the books, it will never prevent anything without registration.\n\n&gt; so there's only 2 reasons why you couldn't pass a background check (ie acquire registration), i think. mental defect and felon status.\n\nNICS form 4473 lists the following 11 questions (answers required to pass in parenthesis):\na. Are you the purchaser/trasnferee of the firearm (to prevent straw purchases)(YES)\nb. Are you under indictment or info for a felony (NO)\nc. Have you been convicted of a felony (NO)\nd. Are you a fugative (NO)\ne. Are you an unlawfuluser, or addicted to, pot, depressant, stims, narcotics, or controlled substances.(NO)\nf. Have you been adjucated mentally defective, *or* committed to a mental institution (NO)\ng. Dishonorable discharge from armed forces (NO)\nh. Are you subject to court order for harassing, stalking, etc domestic (NO)\ni. Have you been convicted of misdomeanor domestic violence (NO)\nj. Have you renounced US citizenship (NO)\nk. Are you an illegal alien (NO)\nl. Alien under nonimmigrant visa(NO)\n\nAlso, under current rules, the background check information can't be stored nationally as a registration of firearms ownership (there are time limits involved), but most records are held at the FFL's location.\n\n&gt; so if you accept the premise that possession laws don't require registration to be enforceable, and 0% of the possible cases fall into the catch 22 in which you describe, then aren't we just spinning our wheels for nothing? \n\nI don't accept as above, as I reject the law as completely useless if it can't be used to prevent crime. Registration is required for prevention (as I outlined above), and using registration information for this prosecution is specifically prevented by the Haynes decision.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bzzlb", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I've been to shows in FL and TX where it has been the case that all dealers with tables tend to be FFLs (charging full retail or more, actually).

You're reducing the quality of care.  That's a good thing?\n\n&gt;Reduce their costs. Subsidize or eliminate medical school debt through public hospital service. Adjust malpractice laws and make it so doctors who really shouldn't be doctors aren't doctors so they don't keep jacking up the malpractice rates.\n\nSo now you want to mess with the market, forcing all doctors who are not independently wealthy to go through certain hospitals to eliminate debt.  Then you're going to restrict the number of doctors... Yes, there are some doctors that probably shouldn't be in practice, but a good number of malpractice cases are just accidents and human errors.  You cannot eliminate those.\n\n&gt;That actually increases cost. Preventative care is almost absurdly cheaper then dealing with the problems that arise down the line. We're not talking even pennies on the dollar sometimes but pennies on the thousand. In fact if more people had access to routine preventative care and checkups claims that require significant portions of the pool to balance out will be much much rarer and costs will plummet.\n\nNot all preventive care would reduce cost, not in total.  Say that the risk of a group of 100 people getting a disease is 0.01% annually, with a cost of treatment of $10,000.  If that preventative care costs more than $100 (0.01 x 10k), you actually spend *more* trying to prevent the disease in that population than treating it.\n\nIn fact, you might actually spend *more* in the end because you might find out that the risk is actually 0.02%, but that extra .01% died before being detected.\n\nMost \"preventative care\" is really just aimed at early detection.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I don't even know where to begin.\n\n&gt;The Basics: the government, right after WW2, decided that America had to do something about the fact that the only people that had health insurance were the elderly, and that was like 20% of the population. So they looked around, saw that lots of people had jobs and lots of people didn't want the government providing healthcare, and decided on the path they would take. they would use tax breaks to entice businesses to offer health insurance to its workers, and that would get the number of Americans with health insurance up significantly in a short period of time. The plan was never to cover everyone, it was to get the number of Americans with health insurance up from 20% in the easiest, fastest manner possible.\n\nEmployer provided health insurance (major medical) arouse during WW2 because of the wage freeze, but companies still needed to compete.  They decided to treat it as a sort of reimburseable expense (for example, if you turn in an out of pocket expense and your employer reimburses you, that is not income to you, but the corporation gets to deduct it as an expense).  That saved them taxes and provided a tangible benefit to employees.  The market then took over and it became a standard benefit of most employers.\n\n&gt;And because you are employed, you likely don't qualify for Medicaid. So your only choice is an individual plan, and the health insurance companies know that.\n\nNot sure what this has to do with anything.  The plans that are offered and priced are based on individual risks, which you then allude to here:\n\n&gt;every other developed country in the world leverages **their whole population to spread out the cost and keep spending down while providing quality healthcare.** the more people you can get on your plan, the larger your pool of people, and the lower the premiums are. As a self-employed individual, you're joining a comparatively TINY pool of people in which to spread the cost amongst, so your rate is sky high. \n\nExcept then you make a mistake, which I bolded.  Even if we adopted this sort of thing *today*, overall costs would not go down aside from the profit that the health insurance companies are making.  The only way to reduce costs is to do one or more of three things:\n\n1. Reduce consumption\n2. Reduce reimbursements/prices for procedures\n3. Refuse to cover procedures (an extreme of #2)\n\nAll three of those will be a degradation of healthcare.  If you don't allow people to consume as much (wait times, etc), that's a negative.  If you pay less for procedures, doctors/nurses/etc will leave on the margins.  And if you outright refuse to cover procedures, those who would have used it are harmed.\n\n&gt;You can't buy insurance across state lines, which further diminishes your pool from which to spread the risk. The premise behind that is each state faces different needs from health insurance. For example, Pennsylvania with its coal mines is going to demand different levels of coverage for different things than like Hawaii. If you could buy across state lines, then the state can't be sure you're getting good coverage that works for the people of that state. \n\nActually, you can thank federal law for that more than individual needs.  The vast majority of people in Penn will never need coverage for issues coal miners face.  That's just an excuse.  What this does, and you hinted at it, is break one market into 50 smaller markets (does DC have their own rules?), restricting competition.  Yes, some argue that there will be a race to the bottom, but that's only one way to compete - Neiman Marcus is a shining example that you can compete on premium.\n\nWe could solve the issue of health insurance if we used it as health insurance rather than some sort of pre-paid medical expense.  It should not cover routine preventative care - the way insurance is designed, it just inflates that cost.

You were buying 5 widgets, but decide to take the deal.  your average cost per widget drops to 80 cents, but your total expenditure rises to 8 dollars.\n\n&gt;Or we could not spend as much money on things which have no right costing that much like the vast majority of drugs used in hospitals. You could keep older machines which may not have the same speed and resolution as the newest toys but are more then adequate enough for the cursory search MRIs done on intake.\n\nall of those things are reducing consumption.  Such reductions might be a good idea, but that doesn't mean they aren't reductions in consumption.\n\n&gt;Reduce their costs. Subsidize or eliminate medical school debt through public hospital service.\n\nthat reduces the cost to doctors.  it doesn't reduce the cost for society as a whole.\n\n&gt; Adjust malpractice laws and make it so doctors who really shouldn't be doctors aren't doctors so they don't keep jacking up the malpractice rates.\n\nthis is incoherent, but there is no way that reducing the number of doctors doesn't increase the cost of medical care.\n\n&gt;That actually increases cost. Preventative care is almost absurdly cheaper then dealing with the problems that arise down the line.\n\nif that is the case, then insurance companies will pay for it on their own.  you don't need the government to tell companies to do things that will make them money.

They certainly didn't have to be complicit in helping private companies offer more benefits to their employees.  The government could have taxed the benefits just like cash wages had they wanted to, but it was a cheap/easy/minimally-government-handed way to increase health insurance consumption as to help \"provide for the...general welfare of the United States\" (Article1, Section 8, clause 1) \n\n2. the point of the remark was to show that if the OP wanted healthcare, he has no choice but to buy an individual plan through a private insurer no matter what the cost.  I went over the other options that exist in the marketplace for people that don't have health insurance and want it (such as joining the plan of a company he doesn't work for, or getting it through the government) and why they're not available to him.   \n\n3.

I didn't say i believed it, so you're assuming something about my position, and u know what they say about when you ASSume, no?  \n\nI think people that argue against your position would say that that the ideas you propose would never happen, and therefore are thought exercises.  They would likely argue that it's untenable to (in practical terms) successfully straddle that line between socialist and capitalist.   The government has to force socialist kind of policies onto the marketplace against major corporations and ideologies (at a time when corporate donations to PACs and re-election coffers move the needle much farther and easier than constituents' wants and needs do) while at the same time keeping it capitalist by leaving the majority of the decision-making and execution to the profit-driven private sector.  People would argue that it's not possible to find a balance anyone would agree on, could be passed into law, and implemented as designed.\n\n&gt;Except then you make a mistake, which I bolded. Even if we adopted this sort of thing today, overall costs would not go down aside from the profit that the health insurance companies are making.\n\ntheir leveraging of universal healthcare is combined with a different way of going about doing healthcare entirely, such as government bargaining with providers, training for doctors, tort law, etc. I don't suggest that we simply insure the whole population while making no substantive changes to the system.   but the fact remains that one way that they keep costs down is by insuring everyone.

Let's translate that to the gun debate: you might feel threatened by the fact that I own guns (or certain guns, or certain accessories like a magazine with a certain capacity). So what? The fact that I own guns is not an imminent threat to anyone.

That's ridiculous. In Warren v DC, the SCOTUS ruled that the police only have a duty to protect an individual if a \"special relationship exists\". Even if there's a restraining order, the police cannot be sued for failing to protect an individual (Castle Rock v Gonzales). It is not the government's duty to protect you from everything that could go wrong.\n\n&gt;pursuing and obtaining safety\n\nHaving the right to pursue and obtain safety is not the same as having the right to feel safe. When it comes to guns, trying to get an Assault Weapon Ban passed is not pursuing or obtaining safety; the DoJ said that the effect of the 1994 AWB was too small to measure. Therefore, an Assault Weapon Ban merely makes you *feel* safer.

Among these are enjoying and defending life and\nliberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and **pursuing\nand obtaining safety**, happiness, and privacy.\n\nOh look, *another* document pointing to a right to safety.

I'm not arbitrarily claiming I have a right to safety; I quoted three different documents that point to the right I'm discussing.\n\nAs I keep saying, you have to show some evidence that you have a right. Would you not challenge someone who says they have a right to heavy ordnance (artillery, missiles, bombs, etc)? Assuming they're American, you'd probably request some evidence that the US government recognizes a right to heavy ordnance. I'm holding you to that standard: you quoted one source that has no effect on US law, and hasn't been effectively enforced elsewhere. You quoted two more that *mention* safety but do not guarantee a right to it. \n\n&gt;It's funny that you mention this, because it's what I'm talking about. If a random burglar breaks into my home, even if he has no weapons and 0 chance of killing me, I am within my rights to kill him because he is a threat to my safety.

You can't fire a warning shot because firing a warning shot shows that he is not an imminent threat. Let's translate that to the gun debate: you might feel threatened by the fact that I own guns (or certain guns, or certain accessories like a magazine with a certain capacity). So what? The fact that I own guns is not an imminent threat to anyone. If it *becomes* an imminent threat, my guns *can* be taken away; for instance, if I'm accused of stalking someone, she might get a restraining order. \n\n&gt;By the way, Court cases only rise when a right is violated. Absence of a Court case explicitly stating that safety is a right has no bearing on the existence of that right. Brown v Board didn't invent the idea of racial equality. Roe v Wade didn't just poof the idea of abortion into existence. Your argument shows a serious misunderstanding of how rights work in the American legal system.\n\nAre you saying that, while everybody has a right to safety, it's never been violated? That's ridiculous. In Warren v DC, the SCOTUS ruled that the police only have a duty to protect an individual if a \"special relationship exists\". Even if there's a restraining order, the police cannot be sued for failing to protect an individual (Castle Rock v Gonzales). It is not the government's duty to protect you from everything that could go wrong.\n\n&gt;pursuing and obtaining safety\n\nHaving the right to pursue and obtain safety is not the same as having the right to feel safe. When it comes to guns, trying to get an Assault Weapon Ban passed is not pursuing or obtaining safety; the DoJ said that the effect of the 1994 AWB was too small to measure. Therefore, an Assault Weapon Ban merely makes you *feel* safer. You do *not* have a right to *feel* safer, though you might (if you live in CA) have the right to *pursue* and *obtain* safety (for instance, by shooting a burglar who is an *imminent* threat to your safety).", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Kaluthir", "id": "t1_c93zfgi", "parent_id": "t1_c93ywct", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431730383, "controversiality": 0, "edited":

Laws derive their power from the ability of their creator and executors to point to where they are entrusted with the power to create and enforce such laws.\n\nAgain, the constitution is just a piece of paper. It holds no power. It has no consciousness. There are no absolutes in lawmaking. Texts get reinterpreted, changed, and destroyed. Just because I write on a document: \"This can never be changed and is true for everybody.\" and 12(?) people sign it, doesn't mean that it is. It's true because it isn't too great an inconvenience for most people. Even if you sign to it, contracts get breached all the time. If both sides don't care than there are no consequences. It is true that some people only care because it's written on a piece of paper. But once enough people don't, they don't matter. I know you mean it in abstract way when you say that it gives power, but many people seem to forget that it's just a piece of paper. If you believe in something because it was constitutional, you're saying imo \"I have no other reason than that I like it that way for personal reasons\". For gun laws that certainly holds true for many people. I don't know what channels you have to go through legally to change your (the U.S.) constitution. It's not impossible is it? At least appending is?\n\n&gt; It only goes in one direction. Especially when it comes to gun rights, once you cross a certain threshold there is no going back, people are stupid and easily scared so they can be browbeaten into thinking guns are evil and scary like in the movies and lack of real experience means they will never change their mind. As guns become irrationally harder to procure the number of people with real experience shrinks dramatically as the older generations die off.\n\n&gt; (Ratchet effect)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet_effect]\n\nSo there are subjective reasons you believe that? I was wondering. The wiki talks about a lot of other things. There is no real ratchet effect in law making, other than that laws are going in a certain direction just as the world is going in a certain direction. The world is ever changing and the idea of a ratchet effect seems a lot like subjective evidence (is that the right word). Is that word used a lot (Ratchet effect)? Rights can be lost and given. If more rights are lost than given, there can be an abundance of reasons (chance for example), but mostly because laws are unspecific and people use loopholes or new things develop and laws have to adapt.\n\n&gt; And yeah: \"modifying\" right is removing them. The only people who talk of \"modifying\" rights are people who want to strip them away. Remember, we're not removing your right to free speech, we're just modifying it so everyone can feel safe: no bad language, nothing that can make people upset, nothing counter-cultural, and naturally no criticisms of the government.\n\nRights are strengthened too. I won't name any examples because I'm on my phone and I don't really know too much about legal decisions in the US and you wouldn't be interested in German decisions.\n\n&gt; Sure, so why isn't her right to own the tools she needs to survive withheld from her out of fear that they might, possibly, and statistically unlikely, hurt someone else?\n\nBecause, and that is my reason I don't want guns in untrained (and even hobby-like trained) hands around me, because she can use that gun to very easily kill me, without even wanting to. Yes, there are other ways I could die without someone wanting me to. But I'm trying to minimize that while still living a normal life. You are talking how it is statistically unlikely she will, it is just as statistically unlikely someone else will want to hurt her and that she can use that weapon to stop him, if not even more unlikely. The balance is very slightly tipped in favor of the mother being allowed to kill her own child to save her own life. In the same way it is tipped against just anyone being allowed to carry a gun. I think all this debate comes from people that like the power and/or need to feel some mostly false sense of security. My uncle once moved from a very nice house to one not so nice because his neighbor had a pit-bull. While I can understand why he is afraid, the fear is irrational and it cost him a lot. The same goes for gun rights in my opinion. It basically boils down to this: \"I understand your fear. I just think it is irrational and not helping. The same way I understand my own fear of guns around me and know it is irrational and not helping.\"\n\nEdit: Had a bug with my phone. So I couldn't continue writing.

OP is a female, and she's made it quite clear that she opposes legal abortion.\n\nIf the only issue is hypocrisy, then aren't you forced to conclude that gun rights advocates who are also pro-life are hypocrites by the same logic?

We can go down that road, but it's a long one, and I don't think I have time for that sort of debate right now.\n\nThat's your prerogative, but then you might want to reconsider your decision to enter such a debate. \n\n&gt; Since we probably won't agree on whether access to assault weapons is \"good\" or \"bad\", we'll just have to stick to legal constitutional arguments.\n\nI could not disagree more. Obviously I acknowledge that DC v. Heller and McDonald v. Chicago exist. Even vehement gun control proponents do not dispute this, so what's to argue? The only interesting question is whether those standards are good and deserve to be upheld, and I firmly reject the defeatist notion that we'll never find middle ground. In fact, I suspect we already agree about most classes of weapons, and we're really only quibbling over a small subset that are legitimately under dispute. Now, if you choose not to discuss the merits question, fine. But don't pretend the only option is to ignore it.\n\n&gt; You don't have to agree, but that doesn't mean you can change it or do anything about it.\n\nDon't be silly -- of course someone can do something about it. If you think you have a valid argument, you can raise or support a new legal challenge in the courts that might lead to the precedent being overturned. You can try to amend the constitution. Or you can craft a more narrowly tailored policy that accomplishes similar goals while fitting inside the boundaries the Supreme Court has laid out.\n\n&gt; Such an amendment would fail on it's merits, and the legislators who proposed and supported it would face difficult re-election campaigns.\n\nReally? What makes you so sure? [Polls](http://www.pollingreport.com/guns.htm) have shown that somewhere around 44-57% of Americans would favor an assault weapons ban, and a plurality say they'd be *more* likely to vote for a member of Congress who voted for it.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1b46fm", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; You're right that she is probably female, but she never specifically says that.\n\nLOL, the words \"my womb\" don't tip you off?\n\n&gt;  I don't give pro-life people any slack either, they are just as bad as gun control advocates, they both want to restrict our rights.\n\nFair enough, though that sort of false equivalence strikes me as naive. You take it as a given that the \"right\" to do X is exactly the same as the \"right\" to do Y, but most people don't think that way and there's no objective reason one can't agree with one \"right\" and disagree with another, on the *merits* of each. \n\n&gt; You're correct that she is arguing guns on their merits, and I think she is doing a good job at it. I'm just here to support her arguments with the constitutional arguments.\n\nNobody disputes that Heller, etc. is the the current judicial precedent, so I'm not sure what support you're hoping to provide.\n\n&gt; I haven't seen any arguments from you that those standards are bad and should be struck down with a constitutional amendment. All you said was that you are personally ambivalent to gun control, and that if people legitimately need a \" military-grade assault rifle\", that we have much bigger problems we need to discuss in our society, which I agreed with.\n\nThat was my argument because that's my position. I *am* personally ambivalent to gun control, and I don't claim to have a firm preference in terms of what those standards should be. I *am* generally favorable toward the right to gun ownership, but I acknowledge that hypothetically, *some* additional restrictions could be beneficial (no, I'm not entirely sure what, but I'm open-minded to ideas and counter-arguments against those ideas). What I disagree firmly with are blanket statements that any and all additional regulations on gun ownership would be bad.\n\n&gt; Incidentally, \"military-grade assault rifles\" have been banned for civilian manufacture and sale since 1986, and they aren't what is being discussed in this round of gun control, we are discussing \"military style assault weapons\", which are not military grade, and are not assault rifles.\n\nYes, I know and agree. I was making a distinction between guns you *can* have and guns you *can't* have, because the OP was worried about the lives that would be lost due to lack of access to guns. My point was, if there's some realistic situation in which having only a handgun (an allowed weapon) instead of a military-grade assault weapon (a banned weapon) is going to cost us lives, why aren't we talking about whatever the heck that is? Is it the government sending the Marines to kill someone in their home? Is it a zombie invasion? Whatever it is that's costing lives and too powerful for mere handguns, I'd like to be forewarned.\n\n&gt;  You are willing to tolerate the prohibition of a class of weapon which is functionally the same as weapons which you don't want to prohibit, while I want to allow unrestricted access to weapons that are functionally much more deadly and dangerous than the ones which are currently unrestricted.\n\nI don't believe I ever expressed a personal opinion on the ban. My argument was only that, in principle, *some weapons* are dangerous enough to ban, and that *proponents of the AWB* believe that includes this type of weapon. I was quibbling with the OP's sweeping blanket statements.\n\n&gt; Except that's exceedingly difficult, the lower courts will decide based on DC V Heller, and it will never make it to the supreme court to be overturned. They would refuse the case, letting the lower court rulings stand. It's not easy to directly contradict a prior ruling, they must take prior rulings into consideration in all new decisions. Also exceedingly difficult. Good luck getting 3/4 of the states to ratify.\n\nOf course it's difficult. So what? We can't even discuss what's good and bad because it's *hard* to make changes? What kind of defeatist attitude is that?\n\n&gt; Most people don't know the definition of an assault weapon.\n\nI agree. But you're the one counting on those ignorant people to defeat lots of incumbents on the basis of this one issue they apparently don't know much about.\n\n&gt; Anyway, it takes a lot more than 57% to get something done. Around 70% favored the public option for healthcare, and around 70% favored ending the bush tax cuts for the rich, but we didn't get either of those things.\n\nThat's just silly. If it took more than 70% public approval to get anything done, then nothing would ever get done. The public isn't that unified about virtually *anything* non-trivial. The numbers you've cited here only highlight the rareness of single-issue voting, which actually undermines your assertion that \"the legislators who proposed and supported it would face difficult re-election campaigns.\" ", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; You act as if there is no discussion about gun control going on.

That doesn't make any sense.\n\n&gt; That's a big reason we don't have a direct democracy, so that the majority can't remove the rights from the minority on a whim. Congress, and the courts, are supposed to make it hard, and slow, to change things, especially big things like our right to keep and bear arms.\n\nYes, you can probably assume everyone here has taken a high school civics class, too. The fact remains that lots of things do get done with far less than 70%, and even far less than 50% public approval. \n\n&gt;  Gun rights are the single largest issue people choose to become single issue voters based on\n\nThat's a strong empirical assertion. Evidence?\n\n&gt; Gun rights are the single largest issue people choose to become single issue voters based on, and gun right proponents are vocal, active, and vote in midterms.\n\nOkay, but that doesn't mean there shouldn't be a serious national conversation, or that people who support gun control should stop trying.\n\n&gt; You don't have to believe me, you'll see in 2014.\n\nOkey dokey?

Of gun owners, most do not own assault weapons of the type prominent Democratic politicians are trying to ban, and most would easily pass the most stringent of background checks. If the laws came to pass, your average gun owner might see, at most, a slightly longer delay, a more complicated form to fill out, an extra $5 fee, etc. \n\nI mention that only to point out that for most people this is purely an academic issue. Whether the currently proposed gun control measures pass or not, they aren't going to be personally affected in any meaningful way.\n\nMany people agree with the Constitutional argument against gun control, or the slippery-slope argument, or have a variety of other reasons they oppose it. But to expect any significant number of people, *who will not be personally affected by the law*, to abandon their lifelong party and other interests over it is naive. \n\nFor most people, something has to have an impact on them personally to turn them into a single issue voter. Otherwise, it comes down to your passions, and there just aren't that many Democrats that are more passionate about gun rights than they are about education, equality, and social programs.\n\nAdd to that the fact that most people won't change their party affiliation regardless of the facts or positions of the candidate, and/or don't pay enough attention to the debate to know what is going on, and I think the \"damage\" you are talking about is almost entirely imaginary.

Which is ridiculous.\n\nNow you are saying something much more reasonable, that the Democrats will get creamed in 2014 because midterm elections generally go against the party who won the White House, and conservatives tend to be more reliable about voting in the off-season.

These Democrats, who as you say realize this law will make no difference, *will vote based on other issues*, just as they did before Sandy when no one was talking about gun control. They won't head to the polls to defend supporters of the law, they'll head to the polls to defend the same candidates they've voted for in the past, and to support the same issues that were important to them in the past.

I don't give pro-life people any slack either, they are just as bad as gun control advocates, they both want to restrict our rights.\n\nAgain, OP never specifically said she was pro-life, and even if she is, it's not relevant to her argument.

I just said that they aren't protected by the second amendment, which they aren't.

They are semi-automatic rifles, functionally no different from hunting rifles which are exempted from the ban.  [Watch this video where a sheriff describes the differences between an assault weapon and a normal hunting rifle, and demonstrates the differences in effectiveness of 10 round magazines vs 30 round magazines in both an assault weapon and an ordinary hunting rifle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=A1bu7Y8iwXA)\n\nI think it's important to be clear on our terminology so we know what we're really talking about.\n\nAnyway, the need argument, we don't ban things just because some of us think that no one needs them.  I don't think anyone needs tobacco, but we still can't ban it, because people want it.  I don't think anyone needs cars that can exceed 100 mph, but we haven't enforced a top speed of 100 mph in all new cars.\n\nThe fact is that some people do think they need these weapons, so even setting aside the constitutional argument, they should not be banned.  Listen to the senate judiciary committee arguments on the AWB and magazine limits, the pro-gun side made the more compelling arguments.\n\n&gt;In fact, I suspect we already agree about most classes of weapons, and we're really only quibbling over a small subset that are legitimately under dispute.\n\nWell, I don't think we'd agree, because I dislike the supreme court's interpretation.  I think the NFA should have been thrown out in US V Miller, and I think we should have a constitutionally protected right to own short barrelled shotguns/rifles, silencers, machine guns, and destructive devices like grenade launchers and grenades.\n\nUnfortunately, we don't have such rights because the US V Miller case was wrongly decided, in my opinion.  However, I can't go back in time and change that, so I must live with the modern day consequences of that decision.\n\n&gt; But don't pretend the only option is to ignore it.\n\nI think the only option is to ignore it because we will not agree, so in the end we must fall back on constitutional arguments.  You are willing to tolerate the prohibition of a class of weapon which is functionally the same as weapons which you don't want to prohibit, while I want to allow unrestricted access to weapons that are functionally much more deadly and dangerous than the ones which are currently unrestricted.\n\nI'm happy you at least seem ambivalent about the ban, but that doesn't make the ban a good idea.\n\n&gt;Don't be silly -- of course someone can do something about it. If you think you have a valid argument, you can raise or support a new legal challenge in the courts that might lead to the precedent being overturned. \n\nExcept that's exceedingly difficult, the lower courts will decide based on DC V Heller, and it will never make it to the supreme court to be overturned.  They would refuse the case, letting the lower court rulings stand.  It's not easy to directly contradict a prior ruling, they must take prior rulings into consideration in all new decisions.\n\n&gt;You can try to amend the constitution.\n\nAlso exceedingly difficult.  Good luck getting 3/4 of the states to ratify.\n\n&gt;Or you can craft a more narrowly tailored policy that accomplishes similar goals while fitting inside the boundaries the Supreme Court has laid out.\n\nWell, some politicians can try, and they can be voted out of office for it.  I'm pushing hard for voter turn out in 2014 to vote out all anti-gun legislators from both federal government and state governments.\n\n&gt;Really? What makes you so sure? Polls have shown that somewhere around 44-57% of Americans would favor an assault weapons ban, and a plurality say they'd be more likely to vote for a member of Congress who voted for it.\n\nMost people don't know the definition of an assault weapon.  Even you might fall into that category.  Lots of people mistake them for fully automatic weapons, and don't realize they are functionally the same, and not any more lethal, than hunting weapons which are exempted from the ban.  In fact, there are lots of hunting weapons far more lethal than an AR-15, the AR-15 shoots small bullets designed for people, which are relatively small animals.  Those rounds aren't even legal for deer hunting in some states because it is considered inhumane.  There are MUCH larger and more lethal rounds that can be used in semi-automatic hunting rifles with 30 round magazines and would remain legal because they are not classified as \"assault weapons\".\n\nAnyway, it takes a lot more than 57% to get something done.  Around 70% favored the public option for healthcare, and around 70% favored ending the bush tax cuts for the rich, but we didn't get either of those things.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93m9be", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364420529", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1b46fm", "selftext": "&gt;OP is a female, and she's made it quite clear that she opposes legal abortion.\n\nI am not against abortion.

The OP was not complaining about abortion, the OP was complaining that so many people want to ban assault weapons, which he sees as an infringement of his constitutional rights.\n\nOP never said he disagrees with Roe V Wade, or that abortion shouldn't be a constitutionally protected right.  He is saying that since it is a constitutionally protected right, he considers it hypocritical that abortion supporters are often the same people who support an assault weapon ban, something he sees as a violation of a constitutional right, protected by DC V Heller.\n\n&gt; It does not necessarily define what is reasonable, just, fair, appropriate, or best. If you want to argue what is inherently \"good\" or \"bad,\" you have to make a different sort of argument.\n\nCertainly, but that's not really the argument at hand here.  We can go down that road, but it's a long one, and I don't think I have time for that sort of debate right now.  I have engaged in that debate many times.  Since we probably won't agree on whether access to assault weapons is \"good\" or \"bad\", we'll just have to stick to legal constitutional arguments.\n\n&gt;Why should we assume that \"what the supreme court said\" automatically aligns with what \"should\" be the case?\n\nYou don't have to agree, but that doesn't mean you can change it or do anything about it.  You must accept people's rights whether you like them or not.  Kansas can't close their last abortion clinic, even though they desperately want to, because of Roe V Wade.  In the same way, NY can't enforce their SAFE act, even though they want to, because it violates the constitutional rights of their citizens.  That's why they will lose their court challenge on that law.\n\n&gt;Do you automatically support every single decision the Supreme Court makes? \n\nOf course not, but we can't infringe on the rights they interpret as being protected, even if we disagree.\n\n&gt;To put it another way, suppose the debate was over banning assault weapons with a constitutional amendment.   What the Supreme Court said about the 2nd amendment is irrelevant in that case, so you'll have to defend your preferred policy on its actual merits rather than just parroting the currently prevailing jurisprudential test.\n\nSure, legislators could put forth such an amendment, and it would be debated on it's merits.  If you are interested in debate on the merits of the assault weapon ban, the senate judiciary committee hearings on it were very interesting, and gave arguments on both sides.\n\nSuch an amendment would fail on it's merits, and the legislators who proposed and supported it would face difficult re-election campaigns.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1b46fm", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93jjs4", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364413438", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Doctor_Worm", "id": "t1_c93j8y2", "parent_id": "t1_c93iq14", "score": 6, "retrieved_on": 1431722471, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1b46fm", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93j8y2", "author_flair_text": "[PhD Student: Political Science][Center-Left]", "created_utc": "1364412671", "distinguished": null, "ups": 6}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c93iq14", "parent_id": "t1_c93hqls", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431722215, "controversiality": 1, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": 1370417358, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93iq14", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364411327", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Doctor_Worm", "id": "t1_c93hqls", "parent_id": "t3_1b46fm", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431721687, "controversiality": 1, "edited": 1364409432, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1b46fm", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93hqls", "author_flair_text": "[PhD Student: Political Science][Center-Left]", "created_utc": "1364408786", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "So an AR-15 is your go to home defense weapon?
