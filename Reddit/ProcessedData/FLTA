As a member of the [Democratic Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Democratic_Party), she served six terms in the [United States House of Representatives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives). In 2008, the [Green Party of the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_the_United_States) nominated McKinney for [President of the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States).

This is a common theme. Democrats offer a plan, the GOP offers a more conservative version of the plan, both sides deadlock and nothing passes. This happened in the 1970s, when Dems were pushing for single-payer and torpedoed Nixon's plan centered around price controls for treatments and medications. This happened in the early 90s, as described above. This happened with different iterations of the Patients Bill of Rights in the late 90's and early 2000's.

(Basically, the one who is shown to be most-favored overall by a weird mathematical process involving constructing dominance graphs.) The Schulze method is pretty darned good. For each candidate you give them a ranking. Two or more candidates can have the same ranking, and candidates can be left off (equivalent to giving them the lowest ranking). Alternatively, rather than rankings, it can be written with comparators (e.g. A &gt; B = C &gt; D). Then give the results to a computer **(trust me, you don't want to be doing this by hand)** and you'll get the winner. The primary issue I foresee with this method is that it's a hard sell because there's effectively no chance you'll be able to explain how it works.

Again, similar modifications can be made to meet any extraneous requirements.\n\nI would definitely not rely on this method because it is confusing and the villages are described as \"both poor and rural\".

The man, Nye Bevan, who was key in implementing the NHS was of the opinion that, for the richest and even the middle classes of society, there can surely be no greater feeling, no consumable object that can bring with it the same amount of good-will and social cohesion, then that of paying more tax to help those worse off.\n\nCritics of Obamacare, would you not agree with this? Helping others cannot be the provision of rich philanthropists, because in times of crisis the rich hoard and the poor suffer. A public health care system, which I might add, was largely based on a very Christian sentiment (in the U.K at least) must be free for all, paid by all that work. The big problem being that capitalism isn't very conducive to full employment.\n\nBear in mind when the NHS came about in the U.K, the socialist Labour government had provided near full employment, so thusly, it paid for itself. \n\nToday, however, I would say that since Thatcher, all governments have attempted to move the financing away from the public interest and into the private, very much to its detriment. \n\nIn specific reference to your question, I don't think that much can plausibly change? Americans don't like tax, if you don't pay more tax you get a health service very similar to what was in place before. As a Brit, I just don't see how Obamacare can represent a major change, without a major change in priorities more broadly; on tax, big government, intervention. \n\nI find it fascinating that so many Americans seem horrified by this proposal though, considering the religiosity of the country more broadly.

Doctors and hospitals have to accept one standard set of fixed prices. \n\nI think #3 is missing and it's a big concern with the ACA as it stands. The ACA is hoping that online market places, the mandate and limits on profit will automatically push market prices down but at least according to the documentary they seem to be suggesting that most countries, most notably Switzerland which seems to be the one that most closely matches the US, know prices will be kept in check because they explicitly set the prices at a fixed limit. \n\nAlso I don't think the documentary mentions it, but I'm not sure if employers are responsible for providing health care in any of these countries either.

For the purposes of this discussion, I'm limiting it to state-wide and higher elections as local elections often work somewhat differently.\n\nAs /u/urnbabyurn pointed out, it would be nearly impossible for a single person or even small group of people to push enough fake votes to actually sway an election. The actual amount of work required would be enormous and likely beyond the scale of a single person or small group. It would also require knowledge of the voter rolls themselves; who is eligible to vote but hasn't voted already and who won't vote. You can cast a provisional ballot under any name you want but those ballots have to be evaluated by the registrar's office before they're officially counted to be considered \"valid votes.\" You can fill out provisional ballots until your fingers fall off, if they're found to be fraudulent they won't ever make it into the final tally.\n\nAgain they could go in and fill out ballots under legitimate voter's names but again they'd have to know these names in advance and if that person had already voted or wasn't planing on showing up to vote. Which, barring omnipotence, would be impossible information to get.\n\nYou could have insiders rigging polls with a huge ring of people but this runs into the problem again that you'd need to fudge so many votes across such huge areas that you just couldn't do it unless you had massive cooperation among thousands of different people. It would depend on each one of those people remaining totally silent in a monumental conspiracy for ultimately no real gain (more on that later).\n\nIronically, the system being as fucked up as it is in a way saves it from this kind of fraud. The Presidential election is a prime example with the Electoral College. In elections where there are states or districts that are \"winner take all\" (if you get 51% of the vote, you win the vote(s) for that area) they're often heavily gerrymandered such that a particular party wins by a landslide pretty much regardless of who they put on the ticket. This means if you want to rig the election through voter fraud as the party not in power, you'd have to do exponentially more work just to catch up to the incumbent party. And a massive un-expected win in a normally other-party stronghold with wonky turnout numbers is virtually guaranteed to be investigated.\n\nThink of it like counterfeiting pennies. Yes, pennies are legal tender and counterfeiting them is illegal. However nobody does it because the benefit from doing so is exponentially less than the work you'll put into it and the risk you have to take to accomplish it that it isn't worth it.\n\nContinuing from above, election rigging isn't really a thing because there's no *need* to.\n\nFor starters, the parties can already legally do this. Gerrymandering is, essentially, legalized election rigging and it's rampant. CGP Grey made a great [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mky11UJb9AY) that explains this in greater detail.\n\nIt's also not needed because most political figures are going to vote the same way regardless of who they are. They'll fight over hot-button social issues that don't really mean much of anything but the vast majority will obey the wishes of the private interests that fund their campaigns and effectively put them into power. A company donating money to a super PAC doesn't care if the politician who gets elected is wearing a red tie or a blue one, so long as they repay that donation with favorable legislative decisions. This is why most companies that donate to [both](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/list.php) parties so they can curry favor with whoever wins the election.\n\nVoter fraud is not a problem and there is absolutely no evidence to indicate that it is.

This is wrong.\n\nI support \"Non-Strict\" voter ID laws because everyone gets to vote if they are eligible.\n\n*\"Strict vs. Non-Strict: In the \"strict\" states, a voter cannot cast a valid ballot without first presenting ID. Voters who are unable to show ID at the polls are given a provisional ballot. Those provisional ballots are kept separate from the regular ballots. If the voter returns to election officials within a short period of time after the election (generally a few days) and presents acceptable ID, the provisional ballot is counted. If the voter does not come back to show ID, that provisional ballot is never counted.\"*  http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx", "id": "t1_cdqnc48", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "RomanNumeralVI", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cdqflw2", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1428445905, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1rs1zc", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdqnc48", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1385866017", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdqfk4e", "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1428449582, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1rs1zc", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdqflw2", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1385845295", "ups": 4, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdqekvl", "score": -1, "retrieved_on": 1428449604, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1rs1zc", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdqfk4e", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1385845163", "ups": -1, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; *Your first sentence shows you have no idea about how voting registration works in the United States.

In fact, early in the nation's history, most states allowed non-citizens to vote.  (Ex: \"all men, having sufficient evidence of permanent common interest with, and attachment to, the community, have the right of suffrage.\" *Virginia Bill of Rights*, 1776).\n\nHowever, states started to limit the right of non-citizens to vote in the 1800s, and the last state that allowed non-citizens to vote was Arkansas up until 1926.  Today, **no state allows non-citizens to vote in state elections. In federal elections, it is a crime for a non-citizen to vote or to register to vote.** (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 611.

So, you asked if a state issued ID to a non-citizen would qualify.  The answer to that would be that *ID* would qualify, but the *person* would not.  The DMV notes whether the driver is a citizen when they issue a licence.  When the non-citizen submits that number, it will be cross referenced with the DMV database, as required by HAVA, and it will show that the person is not eligible and has committed four federal crimes.

Gov. Tom Corbett on June 30 signed a law for student tuition grants that are paid for by businesses that, in return, receive state tax credits.\n\nAna Puig, the FreedomWorks state director, said she put 34,000 miles on her car building public support for the grants. She visited tea party groups and anyone else who would listen, while also using conventional lobbying of legislators.\n\nAfter the fall elections, Puig said, FreedomWorks will push to raise the $50 million program cap to $100 million. The long-term goal is traditional tuition vouchers paid directly by state tax money. \"Change happens slowly,\" Puig said. \"We understand the value of incrementalism.\"*\n\n", "id": "t1_cdo5m1v", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Why does anyone care who runs the schools if they improve?

In June, a ballot measure to tax and regulate pot and legalize it for adult recreational use was certified. Organizers must now collect at least 30,169 valid signatures of registered Alaska voters by December 2013, which would ensure that the initiative receives a vote in the primary election on Aug. 19, 2014.\n\nPot has already been decriminalized and legalized for medical use in Alaska. A survey of Alaska voters taken earlier this year by Democratic-leaning Public Policy Polling found that 54 percent supported legalizing marijuana.\n\n**Arizona**\n\nIn June, marijuana legalization proponents began a campaign to gather the 259,213 signatures they'll need in order to get the issue on the 2014 ballot. The language of the proposed measure is rather expansive, and also includes a system of state taxation and regulation.\n\nMarijuana was legalized in the state for medical use in 2010 by ballot initiative. A poll taken earlier this year found that 56 percent of Arizonans supported legalizing some amount of cannabis.\n\n**California**\n\nA statewide initiative to legalize marijuana failed in California in 2010, but reformers are hoping to find success in 2014 and beyond. Earlier this month, organizers filed the California Hemp Act 2014, a measure that would legalize cannabis both in its standard and non-psychoactive forms. Beginning Oct. 1, the campaign will have 150 days to gather 750,000 valid signatures from California voters in order to get the issue on the 2014 ballot.\n\nMarijuana has already been decriminalized and legalized for medical use in California. A poll taken earlier this year found that 54 percent of Californians support legalizing pot.\n\n**Nevada**\n\nMarijuana advocates in Nevada have yet to mount a large-scale effort to get legalization on the ballot in an upcoming election, as most organizers in the state see 2016 as their best chance for a push. The liberal bent of the state makes it a popular target for reformers, however, and it's not yet clear whether Thursday's DOJ decision could increase desire for more immediate action.\n\nNevada has legalized medical marijuana, and earlier this year the state passed a measure establishing a dispensary system to help increase access for sick citizens. According to a recent poll, 56 percent of Nevadans would favor legalizing cannabis for recreational use if the money raised went to fund education.\n\n**Oregon**\n\nMedical marijuana legalization advocates in Oregon have already announced plans to campaign for an initiative to be placed on the ballot in 2014. An earlier legalization effort, which was poorly coordinated and widely mocked inside the state, failed in 2012. Organizers believe there is plenty of room for improvement.\n\nOregon has already decriminalized marijuana and legalized it for medical use. According to a poll taken in May, 57 percent of likely voters in Oregon support a proposal to tax, regulate and legalize marijuana for recreational use.\n\n**Maine**\n\nThe Marijuana Policy Project, a pro-pot advocacy group, has announced Maine as one of its top targets for legalization in upcoming election cycles. An initiative circulating through the state Legislature fell painfully short in a state House vote earlier this year, but MPP has announced plans to help coordinate a grassroots campaign to get a legalization measure on the ballot in 2016.\n\nMarijuana has been decriminalized and approved for medical use in Maine. According to a PPP poll released this week, 48 percent of registered voters in Maine believe pot should be legal for recreational use.\n\n**Massachusetts**\n\nThe deep-blue New England state is being eyed as a prime opportunity for legalization, with marijuana reform advocates pointing to high margins of support for previous pro-pot initiatives. No official campaign for a ballot initiative has been launched yet, though many predict it is only a matter of time.\n\nMassachusetts has decriminalized marijuana and just last November passed a ballot measure legalizing it for medical use. A February PPP poll found that 58 percent of the state's residents would be in favor of legalizing, taxing and regulating cannabis.\n\n**Montana**\n\nMontana has had a checkered history with marijuana laws. Voters passed an initiative legalizing cannabis for medical use in 2004, but opponents have since taken various steps to amend the measure or repeal it all together. Reform advocates remain hopeful that voters will support full legalization. They wasted no time following the 2012 election, filing a ballot question in hopes of putting the issue before voters in 2014.\n\nThere are no recent statewide surveys to gauge current support for pot legalization, though previous polls have showed a majority of Montana voters supporting the decriminalizing of marijuana.\n\n**Rhode Island**\n\nMarijuana advocates have high hopes that Rhode Island will be one of the first in the next round of states to legalize. This could come through a ballot initiative, but Rob Kampia, the executive director of MPP, recently said the issue could be ripe for state lawmakers to take on. While there's not yet a high-profile campaign to get legalization on an upcoming ballot, the state Legislature did consider a bill on the matter last session. While lawmakers debated the legislation and invited witnesses to testify on its merits, they never held a vote.\n\nRhode Island recently decriminalized marijuana and passed legalized medical marijuana around 2007. A PPP poll taken in January found that 52 percent of voters in the state support legalizing pot for recreational use.\n\n**Vermont**\n\nVermont has made strides to scale back marijuana prohibition over the past year, with a successful measure to decriminalize and a separate bill to establish a system of dispensaries for the state's medical cannabis patients. Observers see the state's strong support for the recent reelection of Gov. Peter Shumlin (D), an advocate for marijuana reform, as a sign that voters could get behind a ballot initiative to legalize. There is no large-scale effort toward this end yet, but a legalization bill was introduced in the state Legislature last session. It didn't receive a vote.\n\nPolls have consistently shown Vermonters to be supportive of efforts to scale back prohibition on marijuana.", "id": "t1_cdjjmve", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Xing_the_Rubicon", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1r4jdc", "id": "t1_cdjjn22", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cdjjmve", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428569504, "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdjjn22", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1385027102", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdjkcaz", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "lemontest", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cdjjmve", "score": 25, "retrieved_on": 1428569177, "controversiality": 0, "body": "You should credit [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/30/marijuana-legalization-states_n_3838866.html) for this list.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1r4jdc", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdjkcaz", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1385032110", "ups": 25, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1r4jdc", "selftext": "&gt; Massachusetts\n\nI live here.

Elizabeth Warren has garnered headlines by openly challenging Wall Street, challenging toothless regulators and confronting both republicans and democrats who have failed to protect the poor and middle class.  She is respectful to her Senate colleagues but is also vocal about the issues she champions, and as a member of the banking committee she has a very powerful position.  \n\nShe has been outspoken about the failure of regulation, the abuses of Wall Street, the minimum wage and the crippling debt of students and the poor.  The thinking is that without a war like Iraq to debate and with the ACA being law those financial issues are going to be central in the next election.\n\nShe throws heat, she's outspoken, she's been bold in committee calling out people that democrats usually treat with kid gloves.  She's well-liked in the senate, even as she's seen to be a bit unpredictable.  Women like her, though polls are scarce right now.\n\nAlternatively, she's only been in the senate for a year, and by the time a real campaign could kick off in 2015 she'd only have three years of legislative experience.  She's a junior senator in a very democratic state, she has no noteworthy body of accomplishment, no signature piece of legislation to champion, she won't even have much of a voting record to run on.  Hillary Clinton already has a huge superPac lined up and precinct captains all over the country waiting for her to announce.  Warren has no ground game in place, no experienced campaign staff, no fundraising apparatus in place.  These things can all be built, but she'd be at a disadvantage to someone like Hillary, who seems to have all the establishment support right now.  Politics is money, and Warren doesn't have any and she isn't sucking up to the big revenue generators.  There's time, but she'd be a huge long-shot.  Its likely that sometime during the primary season we'll get a look at a strong, compelling Democratic Governor who can get support from most of the left, and try to let the right divide itself.  That's what I meant in my last comment.  I like her, I like her outspoken style and I like her politics, but she's very much a long shot.  Very similar circumstances to Obama.  \n\nLastly, there's noise right now that she'd support a Hillary campaign, that the two have a mutual respect, and its possible Clinton-Warren could be a very interesting ticket.  Elizabeth Warren could be a very powerful and persuasive Vice Presidential candidate.", "id": "t1_cdg5j3w", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "lovesthebj", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1qsqg8", "id": "t1_cdg74hp", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "leon_everest", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdg8bls", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "unorignal_name", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1qsqg8", "id": "t1_cdgh341", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "TooTurnt", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdgi4kp", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "unorignal_name", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cdgh341", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428621903, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I disagree about Warren.

This will dramatically affect the primaries, because President Clinton played a large role jn establishing the very system that Warren wants to change. Inevitably, the more Warren is a part of the discussion around 2016, the more Hillary will be forced to address these issues and the progressive base will not be satisfied by her answers. \n\nThat being said, I don't even think Warren will run in the end, but she will shape the discussion. \n\nAs for a potential Hillary running-mate, I agree that right now it would seem likely she'll go for a governor that polls well among independents and moderates. Obviously from a swing state they could carry. Jay Nixon fits that description perfectly. His crossover voting in 2012 (i. e. people that voted for Romney and Nixon) was ridiculous, and his polling numbers are generally amazing. He balanced the budget several consecutive years, etc etc, got everything in this category going for him, and he could could help win a state that Romney won by like 17 points. Problem is, progressives will hate him. He's too blue dog. \n\nAlso, keep an eye on Martin O'Malley. He'll run, and he'll run way left of Hillary. \n\nEdit: So I was wrong.

Most agree she has a stirling intellect, that she was the driving force and political mind behind her husbands career.  She doesn't have military experience but certainly has an exceptional grasp of foreign policy matters due to heading the State Dept and she was her husband's closest counsel when he was president and commander in chief.  She has a multitude of Democratic allies and earned a lot of respect from senior Dems from her time as First Lady and her time spent as a Senator in New York.  She was known as an exceptionally hard working Junior Senator that was more than willing to work tirelessly on issues but to share or defer credit.  She has a complete understanding or Washington business and Washington politics.\n\nCons, she's incredibly polarizing.  Her presidency would be seen as an extension of the Bill Clinton era, and many would believe that he would wield undue influence in the White House.  She has no military experience and would face prejudice as the first female commander-in-chief.  The already intractable Republicans would become more adversarial, if that we're possible.  Her signature cause when she was First Lady was healthcare, and she made plenty of enemies in the 90s on that issue, including allegations she was dramatically overstepping her role as first lady and actually coordinating a health care task force.  She'd have to answer a lot of questions about the Whitewater Sandal, again, and she'd have to answer for a lot of the criminal prosecutions of former Clinton staffers and appointments.  She's seen as someone who prefers regulation but will side with business over the consumer, alienating some on the left.  She has a reputation for supporting causes that are politically popular or safe regardless of merit, and a conspicuous silence on matters that are more controversial, as well as a reputation for being ruthless and uncompromising to people who are not clear allies.  And her apparent ignorance of her husbands multiple affairs divides her among women.  Even after the humiliation of the Lewinski scandal her support of her husband was seen as political, a divorce not been seen as devastating to their political futures.  The fact that he runs his business out of Brooklyn and she's been travelling the world as Secretary of State suggests that they are married in name only, though things might have changed as they've aged.  Finally, Bill Clinton is at his best in small doses, as he tends to overwhelm any conversation and doesn't shy away from microphones or cameras.  It would be very difficult to keep his presence out of Washington and the media if she were President.\n\nSo, In my opinion she is very qualified, but extremely polarizing.  Her unfavourableness would've higher than anyone else running.  She is distrusted on the left and hated on the right.  An excellent politician and political mind, the very definition of a Washington insider, but one no Republican could ever be caught working with. She has a lot of dirt in her past, to contrast against her glowing resume, and if she tries to run on her husbands accomplishments she invites his scandals as well.  \n\nI don't know who the other democrats are that could run in 2016.  Obama was, forgive the pun, the dark horse early in his first primary.  You have to see who puts themselves out there, what their campaigns are, how they debate, they have to be vetted by the media before I'd try to guess who could win in 2016 or who would be a good president.

Unfortunately, it'll only be an upvote or two.~~ **Maybe this would be better as a separate submission actually so that this one doesn't get sidetracked.**\n\n[Done](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1qswi3/what_exactly_has_warren_done_that_has_earned_her/)", "id": "t1_cdg3y9u", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "FLTA", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I'll try to continue this dialogue, though I fear getting in over my head.  \n\n[This article](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115509/elizabeth-warren-hillary-clintons-nightmare) does an excellent job of detailing Elizabeth Warrens rise to prominence and her contrasts with Hillary Clinton. \n\nIn summary, there is a clear schism in the GOP between establishment republicans and the maverick Tea Party, but there is an emergent divide on the left between establishment Democrats who are close to business and the liberal wing of the party that defines themselves in the issue of income inequality.  Elizabeth Warren has garnered headlines by openly challenging Wall Street, challenging toothless regulators and confronting both republicans and democrats who have failed to protect the poor and middle class.  She is respectful to her Senate colleagues but is also vocal about the issues she champions, and as a member of the banking committee she has a very powerful position.  \n\nShe has been outspoken about the failure of regulation, the abuses of Wall Street, the minimum wage and the crippling debt of students and the poor.  The thinking is that without a war like Iraq to debate and with the ACA being law those financial issues are going to be central in the next election.\n\nShe throws heat, she's outspoken, she's been bold in committee calling out people that democrats usually treat with kid gloves.  She's well-liked in the senate, even as she's seen to be a bit unpredictable.  Women like her, though polls are scarce right now.\n\nAlternatively, she's only been in the senate for a year, and by the time a real campaign could kick off in 2015 she'd only have three years of legislative experience.  She's a junior senator in a very democratic state, she has no noteworthy body of accomplishment, no signature piece of legislation to champion, she won't even have much of a voting record to run on.  Hillary Clinton already has a huge superPac lined up and precinct captains all over the country waiting for her to announce.  Warren has no ground game in place, no experienced campaign staff, no fundraising apparatus in place.  These things can all be built, but she'd be at a disadvantage to someone like Hillary, who seems to have all the establishment support right now.  Politics is money, and Warren doesn't have any and she isn't sucking up to the big revenue generators.  There's time, but she'd be a huge long-shot.  Its likely that sometime during the primary season we'll get a look at a strong, compelling Democratic Governor who can get support from most of the left, and try to let the right divide itself.  That's what I meant in my last comment.  I like her, I like her outspoken style and I like her politics, but she's very much a long shot.  Very similar circumstances to Obama.  \n\nLastly, there's noise right now that she'd support a Hillary campaign, that the two have a mutual respect, and its possible Clinton-Warren could be a very interesting ticket.  Elizabeth Warren could be a very powerful and persuasive Vice Presidential candidate.", "id": "t1_cdg5j3w", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "lovesthebj", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1qsqg8", "id": "t1_cdg74hp", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "leon_everest", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdg8bls", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "unorignal_name", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1qsqg8", "id": "t1_cdgh341", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "TooTurnt", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdgi4kp", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "unorignal_name", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cdgh341", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428621903, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I disagree about Warren. I don't know if she'll run, but enough people are getting really excited by the hype around her thinking about it that she will play a role in shaping the debate during the primaries. Letting people speculate will bring a spotlight to her work in the Senate and thus more press coverage about her issues, namely holding the banks accountable and reforming the system. This will dramatically affect the primaries, because President Clinton played a large role jn establishing the very system that Warren wants to change. Inevitably, the more Warren is a part of the discussion around 2016, the more Hillary will be forced to address these issues and the progressive base will not be satisfied by her answers. \n\nThat being said, I don't even think Warren will run in the end, but she will shape the discussion. \n\nAs for a potential Hillary running-mate, I agree that right now it would seem likely she'll go for a governor that polls well among independents and moderates. Obviously from a swing state they could carry. Jay Nixon fits that description perfectly. His crossover voting in 2012 (i. e. people that voted for Romney and Nixon) was ridiculous, and his polling numbers are generally amazing. He balanced the budget several consecutive years, etc etc, got everything in this category going for him, and he could could help win a state that Romney won by like 17 points. Problem is, progressives will hate him. He's too blue dog. \n\nAlso, keep an eye on Martin O'Malley. He'll run, and he'll run way left of Hillary. \n\nEdit: So I was wrong.

I'm beat, but I'll try to address some of your points tomorrow.\n\nI'd caution, in the meantime, that I don't necessarily endorse the negative opinions or potential campaign challenges that a Clinton campaign might face, but tried to respond to OPs question fairly.  Hillary Clinton's popularity is far from universal, every potential candidate has strikes against them - there are *no* sure things in politics - and her last national campaign flamed out spectacularly and that was during a run against a democratic field intent on establishing themselves but trying very hard to follow the Reagan doctrine, thou shalt not speak ill of a fellow [Republican].  \n\nShe didn't get the beating from Republicans she'd get in a national campaign, because she's never been the nominee, and while I'm sure she's tough enough to take it, it would get very dirty.  It was only towards the end of their respective primary campaigns that they started to attack each other directly, and still maintained that they agreed on 95% of the Democratic platform, and asked voters to decide on the approach of the last 5%.  \n\nSuperPACs don't coordinate directly with campaigns, they can make ads that say *anything*, and they can afford a lot of them.  How much did we hear about Rev. Wright, Bill Ayers, and Weather Underground?  Christ, the Republicans managed to discredit a war hero in Kerry with \"Swift-boating\".  George Bush eliminated John McCain by painting him as an angry ex-pow intent on restarting the war in Vietnam.  I mean, they made Joe the Plumber a national celebrity.  Presidential campaigns are unspeakably ugly.  You really think her husband's impeachment proceedings and sex scandal won't be plastered on a thousand ads?  It's sex and politics.  Scandal and politics.  It'll be everywhere.  \n\nAnyway, I read your post and I'll reply more completely tomorrow.  All the best.\n", "id": "t1_cdg7s6d", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "lovesthebj", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdgd7a4", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1qsqg8", "selftext": "&gt;Presidents' \u201cdoctrines\u201d refer to a president\u2019s preferences in international relations\n\nThe Reagan Doctrine, or the Reagan Rule, or the \"Eleventh Commandment\" isn't a law or policy position, it was a campaign phrase that found popularity when Reagan ran for Governor of California.  \n\n**Thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican**\n\nIn the primary season candidates both want to win but there's an unwritten rule you can't beat your opponent up too badly, because anything you use during the primary season will be used by Republicans (we'll phrase this as if we're talking about the Democratic primary season) in the national election.  It does the party no good to attack your opponent so broadly that you do all the opposition's work for them, especially since opposition SuperPACs are already at work using ads to undermine candidates.\n\n&gt;Do you think Hillary hasn\u2019t seen dirty? [Summary of some Clinton Era Scandals] \n\nOf course she has, that's to her benefit but also her detriment.  Obama won on hope and change, partly because he wasn't a known quantity.  There are few people left that don't have an opinion on Hillary.  I'm not worried that *she* can't stand up to the mud slinging, she's tough as nails and extremely smart, but can her campaign be successful?  \n\n&gt;Also, it must be mentioned that Ken Star and the Republicans set up a $76 million apparatus completely dedicating to destroying Bill and Hillary, but we still had a balanced budget, peace, and overthrew a dictator in Haiti.\n\nWe did have a balanced budget, though Bill Clinton and the democrats take much, much more credit for that than they deserve.  We had an entirely new industry created out of absolutely nothing, it touched commerce, manufacturing, import/export, and its genesis was effectively local to the US.  The rise of the internet and the personal computer era is almost unprecedented in history, to have such a dominating market force arise out of almost nothing and to grow exponentially in such a short time.  Anyone who was president at the time was going to reap the benefit of the market growing so dramatically, and with the Gulf War ending before Clinton took office, the country was suddenly rich and getting richer.  \n\n&gt;It turned up that nothing was found concerning whitewater, just that Jim Mcdougal was a shady character.\n\nThat's a bit reductive.  A lot of people were criminally charged and at best lost their jobs and went broke defending themselves.  McDougal flipped on the Clintons to get a shorter prison sentence and still died in jail.  They couldn't make it stick to the Clintons, but a lot of people's lives were ruined.\n\n&gt;Even in those moments of that seemingly intractable situation, Hillary rises above with grace and dignity. My argument on this point is that we know EVEYTHING about Hillary already; she has been in the public eye since 1972. I will give you that Hillary\u2019s goal this time would be to define herself quickly and strongly, but that\u2019s what every presidential election is about.   [...]  The only people who are not aware of these issues or haven\u2019t had them hammered into her brain for years would be people in the 20s currently.\n\nYou're arguing from a position that I, or others, don't like Hillary.  This is false, I do like and respect her, though I think some of her positions are grandstanding and she's been silent on others of importance or only spoken out once the tide of popularity was clear.  \n\nYou also seem to want both sides of this part of the argument.  We know everything about Hillary/She needs to define herself/the past doesn't matter/it's never been successfully used against her.  I'd shade toward the former, and while she'll have a hand in framing the dialogue, her status as a known quantity didn't help her run against Obama.  She was seen as a cold, angry, business-as-usual Washington insider.  Could she shake that reputation if she ran again?  Only time will tell.\n\n&gt;And this isn\u2019t a Hillary problem, this is a running for president problem, everyone has it.\n\nVery true, but like I said above, I tried to answer OP's question fairly.  Your arguments seem to stem from the idea that she is a very electable candidate and that her scandals are long in the past.  I would agree, to an extent, but there's no easy road to the White House.  You seem to suggest she rises above her negatives, but this has hardly been the case.  Her name, alone, carries baggage.  I like her.  I like her as a person and as a candidate, but you can't ignore that Republicans hate her, that she espouses every position they would fight tooth and nail to defeat, that she would absolutely radicalize the right.  She's a pro-choice, pro gun-control, pro-healthcare, pro-gay rights liberal who will appoint liberal judges and political appointees, and *she's not even a particularly liberal person/politician!*  She's close to a moderate on most issues but she's still blindingly left to anyone on the right.\n\n&gt;But are people going to want to go back in the dumpster and pick out the trash that we were seeing 24 hours a day and reached some sort of consensus on in the 90s?\n\nI think it's foolish to think that they wouldn't when you consider how they attacked Kerry and McCain for Vietnam-era issues.  Before you think that there's a line too low for the Republicans to squeeze under to throw mud, remember that the Republicans and George Bush painted John McCain, a decorated war hero who was imprisoned in Vietnam while serving his country, as an angry, homicidal candidate intent on restarting the war in Vietnam to get revenge.  This really happened.  In our lifetime. \n\n&gt;All of the stories are old and used and the other Republicans have never even been fully vetted.  What if Christie likes to have sex with underage boys? We all know Rand Paul isn\u2019t a licensed ophthalmologist, but licensed himself, and Rubio is probably from outer space. \nWe know Hillary, she\u2019s a national name, she has been through the freak show and survived. We don\u2019t know anything about the other candidates AND they aren\u2019t national figures. Even Christie is going to have a very hard time making himself a national candidate.\n\nOPs question didn't have anything to do with the Republican candidates, and you're getting a bit silly at the end of too-long a debate.  I don't think Christie can survive the Republican primary season for the same reason Hillary will have a hard time, his kind of popularity can't stand up to the kind of scrutiny he'll receive as a national candidate.  But that's another discussion.", "id": "t1_cdgehkr", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "lovesthebj", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdggl71", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;Call it the \u201celeventh commandment,\u201d it\u2019s NOT the Reagan Doctrine.\n\nI'm probably going to call it whatever I want, and I took the time to quote the reference, twice.  It's been referred to as the Reagan Rule, the Eleventh Commandment and the Reagan Doctrine in media, and I took the time to highlight the applicable portion for context.  Debate, but don't be pedantic.\n\n&gt;Unwritten rule? There are many theories floating around that say candidates should use a primary to get all the worst press/ attacks out.\n\nThis has been the pattern lately, where candidates in primary campaigns have fought so hard against each other that they damage their chances on the main stage.  Obama and Hillary stayed clear of most of that, the most damaging things they lobbied at each other were the \"3am phone call\" campaign.  Meanwhile the Republicans were destroying each other until only McCain, who started out as a long-shot, was left.  And then they repeated this action in the last election where Republicans like Bachman and Perry tried to tear down Romney, and dragged the primary out for so long, that by the time the national campaign started he was already badly damaged and didn't have the support of the conservative right.  How many times did we hear 'I'll hold my nose and vote for Romney'?\n\n&gt;It seems as if you think it wouldn\u2019t be bad if Hillary were tied to the Clinton Era.\n\nI really couldn't say, it's a matter of spin.  I think everyone from the 90s takes way too much credit for the economic success, the same way current Republicans seem to deify Reagan.  It's a way to take credit for the good things and gloss over the bad.\n\n&gt;Of course I\u2019ve been reductive, but as it stands the Clintons came out clear and clean. Bring on whitewater.\n\nClear of charges, not necessarily clear and clean in reputation, but then how can you account for her significant unfavorable ratings 7 years ago?  How can you account for her losing to Obama?\n\n&gt;Perhaps it wasn\u2019t clear that I was referring to New York State polls? It seems as if you responded as if they were national polls, as you used a national figure to respond to my state figure. The idea was to show that the people in NY didn\u2019t necessarily like her, she wasn\u2019t from NY, she was seen as riding off her husbands coat tails, but when people saw her in action they liked her very much.\n\nThanks for clarifying your numbers.  Again, though, I don't think it's that hard to build a good reputation as a liberal in New York, and while any transplant candidate starts behind the 8 ball, she was elected - therefore succeeding in the only poll that matters - and worked hard.  I have no problem with her record in New York, but every candidate that runs for President is popular in their home state.  \n\n&gt;I\u2019m sure there are many feminists who would not take kindly to that remark. Why is it that men find it so difficult to talk about women\u2019s issues? Abortion?\n\nI strongly disagree.  If a feminist position or advocacy were considered controversial *that* would the insult to feminists, as if implying that a women's right or a family benefit was somehow an extraordinary outlier.  Women's rights are widely acknowledged, and any attack on women's rights is huge news.  Consider either Texas or the congressional recent panel of white, male, republicans who debated women's contraception, without a woman in the room.  These were huge stories that hurt the Republicans on the national stage.  Taking a position *against* women's reproductive health, women's right to choose, pay inequality, children's health, benefits and subsidies for families, etc, would **rightly** be controversial and draw ridicule and possibly alienate a large and powerful demographic.  It's much like gay marriage among democrats.  The safe position is now to support gay rights, and the unpopular opinion is to delay or deny those rights.  Feminists should rightly celebrate that women's rights are now the mainstream, and that advocating on their behalf is the safe, popular position, and attacking or withholding women's rights is the unpopular position.  Feminists win when their causes are seen as safe, unassailable and inviolate and when anyone seeks to deny them is seen as a bigot.\n\n[Consider recent Huffington/Fox News poll](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/polls/fox-17613)\n\nClinton 56/38, good numbers but less than 5 percent undecided.\n\nChris Christie 46/20, (and I think we agree, a very small chance of succeeding in the Republican party) but 21% never heard of and 13% undecided.  That's a lot of minds available to be changed and if they break roughly in half he's looking at 60/40, or similar to Hillary's numbers.\n\nHow many minds are available for her to change when she has such a low undecided return?  \n\nTo be clear, for I think the third time, I like her, I think she could win against a number of the potential Republican opponents and be a good President, even in her 70s, but I responded to OP's question fairly, and detailed what I think are her weaknesses.  I think if you were honest you'd have to acknowledge some of them too.  Somewhere, in a safe or a burn bag, there's an opposition prep report that the Clinton campaign had made in 2006 detailing all of her weakness, every old skeleton that the media or the Republicans would find and drag out on the national stage, and I'm sure that folder was much, much larger than my little post here.\n\nYour argument seems to be that her cons are either not applicable or are old news and therefore have no significance in an upcoming national election.  You've argued my points, but how do you respond to OP's original question.  What do you think are the cons (we know what your pro opinions are) of a Hillary campaign or Presidency?  How do you account for her loss to Obama?  How do you account for her still-high unfavorable ratings, years before she'd have to start building a campaign?  How do you account for her massive drops in popularity every time news comes out about Benghazi?

One of the things that the Democratic Party points out in the DFA and OFA trainings is that they have essentially used two campaign slogans going back to 1976, when the Dem Party had completely changed their primary process under the McGovern/ Fraser Commission. The readers digest version is that if a Democratic candidate comes after another Democratic president or a time of eceonomc prosperity then that candidate will run on continuation, and if the candidate was running against a CREEP (Campaign to Reelect the President,) then that candidate will run on change.

We know everything about Hillary/She needs to define herself/the past doesn't matter/it's never been successfully used against her.\n\nI\u2019m not wanting to have both sides of the argument, by saying that you seem to imply that there is already a general consensus concerning Hillary and her scandals. To be clear, I was saying that a consensus has already been reached on these subjects many years ago and she came out looking pretty clean. There could be a chance that people will try to bring up all the old bad blood, but she has the ability to define herself another way and win the argument. For example, she could take her new foundation, No Ceilings, and create a much larger name for herself as a women\u2019s rights leader. Then try talking to the stately women\u2019s rights leader about her husbands infidelity, the talking points write themselves. My larger point was that American presidential elections are about defining yourself and the other candidate. \n\n\n\n-I haven't seen any numbers for her that jumped that high in or around 2006, do you have a source? Most polls at that time had her favorable/unfavorable around 52-54/39-43\n\nPerhaps it wasn\u2019t clear that I was referring to New York State polls? It seems as if you responded as if they were national polls, as you used a national figure to respond to my state figure. The idea was to show that the people in NY didn\u2019t necessarily like her, she wasn\u2019t from NY, she was seen as riding off her husbands coat tails, but when people saw her in action they liked her very much. \n\n\n\n-Does that popularity continue into a national campaign?\n\nHer translating her current popularity into a national campaign is all on her right now. As I said, she has to have a good argument, she needs to start defining herself. \n\n\n\n-Frankly, they are safe issues. When has a politician fallen out of favor advocating on behalf of women, children, education and health?\n\nI\u2019m sure there are many feminists who would not take kindly to that remark. Why is it that men find it so difficult to talk about women\u2019s issues? Abortion?\n\n\n-Cheap? Absolutely. Will it alienate women voters? Potentially.\n\nThe Lewinski talk strengthens women\u2019s support for Hillary, just look at her national numbers after 1998, she got a huge boost. Many say that they agreed with her decision, or found that it was her own private decision not to be appraised, but as Maya Angelou said, \u201cI watched her show what it was like to be a woman in distress and difficulty. I watched her as she was on the front pages of every journal in the world. And I watched her stand.\u201d Most women agree with Dr. Angelou and would find an ad about Bill Clinton\u2019s infidelity to be repulsive and old news. Which, I just must add, if having a good marriage is a prerequisite for running for high office, there would have been many issues in the past/ present.  \n\n", "edited": 1384711698, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1qsqg8", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdggl71", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384711223", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdgd7a4", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428623601, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdgehkr", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384705554", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdg7s6d", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428624201, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Democratic field was trying to follow the Reagan Doctrine?

Hillary was all over journals around the world. It must be mentioned that Ken Star and the Republicans set up a $76 million apparatus completely dedicating to destroying Bill and Hillary, but we still had a balanced budget, peace, and over threw a dictator in Haiti. Whitewater was earlier mentioned. So, Ken had decided he wanted to nail Hillary on whitewater, because after all the freak show he had turned nothing else up. Hillary could have testified in the white house concerning whitewater, as did Bill testify in the white house concerning Lewinski, BUT they had to drag Hillary into a federal court building. I still remember the first question Ken asked her, \u201cMrs. Clinton, is there any other place you would rather be today?\u201d A huge smile came over Hillary\u2019s face and she said, \u201cOh! I can think of about a million other places.\u201d It turned up that nothing was found concerning whitewater, just that Jim Mcdougal was a shady character. Even in those moments of that seemingly intractable situation, Hillary rises above with grace and dignity.  My argument on this point is that we know EVEYTHING about Hillary already; she has been in the public eye since 1972. I will give you that Hillary\u2019s goal this time would be to define herself quickly and strongly, but that\u2019s what every presidential election is about. And this isn\u2019t a Hillary problem, this is a running for president problem, everyone has it. But are people going to want to go back in the dumpster and pick out the trash that we were seeing 24 hours a day and reached some sort of consensus on in the 90s? The only people who are not aware of these issues or haven\u2019t had them hammered into her brain for years would be people in the 20s currently. All of the stories are old and used and the other Republicans have never even been fully vetted. What if Christie likes to have sex with underage boys? We all know Rand Paul isn\u2019t a licensed ophthalmologist, but licensed himself, and Rubio is probably from outer space. We know Hillary, she\u2019s a national name, she has been through the freak show and survived. We don\u2019t know anything about the other candidates AND they aren\u2019t national figures. Even Christie is going to have a very hard time making himself a national candidate. \n\n\n\n", "edited": 1384705482, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1qsqg8", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdgd7a4", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384700897", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdg75y5", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428626914, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1qsqg8", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdg7s6d", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384669568", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdgd4rw", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cdg75y5", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428624233, "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1qsqg8", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdgd4rw", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384700593", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;Her approval ratings in the in 2000 were in the 30s, but by her re-election in 2006, her numbers were upwards of 70 %. And that\u2019s coming out of NY! \n\nI haven't seen any numbers for her that jumped that high in or around 2006, do you have a source?  Most polls at that time had her favorable/unfavorable around 52-54/39-43.  That unfavorable number is key, it's considered dangerous to try to run a national campaign if your unfavorable rating is higher than 40 unless your favorable number is much higher, and they hidden number is how many are undecided.  As you refer below, Hillary is very much a known quantity, very few people don't have a strong opinion of her.  Also, she got those numbers being a Senator in a very blue state, working with the most senior and possibly most powerful democrat in the Senate, during a time when the sitting President was becoming more and more unpopular.\n\nI agree that her numbers have gotten steadily higher since then, with the exception of losing the DNC primary which, considering she's only run one national campaign is really the only poll you need.  She wasn't a hypothetical candidate.  She ran and the Democrats chose someone else.  She's 0-1 on the national stage, and it wasn't for lack of trying.  Early in that primary season she was the presumptive nominee.\n\n&gt;Hillary\u2019s numbers are and have been stellar since 2006. So, I don\u2019t think any thinking person can deny her insane popularity or make the argument that she is polarizing because she was not popular in the 90s. Give me a break.\n\nHer numbers have been excellent since 2006, but that's partly because the legacy of former presidents improves as we get farther from it (Consider both the popularity of Reagan and Clinton now compared to the ends or low points of their Presidencies).  Also, there tends to be a strong statistical bump for former Secretaries of State.  Rice and Powell both enjoyed unprecedented popularity during and after their term at State.  Does that popularity continue into a national campaign?  Hard to say, I don't have a precedent at hand.  Part of that popularity stems from the fact that the State department takes no position on domestic issues, so you get the popularity of an important national position without being dragged down into the mud of daily politics.\n\n&gt;I do not understand how Hillary could be seen as an extension of the 90s Clinton era. \n\nI don't understand how you couldn't.\n\n&gt;Rosalynn Carter sat in on meetings with the chiefs of staff, Eleanor Roosevelt is obviously famous for her political involvement, Nancy Reagan was also involved in public debate and selection of her husband\u2019s advisors.  \n\nNone of those people, none, have ever run for national office after their husband left the White House.  I don't know how you could try to draw that comparison.  Every first lady since Jackie has had a national profile and cause celebre, but few were seen as the political force that got their husband elected and helped run his White House.  There's a reason that former Presidents are seldom seen weighing in on national issues.  They all retain a respectful privacy, not engaging in debate or undermining the current President.  In this case the former President would either be front and center on all issues or conspicuously absent, and Bill Clinton doesn't like being left out of the debate and he *really* doesn't like people attacking his wife.\n\n&gt;The partner of the president is a very strange, unelected position, which leaves the power of the position completely up to the individual. There will always be questions about the president\u2019s partner in a highly political environment.\n\nI agree, she would have to face those questions.\n\n&gt;Hillary was not in the military, but I\u2019m very curious as to why that would matter. Many presidents have not had \u201cmilitary experience.\u201d Hillary did, though, sit on the Armed Services committee when she was in the senate. That is not to mention the type of experience she would have gained being secretary of state.\n\nI agree, and I addressed this in another post below, and the American people are often willing to accept positions like State and key committee positions as executive experience relating to the military.  But unless she runs against someone with no war record or military experience the questions would absolutely come up, as they've come up in nearly every presidential election in recent memory.  The likelihood of her running against someone without a strong military history increases all the time, since Vietnam was too long ago and Iraq too recent, but it is almost always a campaign issue. \n\n&gt;Don\u2019t let the 90s distract you, Hillary\u2019s central issues all of her life have been women and girls. Do you not remember the \u201cit takes a village\u201d speech from the 1996 DNC? Not to mention the work with the children\u2019s defense fund, etc.\n\nI agree, I don't think I ever questioned her commitment to women's groups and family.  I read It Takes a Village and very much enjoyed it.\n\n&gt;People are tired of the same old political gags. \n\nThis is absolutely not true, and I'd ask you to support that proposition.  People say they are tired of those gags, but when you see the kind of bullshit that makes it's way into national politics you realize people eat that shit up.  Obama and drugs, the birther movement, the Tea Party holding government hostage, Anthony Weiner and Elliot Spitzer.  The American people say they have little tolerance for these things and then viewership and readership go through the roof.  \n\n&gt;The only reasons we ever talked about Vince Foster or whitewater was because republicans could not defeat Bill politically, so they tried to defeat him personally and Ken Star was running dry on Lewinski.\n\nThat's a bit of shuffling of the chronology.  The Whitewater controversy was an issue in 1992 and came to prominence in Bill Clinton's first campaign and term (in an era before the kind of internet we have now, and before the 24-hr news cycle), Filegate was in 1996, and the Lewinsky scandal was 1998.  I agree Ken Starr tried to dig up skeletons in an ill-advised attempt to extend his prosecution of the Clintons, but those scandals predated Lewinsky.\n\n&gt;Hillary hasn\u2019t stood up for difficult issues? I hope that it doesn\u2019t imply that women, children, education, and healthcare are safe issues. It\u2019s sort of like when old southern men call those issues, \u201cfemale/ soft issues.\u201d\n\nFrankly, they are safe issues.  When has a politician fallen out of favor advocating on behalf of women, children, education and health?  Those issues are universal, they are unimpeachable except when arguing about funding and privacy, and anyone who attacks you on those issues risks alienating key demographics.  Advocating for families is probably the most 'safe' position you can take.  \n\n&gt;I\u2019m sorry, but in 2013 it is very cheap to use Lewinski. [...] I think bringing up Bill\u2019s infidelity and her choice not to divorce him might upset a lot of women voters, just saying.\n\nCheap?  Absolutely.  Will it alienate women voters?  Potentially.  Though if Hillary's numbers stayed as strong with women as they are now there might not be an undecided women left.  If she took 75% of women the way Obama overwhelmingly carried blacks, and the remaining 25% of women were firm Republican that already thought of her unfavorably, painting her with scandal might not move the needle among women and might draw out more Republican men and family values minorities like Latinos.  Hard to say, the RNC would run a thousand polls before getting dirty in those areas, but the Heritage Foundation or the Koch brothers?  With their own money and their own axe to grind and who absolutely hate Bill Clinton and would love to see him torn down?  I think it's naive to think it wouldn't come up considering the players involved.\n", "id": "t1_cdgdyuk", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "lovesthebj", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cdg75y5", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428623844, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1qsqg8", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdgdyuk", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384703826", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdg374x", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428627202, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I must address the cons here.

Pretty much everyone knew at the time that passing that particular bill was near-certain to lead to an invasion, and the Senate dismissed any attempts to amend it to turn it into what people like Kerry might've liked later to claim that it was.\n\nBut when we got as far as *2007*, when the mistake was so obviously clear, and Hillary Clinton was running for president and *still* refused to call it the mistake that it clearly was, it got a bit clearer that she actually supported the war.  And she went further than that: She outright told an audience at a large public event that if we wanted a candidate who thought that vote had been wrong, she wasn't the one.  We who wanted that could go find other candidates.\n\nSo we did.  We found one who had gone out of his way to rail against this war and this vote from the start, even though he didn't need to.  He could've stayed out of it, or made vague ambiguous statements open to interpretation later, but he stuck his reputation on the line on what seemed like an unpopular position at the time, and he kept at it consistently in the years since.\n\nWhatever Hillary Clinton really thought and believed in her heart of hearts isn't the point.  I think she was a full-on supporter of the Iraq invasion.  You may think otherwise.  It's debatable and unprovable either way.  Whatever Obama may really believe is also not quite the point.\n\nThe point is that we know, without any doubt, that Hillary Clinton's support for the Iraq war and Obama's early and crystal-clear opposition to it, was **the** reason Obama got his opening to edge her out for the nomination.

In that way, she is fulfilling her mandate in a way that we could only hope all of our political class would do. \n\nBut as far as her rhetoric is concerned in general, however fiery or tame it may be, it's immaterial since I make a point of avoiding all but basic transcripts and only rarely watch speeches live. This too, to my mind works to whether I find her popular on Reddit, here again , that does not weight with me to terribly much.\n\nI think it speaks volumes on the extent to which the rest of the US political process is compromised by corporate interests that are usually directly counter to the interests of the largest number of the citizenry. \n\nIn this way, she is the black swan in company with a rarefied few others. \n\nAs far as \"what has she done\", I would present \"All Your Worth\" a book she wrote with her daughter - years before running for office, that is a very straightforward, non-partisan way of managing money, and doing so in a no-bullshit way.\n\nIn this respect, even years and years ago, she was working her craft, helping people mitigate predatory lenders and avoid the rat-trap that is the banking and mortgage system, where lenders will almost invariably tell you what they want to hear, having long ago discarded fiduciary responsibility. \n\nSo today, bankers chastize Sen. Warren for promoting the idea that pay-day loans are predatory. Well, fact of the matter is , they are - if a poor person can't afford to pay 50$ this week, it's decidedly difficult to see how easily they will be able to pay 60$ at 300% interest next week.\n\nAnyone who has applied for a mortgage knows full and well, they will be approved for some absurd amount of \"house\" relative to their income.\n\nAccording to various corporate interests, she is a communist stooge and possibly the antichrist - for suggesting people should obtain mortgages well and truely in the neighborhood of 1/3 of their net disposable income.\n\nIn that way, it's just that simple, she's helping people navigate financial life and parse some of the complexities and is regularly vilified for that. In perfect fairness overstretching the consumer credit, forcing consumers to borrow into credit cards and other high-interest financial instruments and then \"helping\" consumers pick up the pieces is a HUGELY profitable industry, and according to executives at MBNA (a huge credit card conglomerate) it was one of the major ways they were profitable at all. This is both a positive from a voter's perspective, and a negative, in that where-ever she goes, you can rest assured that corporate interests will rail against her existence.\n\nIn that respect,having known about her from her academic career and seen a decades-long consistency in her stance and staunch point of being vastly well informed on the public policy positions she does stake out, whatever else \"cons\" are, provided they are not in the public arena, she has my vote. \n\nAs far as my personal political leanings, while I may not be so progressive/liberal as many others on this site, I'm afraid my political affiliation is most akin to a part of the Republican party that was snuffed 20 years ago, in preference for abject neoconservatism and corporatism.", "edited": 1384716604, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1qswi3", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdgi4sq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384714762", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "stickied": false, "title": "What exactly has Warren done that has earned her such a following on Reddit?

Therefore, a major reason you never see much of a push towards that kind of change is because most political activists recognize the futility of devoting massive amounts of time, funding, and political favor towards changing the constitution.\n\nThis is why I was saying that it should focus on the state level rather than going straight to the national level.

Internet ads.

With a simple FAQ and sample election. Literally, sample elections or even 'do-over' elections from the past with the Approval Voting system. Maybe. A 2000 Do-Over may end up causing more harm than good.\n\nStep 2: Run local ads \"Tired of lesser-of-two-evils\" or \"Want more freedom in your elections?\" depending on the local character.\n\nStep 3a: Phone polls, with approval voting. \"Given the current list of candidates, which ones would you vote for? Select as many as you wish.\" \"Would you like a voting system that allows to vote for every candidate you like?\"\n\nStep 3b: Local ads explaining approval voting, and directing people to the website.\n\nStep 4: Local ads touting approval voting based on 3a and the actual results of elections.    \nDistricts with highly approved winner, highlight that it shows that person's approval.     \nDistricts with 'best available' winner, highlight that it shows there are other competitive candidates not available in the current system.     \nConservative districts, highlight democratic congresspersons that would have lost if the approval voting existed.     \nLiberal districts, same but against conservative congresspersons.      \nIndependent/purple districts, highlight districts with non-major-party players that would have won if not for the current system.\n\nStep 5: Post-election Approval Voting. Send out ballots (clearly marked as not official) as almost a do-over for the recent election. Especially for contentious elections. Tally the numbers. Make everything upfront and honest, especially with the numbers. (20% responded with these results ..., etc).\n\nStep 6: More ads, highlighting everything. The good. The bad. The ugly. Compare and contrast with the current system. Show the faults of the current system. Show the faults of Approval Voting. \"Tell you representative, whether you approve of them or not, what you think.\" Etc.\n\nStep 7: Change everything.

Look at Romney, he had to go extreme right and spend all of his money just to win a primary, and couldn't get away from that when the real election came.\nLet's say that they lose the next national election, and the one after that. Not unreasonable, if they have to go througb the same process next time when dems could easily go clinton if no other options arise. A Hillary ticket would be hard to beat for republicans.\nSo they lose, and lose again. I feel at this point they'll be in a position of incredible weakness, which creates room for change. This isn't the only way to go about a new party, but its a not unreasonable scenario. Anyways.\nSo let's introduce change into the system. Its a new millennium, we have a society with capabilities and abilities never before equalled. I mean come on, we're the United States of America. We split the atom and went to the moon, and built the biggest and best economy the world has ever seen. Talk about China all you want, they're half our size, slowing down, and alot of cracks are starting to show. When we did we stop doing cool things? When did we stop making society better?\nI want to grab government by the top and shake it out. I want to make it efficient. We all assume it has to be some horrible red tape nightmare, but why? What in its nature means it has to do that?\nI believe that government should have limited direct involvement with citizens. I don't care who you worship. I don't care how you dress or who you marry. Government should stay out of the bedroom.\nWe should be building another American century. Lets fund science and education, find things that give quick growth to the economy and build new industries.\nLets go to space. Back in the 80s, the cbo did a report on economic growth from investment in the moon program. For every dollar invested, the economy grew by ten. And that doesn't include industries that began as an effect of the program. Everything from computers to sunglasses were improved or built for Apollo. I'm just saying, you want to improve the economy, bam, right there.\nLets update the American infrastructure for a new century. Faster trains, better roads, anything that can further improve our infrastructure should be taken into consideration. We lost our drive to build big things, lets get it back. Pharohs built pyramids with nothing but people power, what can we do?\nI believe that we can do anything we set our minds to. We just need to get up and do something. I think both current parties have some good ideas, and there's no reason we can't take what we want and do something new with the rest. Why is it only left and right? We all know there are obvious things we can do for improvement, but we just don't. I say we start electing people and doing real good for our country. Thats what democracy is, you can do that.

Hence while party leaders often have only a narrow field of policy preferences, the party rank-and-file provide innumerable avenues by which an interest group can influence the policy process. In summary, the two-party system isn't a homogenizing, exclusive, and closed to interest groups of middling influence as it outwardly appears.\n\nReplacing first-past-the-post voting to open the field for third parties in effect replaces two known variables with a host of unknown ones that will ultimately only serve a similar function. From the perspective of influence-wielding interest groups, the short-run consequences of such a move would merely be incredible disruption as officials with whom they already enjoy access and relationships are thrown out or forced to reevaluate their positions in the face of newly credible challengers. \n\nThird parties can't effect change because of what little access to the policymaking process they have.
