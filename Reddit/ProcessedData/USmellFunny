By providing funds and weapons to rebel groups, they make a clear statement of being against the current regime, though not necessarily in favor of the rebels themselves.\n\nThe only thing NATO is guilty of is being in support of anti-tyrannical movements that have, overtime, developed ties with terrorist groups.

In today's times, with mushrooming bureaucracy, increased complexity of legislation, and legislation becoming more and more technical and arcane it is impossible for a legislator to be properly informed on the legislation that they vote on. This is why legislators have staffers and lobbyists to help them out. Lobbyists merely inform legislators, though there can be problems with bias.\n\nIt's important to note that lobbyism isn't the problem, lobbyism is critical for organizations and individuals to be able to voice their concerns and directly communicate with their representatives. But the problem is that large businesses control much of the lobbyism process, which crowds out public interest groups. How big of a problem is this? Business lobbies outnumber public interest (environment, citizen, union) lobbies on a 16:1 ratio. Additionally, business lobbies make up over 75% of all lobbying spending. \n\nI think the best solution to this along with drastically improving the efficiency of government is to \n\n1. Provide pay increase to congressional staffers\n2. Hire many more staffers.\n3. Fund congressional offices\n\nThis solves lobbyism in three ways.\n\nFirst, it directly reduces the number of lobbyists. Around 90% of congressional staffers leave their jobs and eventually become lobbyists. More than half quit within three years. This means remaining staffers are overworked and have to work 80-100 hour work weeks. They are also only paid $30,000 a year, compared to a multiple hundred thousand dollar salary available at a lobbying firm. Thirty thousand dollars is compared to congressional parking-lot attendees who make $49,000 a year. \n\nOver the years less and less money has been allocated to the staffers while bureaucracy has mushroomed, dramatically increasing the workload of these staffers.\n\nBecause of poor job quality, congressional staffers are by-and-large 24 year old college grads with no prior job experience and have little outside knowledge, which when compared to a lobbyist who has decades of experience with a specific industry or sector, no wonder politicians rely on lobbyists. This leads to\n\nSecond, it indirectly reduces the number of lobbyists. More staffers means congressmen need less lobbyists to fill their positions. Higher wage means these staffers will stay more frequently, allowing their experience to go on par with lobbyists.\n\nThirdly, it allows unregistered and illegal lobbyists to be prosecuted. The DoJ has referred over 2000 cases of unregistered lobbyists to the Clerk of the House, but because of the staffing crisis, they simply weren't able to prosecute any of these individuals. The Brookings Institute estimates that ~9% of lobbyists are improperly registered. Basically there are just so many high-stress jobs that these staffers have to do and they physically cant with their resources.\n\nWhat do staffers mean? Positions like congressional aides and assistants. More people to work in places like the Congressional Research Service or the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nI think this is the most important solution to lobbyism.

Congressperson much constantly seek lobbyist so as to have enough fund to win the election cycle and in particular have a war chest large enough to fight any potential smear campaign. Congresspersons spend an enormous amount of their time, I think something like 70%+, fundraising. Additionally congresspersons can be coerced into voting or not voting on a bill out of fear of being the target of a smear campaign. \n\nSo while I'm not arguing against your proposals, and indeed they really do solve some problems, the core issue \"threatening our democracy\" would be to reform campaign financing. Not only limiting how much and from where a politician can bring in money (directly and indirectly). But indeed limiting how much money can spent for political purposes during an election cycle/campaign. Of course it is easier said than done. While it may feel good to say campaigns can only be public financed and to block all third party advertising, it would also to a very real extent suppress the ability for the public to participate in the political process. \n\nSources for the campaign finance stuff I brought up:\n\nhttp://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/461/take-the-money-and-run-for-office\n\nhttp://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/01/27/145923803/the-friday-podcast-a-former-lobbyist-tells-all", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Scaryclouds", "id": "t1_c9mx2xe", "parent_id": "t1_c9lwvfk", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431423891, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1d189p", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9mx2xe", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366952597", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "How about simply reduce the scope of government?

Romney on multiple occasions called Russia our \"#1 geopolitical foe\" and spoke about trying to be tougher with Russia.  The impact of this rhetoric probably wouldn't have been as large as it sounds, but it certainly would have increased tensions between the two countries moreso than with Obama in office.\n\nThe differences between the two candidates were largely of rhetoric rather than significant intended substance.
