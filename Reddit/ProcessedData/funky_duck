An Amendment can be proposed one of two ways. Both ways have two steps. It can be proposed by Congress, and ratified by the states. Or on demand of two-thirds of the state legislatures, Congress could call an Article V Convention to propose an amendment, or amendments, which would only be valid if ratified by a vote of three-fourths of the states.\n\n&gt;To date, all amendments, whether ratified or not, have been proposed by a two-thirds vote in each house of Congress. Over 10,000 constitutional amendments have been introduced in Congress since 1789; during the last several decades, between 100 and 200 have been offered in a typical congressional year. Most of these ideas never leave Congressional committee, and of those reported to the floor for a vote, far fewer get proposed by Congress to the states for ratification.\n\n&gt;In the first step, the proposed Amendment must be supported by two-thirds in Congress, both House and Senate. The second step requires a three-fourths majority of the states ratifying the amendment. Congress determines whether the state legislatures or special state conventions ratify the amendment.\n\n&gt;On attaining Constitutional ratification of the proposal by three-fourths of the states, at that instant, the \"fundamental law\" is expressed in that Amendment. It is operative without any additional agency.

But it helps in proportion to your ability to influence their election.  One call from a normal constituent won't have a noticeable impact, but calls from thousands of constituents can.  The problem is that if *everyone* gives up without trying because they think \"my lone voice won't matter\", then they're already defeated.\n\n2) A vote for a third party is *not* (necessarily) a vote against your interests.  I know that's a popular message in the public political discourse, but it's really an oversimplified and somewhat garbled interpretation of a legitimate principle of political science.  Single-representative districts and first-past-the-post voting in the United States do skew election outcomes and favor a two-party system, but it's not an iron lock and it only truly favors two candidates *per district*, not two parties throughout the whole nation.  Keep in mind that US elections have *always* operated by these rules, and there have been many successful third parties and independent candidates.  Your vote is the most direct influence you can have on an election, short of running yourself, and if you don't vote for the candidates you believe in then you're contributing to the election of candidates you don't like.  So my advice is don't worry about the strategic voting: if you find a candidate or a party which shares your belief much better than one of the big brands, *vote for them*.  And give the finger to anyone who complains that you ruined the election for someone else; if they wanted your vote, they should have earned it from you.\n\nOkay, as to your first question: **How do we stand up for ourselves?**\n\nThe answer to this, in its simplest forms, will probably not be much comfort, but it's critical for everyone to realize that it's the only truth out there: earning the respect and consideration of the government requires **a lot of hard work.**  There's just no way around it.  The beauty of democracy is that people can influence public policy by non-violent means, but they still have to *fight* for their beliefs just as much as anyone in a dictatorship must in order to be heard.\n\nMany people like to focus on the amount of money that lobbyists for corporate and special interest groups sling around to try to buy influence with politicians.  And while that's part of the story, it's *only* part of it.  Lobbyists also do a *shit ton* of work to get the laws and policies they want.  They talk to politicians, government staffers, other private VIPs, to the media, and to the public, building up friendships and professional relationships to make sure they always have an opportunity to, at the very least, make their case and have it seriously considered.  As a private citizen, a person might complain that he can't approach the scale of campaign donations that interest groups can toss around, but if he's not willing to put forth even the same sort of *effort* as those interest groups' representatives, then the money is just icing on the cake of his failure.\n\nIf you believe in a cause, if you seriously want to make a difference with government policy, then you *cannot* leave it to other people to make the difference for you.  Other people can *help* you, in fact you'll need them to be successful, but you have to take personal responsibility for promoting your own beliefs.  Communicate your beliefs to your representatives so that they actually know what you care about, and never let them forget.  Stay informed about your issues and government actions upon them, when your representatives do something relevant make sure you let them know you're watching.  Talk to *everyone* you know, and your acquaintances to make sure they understand why something is important to you, and why it should be important to them.  Convince them to take the same sorts of actions you are, by communicating with representatives and staying informed.  \n\nA lot of people don't like talking politics, and that's a major obstacle for all of us, but *those people and their apathy are the problem with the system*.  Politicians have been mocking the great uneducated, apathetic masses since time immemorial; treating them as children who don't know what's best for themselves if they even have opinions at all.  Too often we *let them do it*.  If you really want to get anything done, then \"I don't care about politics\" is not an acceptable answer.  It's tough to thread the needle of respecting a person while changing their minds, but the challenge does not make it any less essential: again, politics is hard work.\n\nIf there's an organization dedicated to your cause, join it and support it.  If there's not, or the ones that exist are incompetent, *build one yourself*.  If there are no politicians who actually represent your views the way you want, then run for office yourself, or find someone who you think would do a better job and convince *them* to run.  We such open access to ballots in our system for a reason, take advantage of it.\n\nWe hear exhortations like \"get organized!\" and \"make your voice heard!\" so often that they can seem like simple platitudes.  But we're sabotaging our political influence when we forget the underlying truths of those statements.  Organization and communication aren't just *one* way to stand up, they're pretty much the *only* way.  If you're not dedicated to your cause, you'll be outlasted by people who are.  If you don't take action in support of your cause, no one will even know you believed in anything in the first place.\n\nIt's possible, even if you do everything I've described, that you can still fail.  Sometimes a message doesn't resonate with enough people, or the other side simply does it *better*.  But if you put in that effort and fail, then you at least can't be blamed for lack of trying.  I see to many public causes that fizzle simply because the supporters can't be bothered to *do* anything.  Politics is hard work, but if you have enough respect for yourself and your beliefs, you won't let that stop you from doing it anyway.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "techz7", "id": "t1_c9ndyqw", "parent_id": "t1_c9ndcop", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431415794, "controversiality": 0, "body": "You are right, me myself I don't know enough about the political sphere and I do need to educate myself which is partially what I was attempting here.

The problem is that if *everyone* gives up without trying because they think \"my lone voice won't matter\", then they're already defeated.\n\n2) A vote for a third party is *not* (necessarily) a vote against your interests.  I know that's a popular message in the public political discourse, but it's really an oversimplified and somewhat garbled interpretation of a legitimate principle of political science.  Single-representative districts and first-past-the-post voting in the United States do skew election outcomes and favor a two-party system, but it's not an iron lock and it only truly favors two candidates *per district*, not two parties throughout the whole nation.  Keep in mind that US elections have *always* operated by these rules, and there have been many successful third parties and independent candidates.  Your vote is the most direct influence you can have on an election, short of running yourself, and if you don't vote for the candidates you believe in then you're contributing to the election of candidates you don't like.  So my advice is don't worry about the strategic voting: if you find a candidate or a party which shares your belief much better than one of the big brands, *vote for them*.  And give the finger to anyone who complains that you ruined the election for someone else; if they wanted your vote, they should have earned it from you.\n\nOkay, as to your first question: **How do we stand up for ourselves?**\n\nThe answer to this, in its simplest forms, will probably not be much comfort, but it's critical for everyone to realize that it's the only truth out there: earning the respect and consideration of the government requires **a lot of hard work.**  There's just no way around it.  The beauty of democracy is that people can influence public policy by non-violent means, but they still have to *fight* for their beliefs just as much as anyone in a dictatorship must in order to be heard.\n\nMany people like to focus on the amount of money that lobbyists for corporate and special interest groups sling around to try to buy influence with politicians.  And while that's part of the story, it's *only* part of it.  Lobbyists also do a *shit ton* of work to get the laws and policies they want.  They talk to politicians, government staffers, other private VIPs, to the media, and to the public, building up friendships and professional relationships to make sure they always have an opportunity to, at the very least, make their case and have it seriously considered.  As a private citizen, a person might complain that he can't approach the scale of campaign donations that interest groups can toss around, but if he's not willing to put forth even the same sort of *effort* as those interest groups' representatives, then the money is just icing on the cake of his failure.\n\nIf you believe in a cause, if you seriously want to make a difference with government policy, then you *cannot* leave it to other people to make the difference for you.  Other people can *help* you, in fact you'll need them to be successful, but you have to take personal responsibility for promoting your own beliefs.  Communicate your beliefs to your representatives so that they actually know what you care about, and never let them forget.  Stay informed about your issues and government actions upon them, when your representatives do something relevant make sure you let them know you're watching.  Talk to *everyone* you know, and your acquaintances to make sure they understand why something is important to you, and why it should be important to them.  Convince them to take the same sorts of actions you are, by communicating with representatives and staying informed.  \n\nA lot of people don't like talking politics, and that's a major obstacle for all of us, but *those people and their apathy are the problem with the system*.  Politicians have been mocking the great uneducated, apathetic masses since time immemorial; treating them as children who don't know what's best for themselves if they even have opinions at all.  Too often we *let them do it*.  If you really want to get anything done, then \"I don't care about politics\" is not an acceptable answer.  It's tough to thread the needle of respecting a person while changing their minds, but the challenge does not make it any less essential: again, politics is hard work.\n\nIf there's an organization dedicated to your cause, join it and support it.  If there's not, or the ones that exist are incompetent, *build one yourself*.  If there are no politicians who actually represent your views the way you want, then run for office yourself, or find someone who you think would do a better job and convince *them* to run.  We such open access to ballots in our system for a reason, take advantage of it.\n\nWe hear exhortations like \"get organized!\" and \"make your voice heard!\" so often that they can seem like simple platitudes.  But we're sabotaging our political influence when we forget the underlying truths of those statements.  Organization and communication aren't just *one* way to stand up, they're pretty much the *only* way.  If you're not dedicated to your cause, you'll be outlasted by people who are.  If you don't take action in support of your cause, no one will even know you believed in anything in the first place.\n\nIt's possible, even if you do everything I've described, that you can still fail.  Sometimes a message doesn't resonate with enough people, or the other side simply does it *better*.  But if you put in that effort and fail, then you at least can't be blamed for lack of trying.  I see to many public causes that fizzle simply because the supporters can't be bothered to *do* anything.  Politics is hard work, but if you have enough respect for yourself and your beliefs, you won't let that stop you from doing it anyway.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "techz7", "id": "t1_c9ndyqw", "parent_id": "t1_c9ndcop", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431415794, "controversiality": 0, "body": "You are right, me myself I don't know enough about the political sphere and I do need to educate myself which is partially what I was attempting here.

For example, Manufacturing, Railroads and Chemicals support it. Museums and Pro-Business Associations oppose it. This involves a large degree and uncertainty, because most corporations and individuals are basically indifferent to the faith of the CISPA, but that's not even the problem.\n\nHere's how they aggregate employers in two different camps:\nhttp://maplight.org/us-congress/bill/113-hr-624/1116571/total-contributions\n\nThen they aggregate individual campaign contributions plus PACs contributions by employer and come to these numbers. \n\nFor example, let's pick the Congressman most staunchly and vocally opposed to this bill, Justin Amash.\n\nHe got $122,100 in contributions from pro-CISPA groups and $0 from anti-CISPA groups.\n\nIf you're a bank clerk (or a train machinist, or a tech, or a trader, or a pharmacist, or pretty much every job in the economy) who hates CISPA and you donated to Amash because you agree with his positions on this type of issues, your contribution is listed here as \"pro-CISPA\". Does this make sense?\n\nAll this proves is that the large majority of the people who donated to congressional political campaigns from July 1, 2010 \u2013 June 30, 2012 work in \"economic sectors\" that Maplights classified as pro-CISPA. But to suggest these contributions are tied to CISPA is, at best, spurious. Truly, it's nonsensical.\n\nThe same for the lobbying expenditures - not that those have nothing to do with contributions to politicians. Lobbyists influence politicians by persuasion, writing papers or talking to them, they can't give them money. It's impossible to say how much of that money went to lobbying focused on influencing votes on the CISPA bill. But the way the article is written it seems that the  $162,800,000 spent in lobbying expenditures by the Chamber of Commerce served that purpose. If the CoC spent money on the CISPA, and I'm not even sure they actually spent any, it was a minuscule percentage of that money.

The US has a set level of tanks/planes/soldiers etc it feels it wants.  This means there is a base-line to the spending that needs to be maintained.  This level may be higher or lower than various people want, but there is a minimum that we have decided to spend as a nation.\n\n2) Defense contractors make a lot of jobs.  Defense contracts mean that all (or nearly) of military items are made in the US.  They are also known to spread out various parts of the manufacturing process to different districts and states. If one politician wants to be close down a factory that makes tanks then he has to close down the factory that makes the raw steel, the barrels, the treads, the engines, the bolts, etc.  All of those components might be in different states, meaning you need a lot of people to agree.\n\n3) What do you do with the now idle people?  I am not talking about the hands-on factory people.  I mean the scientists and engineers who design and test our weapons.  If you cut back on Boeing's fighter jet division you have a lot of technical knowledge out on the market.  You know who might pay well for some experienced jet designers?  China, Russia, etc.  So it is a sort of golden handcuffs situation.  You think Boeing is going to accept making less money in a year?  Nope, they will just shift people over to making planes for other countries.\n\nCan cuts be done?  Sure, there was the recent example of the tanks being ordered that the Army doesn't even want.

However  the general conservative view point is that an open market will allow for competition from anyone.  This competition will allow the best ideas to win which will increase efficiency for society as a whole.  Social programs retard the drive for increased efficiency because people will settle into \"good enough\" and efficiencies will stall.\n\n1) The very presence of money does not in itself \"hinder competitiveness\".  Companies of all sizes continue to innovate all the time.  We live in a conglomerate world and have for a while and yet we see new ideas and products all the time.  Money allows for investment in new plants and processes, something that an inventor in their garage cannot afford.  If an individual/small company does come up with an idea then they grow and if the idea is good they often get approached to be bought by a mega-corp.  This does not mean that competition is in anyways being diminished.  Your example of solar proves the market efficiencies.  Solar is a new tech.  The entire world is geared for the existing oil economy.  Solar is demonstrably not as efficient a tech as oil is.  Will it be one day?  Probably.  However that day is not today.  Yet research into solar continues by both government and companies because innovation is happening all of the time.\n\n2) People are assholes and it's a complicated problem.  No one is surprised that there are fewer success stories from the ghetto as from middle and upper class suburbia.  Conservatives view it as a failure of the individual to rise above their problems rather than a problem the state needs to fix.  Conservatives feel that providing a saftey net quickly becomes a saftey hammock and there is no longer a desire in poor communities to achieve.

Think of it as double jeopardy: if Russia detonated a nuclear bomb/missile, they would have to be sure that they annihilated *all* of the United States' nuclear weapons in one fell swoop in order to avoid being attacked. Given that the United States' nuclear stockpile is the biggest in the world and could destroy it a few times over, this would be a tall order at best. The same would go for the United States: they would have to destroy all of Russia's nuclear weapons in order to assure that they would not be attacked. A bit more feasible, but still highly unlikely.\n\nThat being said, I do believe that it would not change anything. I think it would keep everyone on edge, but nuclear bombs are far too deadly to be used in warfare. I know that seems paradoxical, but the peripheral damage it inflicts, human or otherwise, makes them almost impossible to use. They are a tool for international diplomacy and international relations. A hollow threat that should be taken seriously all the same, but I highly doubt they would ever be used by the United States on Iran or vice versa. The North Korean weapon being detonated is inconsequential. The United States could destroy all of North Korea with nuclear warheads at the push of a button. Who knows what they're doing over there (besides being crazy) but, as I said before, nuclear weapons are just a tool in diplomacy rather than a tool in warfare. Iran or North Korea having a nuclear weapon doesn't mean they intend on using it during a conflict, it just means we're all supposed to say 'oh shit' and take them a bit more seriously. \n\nI've also never understood why the United States loved Israel so much anyway.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8lmin7", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361835834", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_197q39", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c8ln7lb", "parent_id": "t3_197q39", "score": -7, "retrieved_on": 1431410058, "controversiality": 0, "body": "There would be a brief exchange of radiation followed by centuries of a very quiet middle east.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8ln7lb", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361837931", "distinguished": null, "ups": -7}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_197q39", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "theonefree-man", "id": "t1_c8lpfwc", "parent_id": "t1_c8lp7r3", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431411154, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Because fuck logic.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8lpfwc", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361844596", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Not_a_Zaku", "id": "t1_c8lvuqo", "parent_id": "t1_c8lta6z", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431414207, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think you mean the Balkans, not Baltic.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_197q39", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8lvuqo", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361869924", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_197q39", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Yaaf", "id": "t1_c8lx1oo", "parent_id": "t1_c8lta6z", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431414761, "controversiality": 0, "body": "By \"the Baltic states\", do you mean Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania or do you mean every country around the Baltic sea (which would include countries like Sweden as well)? :P", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8lx1oo", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361881175", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c8lta6z", "parent_id": "t1_c8lp7r3", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431412964, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Because there is still a pretty nasty fight going on between muslims and christians there.

However, I don't think it is impossible for a new World War to start. American Hegemony has failed to deter non-state actors, which in a region as unstable as the Middle East is a dime a dozen.

Korea etc.), the follow-up to such a war would likely have most trade between non-allies severely diminished, meaning this would not deter an all out war.\n\nAs stated above, you're probably right in that under most circumstances this won't happen, but it still can. \n\nEdit: Forgot to add onto the trade argument that many groups, like the PLA in China are separate from the governing body and hold separate goals and are highly nationalistic, and arguably could act to increase China's global influence/ territory at the expense of trade, even if it would be against the country's interest as a whole. Also, in the scenario I outlined above, at the specific time of escalation to actual violence, the state actors (or actor, it only takes a handful to cause a mass breakout) are acting not rationally but out of paranoia and at the behest of parties who care little about what you've outlined above and out of personal interest.", "edited": 1361856253, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8lt80v", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361855781", "distinguished": null, "ups": 3}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "FishermanBob", "id": "t1_c8lszw7", "parent_id": "t1_c8lob2u", "score": 6, "retrieved_on": 1431412819, "controversiality": 0, "body": "There is not going to be another world war, and the Middle East certainly won't start it for 3 main reasons:\n\n1.

This, however, is not much different than the status quo, and I doubt the US will take any direct action against Iran if the Iranians are not directly aggressive (much like how they treat N. Korea). However, things would get interesting if Israel decided to act on its own and strike the facilities anyway, which, iirc, it has done before. This would most likely have Iran calling for war, calling out Israel as an aggressor on their \"peaceful\" nation (I put peaceful in quotations because although their actions are technically peaceful, much of their rhetoric is anything but). And, If we were to be totally realistic, it would probably end here in the short term (the next 5-10 years).\n\nNow, Iran is already one of the biggest, if not the biggest, power in the Middle East besides Israel and would use its new nuclear status to further bully old rivals like Iraq or some Sunni states, as well as maybe intervene in Syria, basically throw its weight around. New found alliances in the Middle East due to their new power as well as resentment over the last war against Israel would see many of the Arab nations once again united, possibly backed by Russia which has helped Iran with its nuclear and military ambitions in the past under the guide of Putin and seeks more influence in the Middle East. \n\nNow, the stage is set for a new world war, with the Middle East and Russia on one side and the US and Israel, and possibly Western Europe (who fear a rising Russia) on the other. Tensions at this point are at the highest they've been since the Cold War, and conflict is poised to erupt at anytime. Yet, it probably doesn't, and for the same reason these tensions rose in the first place; nuclear weapons. Mutually Assured Destruction (or MAD) as well as the proximity of the concerned parties leads us to believe that, if these states are rational actors (which if you disregard the political propaganda, they are), means no one wants to escalate conflict because there is simply too much to lose.\n\nThis is where the current instability in the Middle East would come into play. Political shifts in Egypt are seeming to favor a more Western culture and may see a shifting of sides, and regardless of the outcome of the revolution in Syria, the country would be in shambles, causing 2 major allies of Iran to either defect or cease to be an actor all together. This would cause paranoia among the leaders of the Middle East, thinking their side is now perceived as weak and open to attack, and now backed by war hawks in the Iranian government as well as Palestinian immigrants (who no longer live in Gaza or the West Bank following Israeli expansions justified by Iranian aggression), launch a preemptive strike, and basically cause World War III, leading to nuclear strikes in Israel, Iran, and much of the Middle East, although I suspect the US and Russia would refrain from participating due to the sheer number of weapons they have and the fact that the Middle East isn't THAT important to them. Ultimately, this leads to the Middle East being uninhabitable for generations, deep seated Muslim hatred towards the West due to the destruction of Mecca and Medina which causes a sharp influx of terrorist activities which will probably persist for the next couple of decades, and a mass exodus of survivors going either East to Pakistan or India, or more likely West to Europe and North America.\n\nA couple of key actors were intentionally left out because I couldn't really see where they would fit. These actors were\n\nA. China - invested economic interest in W. Europe and the US means war is not in their interests, however they very badly crave more international influence and have sided w/ Russia before on lesser issues against the US, so they could swing either way.\n\nB. Pakistan - As a Muslim state with strong anti-US sentiment among the populace, the could go with Iran, especially if India goes to the US. However, their government is friendly with the US and would probably like to side with the West, given the populaces anti-Shia sentiment as well.\n\nC. India - less of a toss-up than the other two, probably goes with the US, especially if Pakistan goes with Iran. If Pakistan sides with the West, I could see them trying to remain neutral, but China's involvement is also a big factor.\n\nWow, that ended up longer than expected, but it was fun to write.

There is a limited amount of space available for roads, especially when you get into cities where building more roads would require knocking down existing structures or creating road networks so complex that they would be a nightmare. What would happen in a downtown area? You can't just build more roads there. Same goes for a residential neighborhood or even most suburbs.

You're right that there are limited areas for roads, however, the market will handle it.  If the market cannot handle it, it is the proper role of the government to destroy monopolies.  If we had a good government, it would be limited to its proper roles; instead it is creating and assisting monopolies.  \n\nBut in a free market capitalism, if someone tried to monopolize the roads and charge monopoly prices, he would be destroyed by his customers, competitors or the government very quickly.

All of those have radically different results (which I won't attempt to predict).\n\nRegarding ballot measures in California: John Burton, the chairman of the California Democratic Party, did an [absolutely hilarious interview](http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-december-5-2011/california-s-direct-democracy-troubles) which outlined the issues we're facing over here with private money being used to circulate petitions and pass laws that impact state revenue and/or contradict the public's own interest.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8ei81m", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1360770865", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t3_18ee92", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431275315, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18ee92", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8e5h7d", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1360715333", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

Police can go to your ISP without a warrant and ask nicely if they wouldn't mind turning over logs and ISPs have a history of turning that information over.

But calling yourself a conservative does not make you one. Be careful that you don't fall into that trap, yourself. If you mean republican, it is not 'more politically correct' to refer to them as conservatives, because their platform doesn't fit neatly into the conservative framework. Republicans absolutely operate under conservative tendencies, but I would still resist giving them that blanket label. \n\nBut regardless of that, Christianity is what the majority of politicians, in every branch (both state and federal), claim faith to. That's both democrats and republicans. Those who do not identify with Christianity are in the minority. Conservatism is pervasive in both parties, and because over 70 percent of this country identifies as Christian, it is easy to claim 'most conservatives are Christian.' But that doesn't really mean anything because there really is no correlation between Christianity and conservatism as a political concept. It's just an observation of people in the United States. I can say most liberals are Christian with just as much fervor because, once again, with a vast majority of people claiming belief in that religion, that sentence is bound to be equally correct and hold an equal amount of meaning.\n\nConservative values have absolutely nothing to do with any religion, so it seems to me that the only people who would claim 'all conservatives are Christian' don't understand what conservatism is. Questions like this make it seem like there exists some sort of correlation but there isn't one, technically. It may be semantics but it makes a difference when answering this.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "The battle very much seems to be a PR one.  The US has had the same system since WW2, it is what people are used to, it is the \"the way it is\".  So in order to change something so massive, so ingrained, you need to come up with overwhelming support.  Single payer has a lot going for it but like anything it isn't perfect.  So it is a simple task for insurance companies with billions of dollars in ads, lobbyists, and campaign contributions to tell the America public that what we have is fine and that single payer isn't all that great.\n\nWho is championing it on the other side?  Politicians makes speeches and some public advocacy groups can raise some money but they have an uphill battle to change the entrenched system.  For every argument for single payer you have the other side screaming \"death panels\".  It doesn't matter that private insurance routinely denies expensive treatments to people and that CEOs of large companies make $10's of millions a year - money that could instead be put back into healthcare to lower costs etc.\n\nThe current system does have some benefits.  The insurance market is very, very competitive.  This competition can serve to drive costs down.  Competition also drives a huge variety of insurance products, there is something to meet basically any need you can think of.  I work in insurance and the options are staggering.\n\nThe downside to this is health insurance is usually marketed to businesses rather than the end customer, since most health insurance is tied to employment.  You, the insured, is not the customer - your employer is.  So insurance companies are trying to sell the best deal to your company even if that coverage isn't the kind you want or need.", "id": "t1_c82u659", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "funky_duck", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_174w9v", "id": "t1_c8332gm", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "tinkan", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c82u659", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431070358, "controversiality": 0, "body": "It absolutely was an issue used politically as a giant PR mechanism for which the GOP could muster up political support. Feigning resistance for a Republican idea allowed for the Tea Party wave to exist in the first place. The resistance to the ACA was built upon lie after lie and the basic \"perception\" of government control. The message and imagery was designed to outrage the low information voter and really hurt my opinion of a lot of voters in this country. The fact that the GOP nominated a Presidential candidate well known for instituting an individual mandate in his own state (which significantly improved health care coverage and overall was a good thing) and decided to run against it sums up how warped the entire issue was. \n\nThat and the bill is literally the Heritage foundation's idea (GOP think tank).
