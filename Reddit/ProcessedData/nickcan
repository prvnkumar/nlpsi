While there is no case I'm aware of directly on point, there are two cases that strongly reinforce the idea that the \"jurisdiction thereof\" clause is not toothless.\n\nFirst, in [U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Wong_Kim_Ark) there is dicta the clearly states the child of an ambasator is *not* a U.S. citizen:\n\n&gt; There are some exceptions which are founded upon peculiar reasons, and which, indeed, illustrate and confirm the general doctrine. Thus, a person who is born on the ocean is a subject of the prince to whom his parents then owe allegiance; for he is still deemed under the protection of his sovereign, and born in a place where he has dominion in common with all other sovereigns. So the children of an ambassador are held to be subjects of the prince whom he represents, although born under the actual protection and in the dominions of a foreign prince.\"\n\nSecond, [Elk v. Wilkins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elk_v._Wilkins) held that a tribe member born on the reservation of an un-taxed indian tribe is subject to tribal jurisdiction until he leaves the reservation and is thus *not* a U.S. citizen under the 14th amendment.

Parties must have standing, the dispute must be ripe (not premature) for adjudication, and it also must not be moot (already resolved in fact). Notably, there's what is called political question.  Courts will avoid adjudicating disputes between the Congress and the Executive under political doctrine.  The Judiiary, the Congress, and the Executive are all co-equal.  If a disagreement arises the Congres and the Executive should resolve their dispute through the political process not the judicial process.

Unlike a proportional representation system where coalitions are formed after an election between different parties, coalitions are formed before elections within parties.\n\n2 states actually do proportion electoral votes in this manner.  Nebraska and Maine.  Only Nebraska in 08 has actually split the votes.  Coincidentally, that district (Omaha) was promptly gerrymandered to prevent it from happening again and state republicans attempted to do away with the vote splitting system.  One affect you would see is a particularly viscous form of gerrymandering.  State borders cannot be redrawn so the problem is moot currently but obviously districts can be.  In addition it would change swing state dynamics.  Swing states would no longer be as important.  Campaigning would be done mostly in large cities all over the US because they tend to have more than one electoral vote and it is more efficient that way.  In general though it would lead to a much less accountable system because of gerrymandering concerns.  Actual voting would have less value because elections would be much more dependent on drawing lines on maps by lawmakers than by actual voting.", "id": "t1_c86sivy", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "1000facedhero", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_17m6rv", "score": 5, "retrieved_on": 1431138321, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_17m6rv", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c86sivy", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1359617666", "ups": 5, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c86tglr", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Zorastar", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_17m6rv", "selftext": "I'm not aware of any states that use the proportional formula you describe.

OK, one can argue that the House is meant to represent various districts and interests rather than straight party preferences. \n\nBut the Red Map would make an electoral-popular split in a presidential election much more likely. From what I've read, if enough states had implemented the plan pre-2012, Romney would have won the presidency with 270 electoral votes despite handily losing the popular vote. If that happened consistently, then I don't think people would stand for it -- or at least I hope they wouldn't.
