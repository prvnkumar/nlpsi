In a larger -let's pretend we can consider objectivity- sense, I'm fairly certain that I am indeed, totally insignificant. Or rather, about as significant as a single grain of sand is to a beach. But the \"educated guesses\" part is interesting because I think that most people who really are scientists, as in, they work as scientists, treat the predictions of the sciences as educated guesses because that's what they are. It seems that it's mostly laypeople who treat scientific laws as \"truths.\" \n\nBut it's very interesting to me that you bring up language, because I think that's where so much of our confusion lies. I'm actually a Linguistics student (the long response time is because I had to go to a class), and I have this personal pet theory that when we speak, we are essentially making a gamble that the listener will interpret the series of sounds we made the way we meant for them to be interpreted. The mistake, I think, is thinking that listeners are capable of getting it exactly right. I would argue that our conceptions of what words mean are highly personal to the point of being more or less unique. This problem compounds itself at the level of phrases, and then again at the level of combined phrases. So even if we obtain the desired result, that was just happenstance; the listener behaved in the manner we meant to elicit, but that doesn't say anything about whether s/he interpreted our words the way we meant. This is a really hard idea to get across, but to me it's analogous to certain types of robots that have been developed that appear to \"learn\" by reacting to each other in certain ways and adapting their reactions according to changing parameters. It's not that the robots really understand what they are doing, and they certainly have no understanding of the signals they are receiving, but from our perspective it looks like learning. I think that we make this perceptual mistake with regards to our communications on a very fundamental level.\n\nAnother limitation of language is wrapped up in words like \"is.\" Nothing \"is\" in any objective sense. I mean, really, try to think of what it means to \"be\" independently of an observer. Yet the word \"is\" *means* to *be*, so we fool ourselves into thinking that there are concrete properties around us, when really they are illusions borne by our perception.\n\nHow this relates to rugged individualism I'm not sure because that was a hell of a tangent, but I think those who tend to espouse laissez-faire economics base their arguments off of flawed principles. You'll hear rational economists claim that consumers might not be rational but they behave \"as if\" they are; this, to me, is the height of mendacity. These arguments are conceived in reverse. The other flawed principle is the one I already mentioned, where people think they got where they are on their own. This always seems to have a degree of indignation accompanying it, so I suspect it's driven more by personal feelings than any rational argument, and it's just so blatantly false, I don't even know where to start.

I would argue that our conceptions of what words mean are highly personal to the point of being more or less unique.

He is quoting Hayek for a precise reason and not Keynes, or Krugman or someone else. Because Hayek is traditionally considered as an Austrian.\n\nHe IS the authority. And there is no logic in his argument. All he has said is \"In Book X, Author Y has explicitly supported the viewpoint that govt alone can do A, B, C and D\".\n\nTo put it simply, something is considered as an appeal to authority, if the opponent cannot respond to that argument without attacking the individual.\n\nLike if I said \"But Plato said Man is a rational animal\", there's no argumentation here, its just a declarative statement and name of a famous person thrown in there.\n\nOn the other hand if I said \"As Plato said, man is only an animal because he is run by his instincts, but he is able to use reason to override his instincts, therefore he is a rational animal\", then I can actually critique this argument.\n\n&gt; Care to explain the difference?\n\nSure, Austrian Economics is a social science. Austrian Economics actually doesn't do justice with the science, Praxeology on the other hand is a much better term. Praxeology is a whole science which includes epistemology, methodology and methods, in addition to actual economics conclusion and study of prices(Catallactics, which is what most mainstream economics is focused at).\n\nThe Libertarianism is merely a conclusion of the sciences in order to achieve a better quality of life. But critiquing the conclusions(i.e. that 'we NEED the govt') is like imagine if medical sciences tells you that smoking is bad for your health and you critique medical sciences by talking about how much impossibile it would be for you to live your life without smoking.\n\nWhether or not you need government is not going to prove or disprove Austrian Economics. Unfortunately OP only knows about the libertarian conclusions of AE. That's why he thinks \"Good critique of Austrian Economics\" = \"Good critique of Libertarianism\".\n\n&gt; Specifically...?\n\nAs I pointed out earlier, appeal to authority by quoting the apparent \"Nobel Prize winning Austrian Economist\". \n\nAnd read this \"you're confronting a cult of dogmatic ideology that was invented as a substitute for religion by greedy American materialists\", are you telling me you don't see a logical fallacy in this statement?\n\nOr this \"They would deny the color of the sky, or even these words of their own leader, in order to rationalize their personal self-supremacist agenda.\"", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8hv16c", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361291355", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c8h8koh", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431338077, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18qopd", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8hql42", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361264466", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c8h8059", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431329162, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Libertarianism, although Is quite close to Austrian Economics, is not the same thing as AE.

What happens when there is more demand for a product (labor)?  Prices rise.  And those employees begin to save money and slowly become middle class over the course of even a decade.  It ignites a fire that lifts the economy... but soon the prices get uncompetitive for manufacturing, so those factories begin to move to the next place.  Right now its China.

Even more, we rarely have the granularity to focus on just a smaller segment of the population - we look at unemployment in total and perhaps by state, but both of those are far too large to capture just those impacted by minimum wage.  Teen unemployment has been used as a barometer, as has the black unemployment rate as those two demographics tilt more to lower-paying jobs than the population in general.\n\nThe debate over minimum wage will never be settled because, many times, there are tipping points that are hard to predict.  Raising minimum wage by 5% from $10 to $10.50 might have very little impact.  But then raising it 4.7% again to $11 (trying to use simple numbers) might have a huge impact far more than anyone estimated.

Read it with an open mind.  I even agreed with them that a small minimum wage hike was no panacea for poverty.  And I really enjoyed their suggestion that as a better way to help the working poor, \"we\" should incorporate a \"negative income tax,\" similar to the earned income credit; such that low-skilled workers would receive a kind of tax refund to compensate their low wages.

I believe yes - but not until they have attained full majority one last time.\n\n\n\nFirst off, the good and noble values of the original conservatism : the rugged self-sufficiency, the prudence, the quiet confidence, the worship of a greater, nurturing Spirit, the stoicism - indeed, **all** the things that made our early heroes seem heroic -- has been effectively and completely co-opted and bastardized by the evil of modern politics.  Confident self-reliance has been replaced by vulgar pride, the worship of a benevolent God has become sloven adherence to \"the Prosperity Gospel\" of personal wealth, and prudent frugality has been replaced by thoughtless stinginess.  Worse, intellectual humility and respect for wisdom and education has been de-valued and replaced by a cult like adoration of superficial dogma and harsh judgment of any independent thought.
