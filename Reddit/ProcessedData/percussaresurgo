Then, for a long time after that, marriage was done in a transactional manner for pragmatic reasons, to ensure that offspring were \"legitimate.\" There was no love involved, and the idea of romantic love that we now think of as a prerequisite for marriage did not arise until the middle ages. \n\nSomewhere along the line, the government began to use the word \"marriage\" in legislation and entwined public policy with what had before been a personal and/or religious arrangement. At that time, however, all marriages were done in the church, so there was no reason to have a different term to refer to the rights afforded a married couple under the law. Thus, marriage is still recognized by law.\n\nAs I said above, I think everyone should be able to marry, but only because as things are now that is the only way give everyone equal rights.

Because all independent research would disagree but there is no profit in that.\n\n\n", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "reddititis", "id": "t1_c913j4b", "parent_id": "t1_c912lyq", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431680055, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1au4vh", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c913j4b", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364067077", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c912lyq", "parent_id": "t1_c912jum", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431679623, "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": 1364064184, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1au4vh", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c912lyq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364063802", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "reddititis", "id": "t1_c912jum", "parent_id": "t1_c911jdg", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431679595, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1364064499, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c912jum", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364063598", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c911jdg", "parent_id": "t1_c90yqud", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431679116, "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1au4vh", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c911jdg", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364059976", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "reddititis", "id": "t1_c90yqud", "parent_id": "t1_c90u5jb", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431677800, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1au4vh", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c90yqud", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364048598", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c911p4i", "parent_id": "t1_c90zix6", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431679192, "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1au4vh", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c911p4i", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364060542", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "punarvasu", "id": "t1_c90zix6", "parent_id": "t1_c90u5jb", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1431678169, "controversiality": 0, "body": "you're making a really tough argument.  those countries spend much less than we do and get better health outcomes. we spend nearly 18% of gdp now... france is at 11 or 12% I think, Sweden is around 9%.  \n\nyou're assuming it's this expensive technology that makes for better care, but that's obviously not the case. their care is cheaper because they use less of these expensive modern things, and because their health systems on the whole have lower prices.

But its done this way to keep costs down for women who really *do* need the coverage for the two or three times its actually needed.  But even after menopause, when they realistically no longer need it, they *still* pay for that coverage.\n\nThe biggest reason health insurance costs as much as it does has more to do with what it covers than anything else.  All insurance is basically risk-based pricing: take condition A, estimate the cost of treatment times the cost of an individual acquiring that condition.  Then do the same with Condition B, C, D... etc.  That's how you roughly calculate the cost of the premium.

But I think you're missing some important factors in the cost of healthcare: hospital profit and insurance investor profit.

Of course like any business, they have overhead. But I don't see the justification that clearly. And insurance investor profit, in my opinion, works like any other for-profit corporation in that they maximize profit to keep investors happy.

They own it.  If they want to draw out money for their families, its their business.  I draw out money from *my* business when my wife and I want to go on vacation.  Should I not be allowed to do that?\n\n&gt;You can be sure that all the managers and owners and office workers and their families have health insurance. But the mentally handicapped guy who's been bagging groceries there for 25 years doesn't get that benefit.\n\nNow my business is almost entirely office-based, but I have clients who are not (plumbers, for example).  He doesn't offer insurance to those guys (well under 50 employees) because *he doesn't have to in order to compete*.  Now, if it were me, I'd probably make an exception for the guy who has been sacking for 25-years, but I imagine there's also someone else living with him or he's living at home.  But under Obamacare, *I can't*.  I have to treat them all the same, so the college student that works full time and will leave after college I have to treat the same as the 25-year sacker.  That doesn't make economic sense.\n\nNevermind, the college student probably doesn't need the same level of insurance coverage as the 25-year sacker.  They need something more akin to a HDHP/HSA combination since the odds of having large bills for them is relatively small.  Instead we're going to make them buy something that they really don't need...\n\nThere are all sorts of economic problems with Obamacare, greed is not even addressed by it.\n\n&gt;That's why we need laws like Obamacare because a lot of the richest people in this country just don't give a damn about the people who work for them. They see their employees as an expense rather than a human being who has to survive on the $9 an hour they pay them to unload bananas for 8 hours a day.\n\nDo the workers give a damn about the people employing them?  In most cases not - they'll leave at the first sign of more money or better conditions.  And you're just looking at the reality of low-skill, low-wage workers.  Obamacare cannot change economic reality.  The employer-provided portion of health insurance is *expensive*.  Tomorrow I can look at what I pay, per employee, if you'd like.

Do you know why? Because we have a system where employers are expected to give health insurance to their employees. It's a terrible way to handle health care and it drives up costs for everyone.\n\nDo you know why we moved to an employer-based system?  Because back during WW2 there was a wage freeze so employers had to find a new way to compete for talent.  It also shows just how remarkable (and not business-dominated) the labor market is; within a generation *not* having health and dental from your employer was enough for employees to turn down a job.  You can chalk this up to the law of unintended consequences.\n\n&gt; It's ridiculous that our employers control what kind of health insurance we get. Just imagine how much money businessnes would save if they didn't have to buy health insurnace for their employees!\n\nThey really wouldn't save that much.  Employees/voters would throw a huge fit if health insurance were dropped and there was no increase in pay - the employees would have a new expense and no new income to use to cover it.  You'll also not on your 2012 W-2, employers have to provide how much they paid on the employee's behalf; this is presumably what they would pay the employee if there was no employer-provided plan.\n\n&gt;But of course then we'd have to offer a public option and that would be socialism.....even though it would be like a multi billion dollar savings for american businesses. \n\nWhy go the single-payer route?  Why not remove the employer portion and let people make their own decisions about what kind of insurance they need... or if they even need insurance?  Why does every \"fix\" involve more and more government control of the population and a limitation of choice?  Not to mention it probably wouldn't save businesses much as those new taxes to cover the single-payer system would end up being more heavily on the rich anyway.\n\n&gt; The store is owned by a huge family. Anyone that shares the last name of the family (husbands, wives, children) even if they are not directly related to anyone who still owns part of the company pretty much just steals from the store. They take groceries but worse, everyone uses the stores' gas pumps to fill up their cars for free. (they're supposed to be for store vehicles only.)\n\nIf the store owner knows and allows it, then its not really \"stealing\".  Who are you to decide that he can't do what he wants with his property?\n\n&gt; And of course, some family members are on the ghost payroll. They get salaries (and health insurance, lol) and never actually have to show up.\n\nWelcome to advanced tax strategies 101.  In many cases, it is far cheaper, in terms of taxes paid, to put family members on the payroll for, say, $30k annually than to take that as additional profit/income.  If the store is profitable enough, its a way to support your family (and extended family) without incurring massive taxes.  Marginal taxes at $30k are 15%.  Add in another 15% for all the other taxes (FICA, FUTA, etc) and you're at a total rate of 30%, cash in their pockets.\n\nOn the other hand, take that money as profit and...\n\n* if a c-corp, you pay 34+% on the corporate level, then a 15% dividends on top of that (so we're at 44% already).  Then, to get that money to the family member, you're going to pay gift-taxes to get that money to them in excess of $13k or eat into your lifetime exemption.  But that'd go fast.\n* If a s-corp/flow-through, you're paying the actual personal income tax rate (I'm going to assume marginal of 35%) and then gift taxes as well.  Still far higher than just employing them and not having them do anything.\n\nAnd again, who are you to tell them how they take care of their family?\n\n&gt;When a company will give insurance to the founder's drunk grandson who doesn't actually work at the store but not the bagger who's been there 25 years well then yeah, I call that greed.\n\nMaybe.  But do you know all the situations going on?  Perhaps there circumstances you don't know about.  Or perhaps the store cannot remain profitable (even including these salaries and associated expenses as \"profit) once you start dolling out full medical benefits to every employee.  I provide my employees with BSBC HDHP, fully covered for the employee (no out of pocket) plus $500 into the HSA, for family the employee is still covered and $1000 into HSA.  The cost to me for an individual is $641 each month (plus the $500 divided by 12).  The old PPO (traditional health insurance) that I had to drop - its total cost was over $1200 per month.  Add on top of that dental, vision, short-term disability, etc, and it really starts to add up fast.  People don't realize how much those things cost.\n\nIt also comes down to this - why should I pay more than I have to for an employee?  Especially a low-skilled one that I can replace fairly easily?  I usually have a graduate student from a local university work PT during tax season to help me out, plus give them experience (for their resume).  I pay then $10/hour for 20-hours a week.  Giving them medical would be essentially paying $18/hr ($641/20*4).  When was the last time you paid almost twice what the grocery store charged for milk or fruit?", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1au4vh", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;The family that owns those grocery stores aren't putting people on the ghost payroll for tax reasons. These people aren't owners and they wouldn't be entitled to any profits. They're just the family screw-ups. if you screw up long enough or show up drunk too many times the family just pays you to stay away from the store.\n\nAnd that's the family's decision to make not yours.  I figured that the owners wanted to get money to those family members.  Having them as a ghost employee makes it \"cheaper\" in the end.\n\n&gt;You have to pay more for an employee because it's the ~~ethical~~ *moral* thing to do.\n\nI guess I could argue that point, but is it moral to employ 100 people at a higher wage or 100 people at a lower wage?  Considering unemployment is high right now, would the ethical thing not be to wage each employee less than than the maximum I could, but employee more people?  Why do you get money that could go to somewhere else?  (That's the fallacy of that argument - there is always someone worse off).\n\n&gt; But a lot of business owners obviously dont see health insurance as an ~~ethical~~ *moral* choice.\n\nI marked it above, but you're confusing \"ethical\" with \"moral\".  Business ethics does not mean moral.  If I pay everyone fairly with their skills and in alignment with the laws, I'm being ethical - I'm not cheating anyone.  But if I want to do something that abides to some higher power - fairness, religion, etc - then that's a moral decision.  Some people make that decision (I offer my employees either the HDHP or the cash I would have payed otherwise.  That's my moral decision) and some people don't.  But I thought people didn't like pushing morals on others.  I guess unless its the *right* morals.\n\n&gt;Because if the guy who runs a grocery store could pay a mentally handicapped man $4 per hour he would because he would know no one else would hire the guy.\n\nMentally handicap throws a moral issue into the mix (how do we treat them).  Substitute this man with a no-motivation high school dropout instead - the other end of the spectrum.  Or perhaps someone who *can* do but instead has decided instead of using his skills, he wants to sit around and do other things all day (pick your vice).  That's who minimum wage really protects far, *far* more often than the mentally handicapped/infirm.\n\n&gt;A full time worker making the minimum wage earns about $14,000. That's not enough to pay for rent, let alone health insurance. That means that millions of low-wage workers need welfare, food stamps, medicare to survive even though they have a full time job. Basically the taxpayers are subsidizing corporate greed and that's outrageous. **If a business owner can't afford to pay his employees a living wage then he can't afford to run a business in the USA.**\n\nDepends on the type of business - all my employees make a living wage, nice wages on top of that.  I just finished my taxes - I'm definitely in the 1%.  But that's because my industry (CPA/audit/tax) requires highly skilled people and my customers pay ridiculous amounts per hour for our expertise and skills.  Sackers, unfortunately, do not command such salaries.\n\nAgain, I ask how often you intentionally overpay for something you could get for cheaper.  You're asking the business owner to do that - so why are you not yourself?  Its easy to ask the \"other\" to do something, but not require yourself.  Its the classic argument against Buffet and those who want to pay more taxes.  Trust me, I've dealt with the IRS enough - they will let you overpay on your taxes.  The Treasury also takes checks.  But they don't *want* to do it, they want *others* to do it.  And I bet if their laws got passed, they already have things in mind how to limit their own liabilities.

Do you know why?  Because we have a system where employers are expected to give health insurance to their employees.  It's a terrible way to handle health care and it drives up costs for everyone.

It's ridiculous that our employers control what kind of health insurance we get.  Just imagine how much money businessnes would save if they didn't have to buy health insurnace for their employees!

Anyone that shares the last name of the family (husbands, wives, children) even if they are not directly related to anyone who still owns part of the company pretty much just steals from the store.  They take groceries but worse, everyone uses the stores' gas pumps to fill up their cars for free.  (they're supposed to be for store vehicles only.)  And of course, some family members are on the ghost payroll.  They get salaries (and health insurance, lol) and never actually have to show up.

Most of these workers are young and are, in fact, gaining skills and experience.\n\n&gt;The real problem with \"poverty\" in America is not due to a low minimum wage (it makes it a bit worse) but rather we have one-earner, single parent families or families with one parent who cannot find a job. Making it harder for those families to find a job is the wrong way to go.\n\nThere will always be some unemployment, and some families have a disabled parent who cannot work. The idea that raising the minimum wage increases unemployment has been shown to be [false](http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2013/02/department-of-labor-minimum-wage.html), and the opposite may actually be [true](http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/11/18/does-raising-minimum-wage-increase-unemployment/).\n\nFurthermore, I don't think you're taking into account the increasing inequality in America and the shrinking of the middle class, both of which are slowed by raising the minimum wage.

It found that household income in 2011 fell 1.5 percent, to its lowest level in 16 years, $50,054.

It's no exaggeration to say that for the US to remain the world's only superpower, inequality must be brought under control, and raising the minimum wage helps do that.\n", "id": "t1_c8freyh", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "percussaresurgo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_18ji1l", "selftext": "&gt;Most of these workers are young and are, in fact, gaining skills and experience.\n\nThen they will not be making minimum wage very long, will they?

In other words, a miserable existence. \n\nFunny you say that because I know several people working for far, far more than minimum wage that average much more time at work than 52, 40-hour work weeks.  You do it because you want better in the future.  Now, there are few full-time minimum wage jobs to begin with, so its a bit of a stretch to even discuss the idea of someone working that schedule.\n\nBut remember - this is the bare minimum we can pay anyone, regardless of skills and education.  That means there will be people in this group that are being paid far, far more than their time to the employer is really worth.\n\n&gt;The idea that raising the minimum wage increases unemployment has been shown to be false, and the opposite may actually be true.\n\nYou probably replied to my other post, because I saw the same links.  Read further in your second post to why it doesn't hold true - it, ironically, corrected another market issue.  And I had more reply there.\n\n&gt;Furthermore, I don't think you're taking into account the increasing inequality in America and the shrinking of the middle class, both of which are slowed by raising the minimum wage. The increasingly unequal distribution of income poses a danger to the social fabric as well as to the American economy. The September 2012 report on income and poverty released by the United States Census provides the left with additional ammunition. It found that household income in 2011 fell 1.5 percent, to its lowest level in 16 years, $50,054. Most arresting, the gap between the incomes of rich and poor expanded further than it had at any time in the past 40 years.\n\nIs income inequality a bad thing?  First, I think measuring income only is foolish without understanding what the purchasing power of that income is.  Today a person's standard of living is much higher than even 20 years ago.  Think of all the things they have now that only the ultra-rich would have had before.  Hell, just think of the knowledge now available that before would have been hidden behind the doors of Havard.\n\nBut further to my point - say the income gap is 10:1.  If the poor end up gaining 50% and the rich end up gaining 60% (both in real terms), is that increase in income inequality a bad thing?  No, even the poor are better off than they were before.  And closing income inequality is one thing most people don't really know how to do.  As education and skills become a greater and greater part of the job market, you're going to see more and more.  Fifty years ago my father could go into a factory and make about half of what the manager of the factory made.  He could make a good living on his own.  That's not the case anymore - you need much more investment in a person to get to that point where my father was out of high school.

Now, there are few full-time minimum wage jobs to begin with, so its a bit of a stretch to even discuss the idea of someone working that schedule.\n\nBut remember - this is the bare minimum we can pay anyone, regardless of skills and education.  That means there will be people in this group that are being paid far, far more than their time to the employer is really worth.\n\n&gt;The idea that raising the minimum wage increases unemployment has been shown to be false, and the opposite may actually be true.\n\nYou probably replied to my other post, because I saw the same links.  Read further in your second post to why it doesn't hold true - it, ironically, corrected another market issue.

Most arresting, the gap between the incomes of rich and poor expanded further than it had at any time in the past 40 years.\n\nIs income inequality a bad thing?  First, I think measuring income only is foolish without understanding what the purchasing power of that income is.  Today a person's standard of living is much higher than even 20 years ago.  Think of all the things they have now that only the ultra-rich would have had before.  Hell, just think of the knowledge now available that before would have been hidden behind the doors of Havard.\n\nBut further to my point - say the income gap is 10:1.  If the poor end up gaining 50% and the rich end up gaining 60% (both in real terms), is that increase in income inequality a bad thing?  No, even the poor are better off than they were before.  And closing income inequality is one thing most people don't really know how to do.  As education and skills become a greater and greater part of the job market, you're going to see more and more.  Fifty years ago my father could go into a factory and make about half of what the manager of the factory made.  He could make a good living on his own.  That's not the case anymore - you need much more investment in a person to get to that point where my father was out of high school.  That's an entirely different point.\n\nBut I see more and more people popping out a single metric and screaming how it needs to be fixed.  Yes, income inequality looks to be worse than before.

This is literally the bottom of the labor market. To think someone can have so little to give their employer and yet be able to have an \"adequate qualify of life\" is just foolish.\n\nThere will always be people earning the minimum wage and there will always be a \"bottom\" of the labor market. These people do jobs that need to be done. There are already plenty of college graduates working as waiters and other low-skilled positions. Anyone who is doing a job we rely on and is working hard should earn at least enough to live an decent life. To say otherwise is cruel and inhumane.\n\n&gt;If you're in this situation, you should not be living alone and you should not have children. Then again, those would be intelligent decisions.\n\nAs they study you cite says, most people earning the minimum wage are young. Young people are also much less likely to be married, and telling them that they should get married just for the economic benefit is foolish and would have serious detrimental effects on society. Knowing that most minimum wage workers are young, it stands to reason that many are in school or don't have the work experience yet to earn a higher wage, and not earning minimum wage because they are stupid. Knowing that, I don't know why you display such disdain for minimum wage workers to say something as ignorant like \"then again, those would be intelligent decisions,\" especially when they are doing jobs that benefit society and that the rest of us don't want to do.\n\n&gt;Minimum wage is marginal at best in improving those lives, given that it exacerbates unemployment for those jobs.\n\nThis is a myth. Studies show that raising the minimum wage either has [no effect](http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2013/02/department-of-labor-minimum-wage.html) on unemployment, or it actually [lowers it](http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/11/18/does-raising-minimum-wage-increase-unemployment/).", "id": "t1_c8fqqnm", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "percussaresurgo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_18ji1l", "selftext": "And I can find studies that show the opposite.

It contains the following sentence:\n\n&gt;Of course, few modern-day economists argue that an increase in the minimum wage will actually create jobs in America, and such policies failed dismally during the Great Depression. Magruder explains why the policy may have worked in Indonesia, but not in Depression-era America: One, as a less-developed country receiving substantial foreign investment, Indonesia may have had new access to potential, unadopted, and profitable technologies that simply needed a market. A second is that much of the 1990s were a time of growth in Indonesia, when sticky wages may have limited wage growth (the opposite of conditions in the depression). Finally, Harrison and Scorce (2010) show that anti-sweatshop activism also raised labor standards in foreign firms without an accompanying drop in employment. This indicates that wages may have indeed been below marginal products in the 1990s, reducing coordination and creating an opening for policy.\n\nIt worked because of an odd situation, but doubts that it would actually do that here.  In a functioning economic market, raising the price of a good reduces the demand of it.  That's the basic law of demand.  I would argue, though, that its difficult to see the impact of a change in minimum wage because we don't live in a truly rational market for labor.  A change might show no impact even if every economist said it would.  Why?  People might not see changing everything to be worth their time.

Most arresting, the gap between the incomes of rich and poor expanded further than it had at any time in the past 40 years.\n\nIs income inequality a bad thing?  First, I think measuring income only is foolish without understanding what the purchasing power of that income is.  Today a person's standard of living is much higher than even 20 years ago.  Think of all the things they have now that only the ultra-rich would have had before.  Hell, just think of the knowledge now available that before would have been hidden behind the doors of Havard.\n\nBut further to my point - say the income gap is 10:1.  If the poor end up gaining 50% and the rich end up gaining 60% (both in real terms), is that increase in income inequality a bad thing?  No, even the poor are better off than they were before.  And closing income inequality is one thing most people don't really know how to do.  As education and skills become a greater and greater part of the job market, you're going to see more and more.  Fifty years ago my father could go into a factory and make about half of what the manager of the factory made.  He could make a good living on his own.  That's not the case anymore - you need much more investment in a person to get to that point where my father was out of high school.  That's an entirely different point.\n\nBut I see more and more people popping out a single metric and screaming how it needs to be fixed.  Yes, income inequality looks to be worse than before.

As I said before, the income gap is the most powerful indicator of a healthy, functioning society. As income disparity spikes, so to do rates of homicide, obesity, drug use, mental illness, anxiety, teenage pregnancy, and high school dropouts. \n\nEdit: Additionally, inequality in the US is passed from generation to generation. This lack of social and economic mobility is a huge disincentive to hard work and innovation, for both rich and poor, because there is a great likelihood that no matter how hard you work or how creative and talented you are, a person is probably going to end up where they started.", "id": "t1_c8fs6bm", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "percussaresurgo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_18ji1l", "selftext": "&gt;It's much easier to work long hours when you're earning good money.

My parents were as much the working poor as you could get.  But they made sure that I knew that anything short of going to college meant I was a failure.

Not only is that inhumane, but it puts the burden on the public should anything go wrong, especially since most min wage jobs have little if any health and retirement benefits.\n\n&gt;I'm proof that what you said is not true.\n\nYou, or any other individual story, is not enough to disprove a statistic showing a general trend. The fact is that, in the US, the single biggest determinative factor of where someone ends up in life is where they started.

This is literally the bottom of the labor market. To think someone can have so little to give their employer and yet be able to have an \"adequate qualify of life\" is just foolish.\n\nThere will always be people earning the minimum wage and there will always be a \"bottom\" of the labor market. These people do jobs that need to be done. There are already plenty of college graduates working as waiters and other low-skilled positions. Anyone who is doing a job we rely on and is working hard should earn at least enough to live an decent life. To say otherwise is cruel and inhumane.\n\n&gt;If you're in this situation, you should not be living alone and you should not have children. Then again, those would be intelligent decisions.\n\nAs they study you cite says, most people earning the minimum wage are young. Young people are also much less likely to be married, and telling them that they should get married just for the economic benefit is foolish and would have serious detrimental effects on society. Knowing that most minimum wage workers are young, it stands to reason that many are in school or don't have the work experience yet to earn a higher wage, and not earning minimum wage because they are stupid. Knowing that, I don't know why you display such disdain for minimum wage workers to say something as ignorant like \"then again, those would be intelligent decisions,\" especially when they are doing jobs that benefit society and that the rest of us don't want to do.\n\n&gt;Minimum wage is marginal at best in improving those lives, given that it exacerbates unemployment for those jobs.\n\nThis is a myth. Studies show that raising the minimum wage either has [no effect](http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2013/02/department-of-labor-minimum-wage.html) on unemployment, or it actually [lowers it](http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/11/18/does-raising-minimum-wage-increase-unemployment/).", "id": "t1_c8fqqnm", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "percussaresurgo", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_18ji1l", "selftext": "And I can find studies that show the opposite.  [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage#Empirical_studies) actually has a pretty good cross-section of different studies.  But did you actually read your second source?  It contains the following sentence:\n\n&gt;Of course, few modern-day economists argue that an increase in the minimum wage will actually create jobs in America, and such policies failed dismally during the Great Depression. Magruder explains why the policy may have worked in Indonesia, but not in Depression-era America: One, as a less-developed country receiving substantial foreign investment, Indonesia may have had new access to potential, unadopted, and profitable technologies that simply needed a market. A second is that much of the 1990s were a time of growth in Indonesia, when sticky wages may have limited wage growth (the opposite of conditions in the depression). Finally, Harrison and Scorce (2010) show that anti-sweatshop activism also raised labor standards in foreign firms without an accompanying drop in employment. This indicates that wages may have indeed been below marginal products in the 1990s, reducing coordination and creating an opening for policy.\n\nIt worked because of an odd situation, but doubts that it would actually do that here.  In a functioning economic market, raising the price of a good reduces the demand of it.  That's the basic law of demand.  I would argue, though, that its difficult to see the impact of a change in minimum wage because we don't live in a truly rational market for labor.  A change might show no impact even if every economist said it would.  Why?  People might not see changing everything to be worth their time.
