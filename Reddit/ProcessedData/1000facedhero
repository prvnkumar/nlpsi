{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Short answer is no the shutdown does not affect the ACA.  There are two types of funding annual and mandatory spending.  Mandatory spending is written into the law so it happens no matter what.  Social security spending does not get authorized each year it just happens because the law is written as mandatory spending.  The budget deals with the annual appropriations to various programs.  These programs need to be approved every year.  Things like NASA's budget need to get funding every year.  So no budget no NASA funding.  The money in the ACA is either already spent on setting up the exchanges or given out in grants, or mandatory spending, like medicaid expansion or the subsidies on the exchanges.  In order to change mandatory spending you need to pass a law changing the current law because it doesn't expire.  So to change or defund the ACA you need both houses of congress and the president to approve.  Republicans don't have the votes in the senate or the White House because they didn't win the elections in 2012.

I can walk up to the poll and say I'm my next door neighbor and they have no way to tell if I'm actually him or not.\n\nExcept when your neighbor then walks up and tries to vote.  It is ridiculously easy to get caught with a very low payoff.  By my quick back of the envelope [math](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/turnout.php) you get a little less than 70% of registered voters turning out in presidential elections.  If it was a widespread problem people would get caught.  When less than 1 person per year gets caught doing something it isn't exactly widespread.  Your claim basically implies that because we don't know the exact numbers of people who did a crime we should assume it is widespread.  \n\n&gt;I don't think its necessarily needed, but I think the main argument that it somehow depresses voter turnout is not a compelling one - except for those without IDs, the only people who would not be voting are those who would do so illegally.\n\nWell this is certainly an interesting way to evaluate how much of an effect voter id has.  Ignoring those people without proper id seems to be kind of disingenuous.  And there are many more issues than just having a photo id.  Your id has to be valid (ie have the correct address).  This can create a burden for mobile populations like college students who tend to move every 4 months or so.  Others such as the elderly or blind who do not drive do not update their ID often.  Urban poor without cars also do not have IDs this is more pronounced in minority populations as well.  There are also informational barriers as those trying to obtain information on what they need to vote may not get the correct information.  In fact, studies have shown that merely having a minority sounding name means that you are more likely to get incorrect information and get less comprehensive and useful responses from those who administer elections.  Rural areas also have an issue that their DMVs are further away and are open less frequently in some cases are only open once a month.  \n\nYes for your walk of life an ID may be a necessity.  However, for many people it is not.  That does not mean that they do not get a voice in government.  One should make sure there is an actual problem before one makes restrictions which decrease turnout (~2%).

I can walk up to the poll and say I'm my next door neighbor and they have no way to tell if I'm actually him or not.\n\nExcept when your neighbor then walks up and tries to vote.  It is ridiculously easy to get caught with a very low payoff.  By my quick back of the envelope [math](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/turnout.php) you get a little less than 70% of registered voters turning out in presidential elections.  If it was a widespread problem people would get caught.  When less than 1 person per year gets caught doing something it isn't exactly widespread.  Your claim basically implies that because we don't know the exact numbers of people who did a crime we should assume it is widespread.  \n\n&gt;I don't think its necessarily needed, but I think the main argument that it somehow depresses voter turnout is not a compelling one - except for those without IDs, the only people who would not be voting are those who would do so illegally.\n\nWell this is certainly an interesting way to evaluate how much of an effect voter id has.  Ignoring those people without proper id seems to be kind of disingenuous.  And there are many more issues than just having a photo id.  Your id has to be valid (ie have the correct address).  This can create a burden for mobile populations like college students who tend to move every 4 months or so.  Others such as the elderly or blind who do not drive do not update their ID often.  Urban poor without cars also do not have IDs this is more pronounced in minority populations as well.  There are also informational barriers as those trying to obtain information on what they need to vote may not get the correct information.  In fact, studies have shown that merely having a minority sounding name means that you are more likely to get incorrect information and get less comprehensive and useful responses from those who administer elections.  Rural areas also have an issue that their DMVs are further away and are open less frequently in some cases are only open once a month.  \n\nYes for your walk of life an ID may be a necessity.  However, for many people it is not.  That does not mean that they do not get a voice in government.  One should make sure there is an actual problem before one makes restrictions which decrease turnout (~2%).

In the case of a college student, unless they are declaring their dorm their permanent residence (which I don't believe dorms allow anyway), they're going to be voting in their district at home, not at college.

A new \u201cW-visa\u201d program for low-skilled guest workers, capped at 20,000, would start in 2015. The cap would rise to 75,000 by 2019. Immigrants would apply at U.S. embassies and consulates in their home countries, and would stay in three-year renewable stints along with their families. If they are unemployed for 60 days or more they would  be required to leave the United States. The workers must be paid the prevailing wage and cannot be employed in metropolitan areas where unemployment is above 8.5 percent barring special exemptions from the Secretary of Homeland Security. Employers cannot fire American workers 90 days before or after the hiring of guest workers.\nA new federal bureau, the Immigration and Labor Market Research Bureau, would be charged with determining worker shortages and adjusting those caps accordingly to align with the state of the national labor market, but would not be able to increase the cap above 200,000 a year. Its director would be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, and it would have to present construction employment data every three months and deliver an annual report recommending improvements to immigration programs. It would get $20 million to start and will otherwise be funded by employer fees for participating in the program, and \u201cother fees related to the hiring of alien workers.\u201d\nConstruction companies would be limited to 15,000 workers a year or a three percent of total visas, whichever is lower.\nHowever, a \u201csafety valve\u201d would also be put in place whereby companies could hire guest workers in excess of the cap, provided they pay them higher wages.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1cu48w", "selftext": "I the anger directed against those in the 1% is misplaced to an extent but it is a complicated issue.  The fundamental issue with the 99% is that income inequality has started to grow dramatically since the 70's.  Basically in the late 70's the top 1% held about 8% of the total wealth of the nation.  More recently they hold around 20% of the total wealth.  This is largely the result of lower tax rates and general deregulation.  OWS think that this distribution is unfair and that there should be a more even split of the pie.   So that is kind of the backdrop of the issue from a thematic perspective.  \n\nI think that the real anger comes in when you look at the political/historical circumstances.  After the recession hit the big political movement of the hour was the tea party.  The tea party platform was pretty much the repackaged right wing of the republican party.  So tax cuts, more deregulation, less government control, and deficit hawking were on the agenda (ignoring the social issues for now).  From the OWS perspective this was kind of problematic.  OWS are not big believers in trickle down economics.  They saw tax cuts aimed towards the rich and targeting of security net programs and increased deregulation.  These things were viewed as having a disproportionate impact on the poor and working class while benefiting the rich.  Deregulation is a particular problem.  Whereas the Tea Party narrative blames big government for the economic crisis, OWS looks at the problem and sees banks and investors who were wildly irresponsible and deregulated causing the housing crash.  Here is where I think there is a degree of scapegoating of the bankers/wall street.  The OWS narrative places a large degree of fault with Wall Street for the collapse.  \n\nAlso problematic to OWS is the Tea Party itself.  They are their political opponents and viewed as trying to prioritize the welfare of the rich over that of the poor.  The Koch brothers make this issue much more hostile.  They of course are the billionaires behind the tea party.  The OWS movement sees their money in particular as being a corrupting influence on politics.  In general, this fits with their broader narrative that the rich have too much while the poor have too little.  The fact that the Kock brothers are pretty douchey really goes a long way towards the reaction against the rich instead of just policies that cause income inequality.  Things like lobbying their workers to vote for certain candidates looks really bad to OWS.  Furthermore the Koch's anti-labor initiatives seem to fit the narrative that OWS built around them, \"Greedy Billionaires who treat workers like shit and are trying to use their money to influence politics to make themselves richer at the expense of workers.\"  So because the Koch brothers are seen as so slimy there is a general distrust of money in politics so when big companies make political statements they are very distrustful especially if it seems to screw over their workers.  Papa Johns would be an example of this.  But I like the movement to a certain extent have been sidetracked by how shitty certain billionaires can be which leads to the more aggressively anti-1%ers out there.  \n\nEdit: some cool income inequality statistics: http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~saez/saez-UStopincomes-2011.pdf", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "1000facedhero", "id": "t1_c9k5ngo", "parent_id": "t3_1cu48w", "score": 5, "retrieved_on": 1431471672, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9k5ngo", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366618470", "distinguished": null, "ups": 5}

However, this means that one should not make it harder for people to exercise their rights without a damn good reason.  In person voter fraud simply is not a problem because it doesn't happen very often.  If there was large scale in person voter fraud this might be a good idea.  You need forms of identification to register to vote so there is no real problem with people who shouldn't vote voting it is only impersonation that this law protects against.  So there is no real problem to be solved.  And we would know if there was a problem because turnout among registered voters is so high during presidential elections it exceeds 90% in many states.\n\nThat brings me to the drawbacks.  First of all it is expensive as hell.  Making somebody pay for an ID to vote is rightly considered a poll tax which is expressly forbidden by the 24th amendment.  So that means that the IDs have to be free for everybody.  That is not cheap at all.  More importantly voter id language generally requires that an id be valid.  This means that the ID must have the current address at which one is registered to vote on it.  Very mobile populations such as young people do not update their license every time they move I know I don't.  This presents a barrier to voting and also creates huge lines for provisional ballots which deter even more people from voting.  The elderly who no longer drive either no longer have drivers licenses or fail to update them.  Similarly the blind tend to lack drivers licenses for obvious reasons and have a tough time getting to DMVs. to get their licenses.  People from poorer intercity communities who again do not drive do not have licenses.  Often DMVs in rural areas are not open on a daily basis or for convenient hours.  Some counties have DMV's that are only open once a month.  This provides a substantial impediment to people who would otherwise be able to vote.\n\nSo the TLDR; voter ID is expensive, and makes it very hard for certain people to vote but doesn't actually solve any problems.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "mellowizz", "id": "t1_c8zogzr", "parent_id": "t1_c8ziqcs", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431655588, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; registered voters is so high during presidential elections it exceeds 90% in many states.\n\nI think you overestimate turnout, but your point about voter fraud being low is accurate as far as I have read.

They blamed ACORN but turns out that there were voter registration folks by the Republicans that only registered Republicans and would throw out Democrats.\nThe problem with state-issued IDs turning into a poll tax is a real concern.

The people who publish peer reviewed papers on the subject are in agreement.  \n\n&gt;That's a common fallacy - one person won't change anything, but systemics will.\n\nThat is not a fallacy.  Systemic change in this case is about changing incentive structures, regulatory policies etc. This is distinct from every one person changing their habits.  The goal is to get every person to change their habits but it is substantially more than that.  Also just pointing out that this really only applies to activists and not the actual scientists who do the work so the point is mostly moot about the quality of their science being suspect because of their actions.\n\nRegarding leading by example, that isn't an actual policy solution.  I'm not really sure when \"leading by example\" was ever considered a policy solution to any meaningful problem. \n\n&gt; guess know we just have to listen to our \"betters\", right? I mean, when the systemic change comes and we're all living in our apartments with rolling blackouts and limited food and a degraded lifestyle, they're then going to join us? Or do these new aristocrats get to keep their luxuries?\n\nThis is not really an argument but just rhetoric.  Do experts actually have knowledge about problems that the lay public does not?  Yes.  Does that mean that by listening to them it makes them some kind of aristocracy and betters? No that is just hyperbolic and not constructive at all.  Also since when did systemic change to deal with global warming turn into some kind of dystopian future?

Societal relationships with religion are not necessarily linear and have deep ties to culture and historical events which can be very random.   In addition, presidential candidates are highly dependent on the people involved.  There would need to be a decent pool of candidates to draw upon, currently there is 1 non-affiliated member of congress not a huge pool to draw from.  Part of that problem is simple geography, atheists are not as clustered as other minority groups.  Whereas broadly they tend to reside more often in the west and northeast within each region they tend to be more spread out.  On an anecdotal level when you are in a city you don't tend to recognize atheist areas of town like you would ethnic, racial or even sexual minority areas.  This hurts chances for atheists actually getting elected to elected positions on their way to becoming a presidential candidate.  Realistically it could be a while.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;Specifically, would this allow the possibility of third parties being a viable option for presidential politics?\n\nGenerally speaking third party candidates are not viable because of the way coalitions are formed in US politics.  Unlike a proportional representation system where coalitions are formed after an election between different parties, coalitions are formed before elections within parties.\n\n2 states actually do proportion electoral votes in this manner.  Nebraska and Maine.  Only Nebraska in 08 has actually split the votes.  Coincidentally, that district (Omaha) was promptly gerrymandered to prevent it from happening again and state republicans attempted to do away with the vote splitting system.  One affect you would see is a particularly viscous form of gerrymandering.  State borders cannot be redrawn so the problem is moot currently but obviously districts can be.  In addition it would change swing state dynamics.  Swing states would no longer be as important.  Campaigning would be done mostly in large cities all over the US because they tend to have more than one electoral vote and it is more efficient that way.  In general though it would lead to a much less accountable system because of gerrymandering concerns.  Actual voting would have less value because elections would be much more dependent on drawing lines on maps by lawmakers than by actual voting.", "id": "t1_c86sivy", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "1000facedhero", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_17m6rv", "score": 5, "retrieved_on": 1431138321, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_17m6rv", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c86sivy", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1359617666", "ups": 5, "distinguished": null}
