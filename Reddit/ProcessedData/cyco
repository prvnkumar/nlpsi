I'll be going back to school in the fall to get a master's degree.\n\nThere's a lot of good advice in this thread already \u2013 internships are key, as is networking. \n\nA few more specific tips:\n\n- Your school likely has a Government Relations office. If possible, get to know your school's lobbyists and try to volunteer in their office. At my school they were great about getting to know students, taking us on trips to the capital and D.C., and putting us in contact with alumni.\n\n- If you identify with either major party, even broadly, get involved in College Democrats/Republicans. Not only is it good experience, but the students who graduate a year or two ahead of you will be able to help you out down the road. \n\n- Wherever you intern, and in your first job, make it count. Work hard and stand out. Get to know the paid staff. Offer to take them out to lunch or coffee to discuss their jobs and how they got where they are. I did this in my first job *and was not turned down once.* Build up a database of contacts -- keep an Excel or Word document of everyone you interact with significantly and their contact information. My first job was temporary (as many political jobs are), but by getting to know people I was able to transition into another position fairly easily.\n\n- Relatedly, keep in contact with people after you're done with your internship. Many students feel too self-conscious/awkward to email people out of the blue, but DO IT. Again, literally every single person I've asked for help has responded positively. People love talking about themselves, they love feeling important, and they love feeling helpful. Plus, in politics, you never know when the  lowly intern you help out early on will be important in his own right a few years down the road, so it's in their self-interest to be nice to you.

(On House of Cards, Democrats have the majority, in real life the Republicans do.)\n\n- Majority/Minority Leader: These are the leaders of the respective parties' coalitions in the House. The Majority Leader is *technically* the head of majority party, but in reality is second-in-command to the Speaker. Meanwhile, the Minority Leader is actually the head of their party, and in addition is the first choice to become Speaker if the minority party succeeds in taking the majority of seats. (Nancy Pelosi and John Boehner were both Minority Leader before being elected Speaker, for example.)\n\n- Majority/Minority Whip: The Whip is in charge of \"whipping\" votes on bills, amendments, confirmations, and anything else that comes before the House. They work to enforce party loyalty as much as possible in order to present unified support or opposition to a measure. This is especially important on close bills, as one or two votes can mean the difference between passage and failure.\n\n(Kevin Spacey plays the Majority Whip on House of Cards. The Majority Whip is also high up in the chain of command, answering only to the Speaker and Majority Leader.)\n\nChair - Every bill in the House flows through its various [committees](http://www.house.gov/committees/). The chair of a committee has enormous influence over which bills pass and which don't. In fact, a bill can easily \"die\" in committee if the chair refuses to bring it up for a vote.\n\nChairs are usually appointed by the Speaker and answer to the party leadership. Chairmanship is generally gained by seniority on a committee, though this has become less common in recent years.\n\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1a1cby", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "No problem.

When the country first started, we only had two parties, and they basically did describe their ideologies \u2014 Federalist and Anti-Federalist. \n\nHowever, describing what you're against doesn't sound as good as what you're for. So, the anti-Federalist party essentially morphed into the Democratic-Republicans. While you're right that no American party is or was openly monarchist, the Federalists were in favor of a more centralized federal government and a stronger executive, which their detractors used to accuse them of actually wanting an American monarchy. \n\nFederalists also tended to be concentrated in \"elite\" urban areas. So it made sense to name the party allegedly of the people the Democratic-Republicans. Over time it was shortened to just \"Democrats.\" \n\nThe Republican Party has its origins in the breakup of the Whig party, which was essentially a liberal faction similar to its British counterpart. The anti-slavery faction of the Whigs formed their own party and called it Republican. I don't quite know why, but I can imagine that putting something anti-slavery right in the name would have been a turnoff to a lot of voters. \n\nNow, the names today are somewhat ironic: Democrats tend to support a stronger central government and have more in common with the Lincoln-era Republicans, while modern Republicans support states' rights and have become the party predominantly of white, rural areas.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "- So when you say \"the budget situation,\" what exactly do you mean? Many people confuse the debt and the deficit, so figure out which one (or both) you want to address. The deficit is the difference between revenues and expenses *per fiscal year* \u2013 in other words, how much debt (or surplus) the government takes on in one year. The debt is all of the money the government owes overall. \n\n- Some would argue that deficit reduction shouldn't be a priority at all during a prolonged economic downturn. Paul Krugman of the New York Times is a notable example. But that's a separate issue.\n\n- Anyway, The New York Times has done some awesome interactive graphics for the past few years detailing exactly where federal spending is going. [Here is the latest one for 2013.](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/02/13/us/politics/2013-budget-proposal-graphic.html) If you google you can find past years. \n\n(Keep in mind those numbers are for the president's *proposed* budget, which is usually quite different than what Congress adopts, but it should give you a general idea to start with.)\n\n- [This](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/federal-budget-process/budgetprocess.pdf) infographic explains how the budget is actually passed through Congress.\n\n- The [Office of Management and Budget](http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals) has a lot of information on historical budgets. For reference, \"receipts\" means money taken in through taxes and \"outlays\" means money spent by the government. So if you want to compare the ways the budget has changed since 2000, look at [\"Table 3.1\u2014Outlays by Superfunction and Function: 1940\u20132017,\"](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist03z1.xls) and take note of which figures have changed the most from 2000-2012. (Hint: healthcare, mostly Medicare, is *huge*.)\n\n- As for ideas for reducing the deficit, there are a lot of ideas out there. The Simpson-Bowles Commission is currently the hot proposal in Washington, so look into that. Then read as many criticisms as you can, from both right and left, to understand what others would do differently. \n\n- Some other places to start: Center for American Progress (left-leaning think tank), Heritage Foundation (right-leaning think tank), House Progressive Caucus (liberal Democrats), Republican Study Committee (conservative Republicans), all of which have their own deficit/debt reduction plans. \n", "id": "t1_c8i5z06", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "cyco", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c8i6w9c", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "partial_relevance", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c8i5z06", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431345908, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I was talking about both deficit and debt when referencing what to do about the \"budget situation\".

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_17igbk", "selftext": "OK, I actually used to work in the Ohio legislature, so I can offer some advice.\n\nFirst, come up with your idea well in advance. If you are serious about this, passing a bill is an incredibly intensive effort that takes several months at the very least, and often several years. \n\nYou will need to do a lot of research \u2013 what is the current policy in Ohio? What have other states done that is an improvement? Who will benefit from the bill? Why is this an urgent issue that demands your legislators' attention? \n\nI recommend an issue that affects you personally in some way. That makes for a much more compelling story, and gives people a reason to listen to you specifically over the many others competing for the legislature's attention. No offense, but as a high schooler (I assume?) you do not have the policy expertise to demand attention like an elected officials, professor, business owner, etc.\n\nSo \u2013 what have you tried to do, or may want to do in the future, that is hampered by state law? Start a business? Start a school club? The Ohio Revised Code is a vast and multi-faceted beast. Asking here for ideas is a start, but you're unlikely to get bill ideas specific to Ohio. I suggest talking to people in your community for better ideas, and think big! Set up meetings with your principal, district superintendent, mayor, county commissioner, anyone who may be helpful. People in the public realm are always happy to meet with passionate young people. If you identify with a particular political party, go to their local meetings as well. \n\nOne thing you do **not** have to do is actually write the bill. A nonpartisan research agency called the Legislative Service Commission drafts all actual bill language in Ohio. Very few people have the expertise to make sure potential laws fit comfortably into the Revised Code and will withstand court challenges.\n\nThen comes the hard part. Bills are not proposed directly to committees in Ohio. They must be introduced by individual legislators and later referred to committee. Therefore you must sell **your** representative and/or senator on the idea. (It is highly unlikely that legislators from outside your district will agree to meet with you, but that depends on other factors.)\n\nA few logistical tips first. The General Assembly does not meet on weekends, and very few legislators are in Columbus during this time. It will probably be easier to try to arrange a meeting with your local legislator during the week before or after school. Many legislators also hold town hall meetings, \"office hours\" at a library or coffee shop, or other events where you can meet them in person. You can get information on these events from their legislative office in Columbus.\n\nAnother option is find out what legislative initiatives your representative/senator is already proposing that you agree with, and offer to find ways to help.\n\nAnd for some practical political advice \u2013 the Republican Party currently has overwhelming majorities in both chambers (as well as the governor's office). Any idea you propose must be friendly to the Republican platform.\n\nTo help with this, don't forget to read, read, read! Check the \"state politics\" sections of major Ohio newspapers (Dispatch, Plain Dealer, etc.) regularly. It helps immensely to know the major players and their policy priorities. Thomas Suddes is one of the best writers on Statehouse politics, look up his columns to start.\n\nFinally, I will say that there is always strength in numbers. I know you probably want to get this done on your own, but every bill that passes the General Assembly has coalitions behind it \u2013 unions, trade groups, charity groups, any group you can think of. Since you're in school, something that affects students is a good bet. Get a few friends to help, call yourselves \"[Your Town] Students for [Issue],\" and you have a lot more weight than just one individual.\n\nAs you can see, this whole process is a lot of work! You have to find an idea you're really passionate about and be prepared to stick with it. Best of luck.\n\nedit: Forgot to mention \u2013 the Council of State Governments and the National Conference of State Legislatures are two national organizations with tons of policy ideas for state legislators.

These movements arose in reaction to the extreme conservatism of Orthodox Judaism, so it is somewhat natural that the adherents of these sects would be more liberal. \n\nSecond, I think the value of *tikkun olam* may shed some light. Roughly translated, it's a phrase that means \"repairing the world,\" and it kind of summarizes the values I mentioned above. In my Jewish upbringing, there was a strong emphasis on repairing the wrongs of the world and leaving a better place for your children. As another poster commented, Jews have almost always lived in tight-knit communities and generally don't see anything wrong with using government action to improve the community, which essentially is the core of modern liberalism. \n\nSo, speaking very generally, *tikkun olam* + communitarian politics = voting Democratic. This may also help explain why Jews have generally taken more to socialism/Communism than most other groups, whether through philosophers such as Marx (though he wasn't religious), support of the Soviet Union, or the Israeli *kibbutz*. \n\nFinally, the Jewish history of being the outsider has, I think, led to an increased sympathy with marginalized groups.
