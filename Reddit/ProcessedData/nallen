Children of lesbian mothers:\n \u2022Are more likely to be currently cohabiting\n \u2022Are almost 4 times more likely to be currently on public assistance\n \u2022Are less likely to be currently employed full-time\n \u2022Are more than 3 times more likely to be unemployed\n \u2022Are nearly 4 times more likely to identify as something other than entirely heterosexual\"\n\n\"At one time, defenders of homosexual parents not only argued that their children do fine on psychological and developmental measures, but they also said that children of homosexuals \"are no more likely to be gay\" than children of heterosexuals. That claim will be impossible to maintain in light of this study. It found that children of homosexual fathers are nearly 3 times as likely, and children of lesbian mothers are nearly 4 times as likely, to identify as something other than entirely heterosexual.
