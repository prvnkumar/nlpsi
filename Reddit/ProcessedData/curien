I never said or implied anything about 'choice' (more on that below). \n\nThe basis of the OP's assessment (one that I agree with and stated was from a general liberal POV) is that the low-wage employees aren't getting enough money to live on, and from our POV, someone has to pay to bring them up to the level of what a living wage would provide (aka the poverty line). \n\nThat assessment and need to solve the problem exists regardless of what's in the heads of employees or employers. The political decisionmakers make an opinion-based judgment informed by their POV (that being, working people deserve income/resources on par with a living wage), and how those decisionmakers deliver on it is dependent upon the political landscape. Motivations of employees and employers don't factor into the political decision that was made (to go the route of government support to the underpaid employee that in effect amounts to employer subsidies, rather than requiring a higher minimum wage). \n\nSo, the whole concept of choice didn't factor into that paragraph. Even the decision-makers, did they really choose, or instinctively follow the path of least resistance? (IMO, the latter)\n\nAnd further, the talk of 'choice'... people in general, from top to bottom, take what they can get, grab what they can, or do what they're compelled to do; the role of thought comes after the impulse to take/grab/do, as rationalization or justification. Considering a level of predetermination by way of environment (upbringing, circumstances in the present) and biology (genetics, instincts), I just don't see much room left for choice, on any level. So there was little display of choice by any actor in my answer. *(Note, this opinion on 'choice' is divorced from the modern political spectrum as there's implications within it that would have me branded as an awful person by present-day liberals and conservatives)*.

You lay out the scenario from the perspective of someone looking to vote strategically (\"but it doesn't affect A's ability to win over B at all\") in order to say it forces you to vote strategically. So what? The more important issue is if the voting system induces people to vote strategically (i.e. dishonestly), not whether strategic voting is effective. The better voting system minimizes the number of people who would benefit by voting dishonestly and your scenario doesn't indict approval voting on that count.

The only drawback is it's marginally more complicated (though still less complicated than the alternative vote) and cannot be implemented on existing ballots.\n\n&gt; I already explained the problem with a system that lacks the expression of relative preference.\n\nYou did not explain why *relative* preference was so important to a good voting system, as opposed to where the candidates fall with respect to the acceptable/unacceptable line (what I call absolute preference).

All that matters is which candidates you prefer (perhaps with a mechanism for expressing the degree of preference) more than the others... I.e., what matters is expressing your preference of those candidates relative to each other. Where they stack on an absolute scale is completely extraneous.\n\nLet's back up a moment. The issue is not maximally expressing oneself.

The issue is whether the winner selected by the election system minimizes the number of people upset with the result, by some measure.\n\nAbsolute preferences *do* matter when it comes to the line between acceptable and unacceptable candidates. Suppose your candidate preferences are A &gt; B &gt; C. What does this tell us? It doesn't tell us if you'd be happy with both A and B while unhappy with C, or whether A is the *only* non-nazi candidate, or whether you like all of them and are ranking them by handsomeness. This data is important to the question of whether you'd be unhappy with the result, but the alternative suppresses this information. With approval voting you can indicate which candidates you'd be pleased to have elected, and with range voting you have even more resolution with which to express relative preferences on top of that. That's a more realistic picture of the situation. And I maintain, as with my last comment, that the line between acceptable/unacceptable is more important than relative rankings when it comes to US politics. Most people just don't know enough about the differences between candidates that fall in the same ideological category, but they know a lot about which ideologies they prefer over others.

That's a more realistic picture of the situation. And I maintain, as with my last comment, that the line between acceptable/unacceptable is more important than relative rankings when it comes to US politics. Most people just don't know enough about the differences between candidates that fall in the same ideological category, but they know a lot about which ideologies they prefer over others. One way to look at approval or range voting is it allows you to vote for ideological groupings rather than individuals.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ceft1rr", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1388701845", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "parent_id": "t1_cee76cm", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1427892185, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ceffw30", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1388669010", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cee5h0o", "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1427915911, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; which is no better than our current situation\n\nNo, it's a vast improvement over our current situation in which people are forced to vote exclusively for the least-bad candidate among the only two viable ones. The real answer to the small issue you bring up is *range voting*, which is an elaboration of approval voting in which you assign scores to candidates (such as 0 - 10) to express how much you approve of them. In your scenario, one might give A a 10 and B a 7, and everyone else 0.\n\n&gt; If you judge that A has a good chance of winning, you vote for just A. If you judge that A has a poor chance relative to B, you vote for A and B\n\nYou have this basically reversed. If A is the clear favorite over B there's no problem in expressing your approval of both A and B, no matter how they're both doing in comparison with everyone else. If A is expected to lose to B, and B is the overall favorite to win, you'd vote for just for A. If A is expected to lose to B, and B is no sure shot, then you'll vote for A and B. Notice, now, under no scenario do you wish you voted for someone else upon seeing the results (to the extent the projections were accurate). Contrast with our current system, in which Nader voters in 2000 probably wished they voted for Gore instead. Strategic voting is much less a problem if it leads to no regrets.\n\n&gt; It doesn't express relative preference\n\nWhat's so great about relative preference? There's a trade-off between expressing relative preference and absolute preference (except if we introduce range voting there's no trade off at all). The political preferences of most voters is more closely aligned to the absolute preference side of that dichotomy. Try asking a casual voter who their favorite senators are; they'll likely list a few senators in their ideological neighborhood without a well-formed idea of which one is most favorite, second most favorite, etc. This reality is more tuned to approval voting than any preference-focused system.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1u3184", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cee76cm", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1388512301", "ups": 4, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1u3184", "selftext": "This is the correct answer.

De-institutionalization, as it was called, was both good and bad. For one thing, we used to keep a lot of people in institutions who could care for themselves or live in the community with proper supports.

Even the wealthiest people in America have regular income and capital gains that they need to pay taxes on. The question we're answering here involves how the wealthy avoid paying the same taxes everybody else pays on their income.\n\nThe answer is that they pay taxes--they just pay LOWER taxes when they can. The old maxim goes \"only two things in life are certain: death and taxes.\" The wealthy aren't exempt from that. But if the implication from reading the tax code is that you can EXPECT to pay 40% of your enormous income to taxes, and you shuffle things around so you only pay 20%, then for all intents and purposes, you made money. As someone who is deeply interested in tax reform, people thinking that paying SOMETHING to the federal government shows that they're equally treated is a lot of the problem with the tax code.\n\nAs to your deferral of taxes argument, that is in fact a fifth \"loophole\" that the wealthy can take advantage of. Kicking the can down the road through continual reinvestment allows you to reinvest an initial loan to outpace the rate of taxation--in effect never paying taxes. Yes, technically the value of that initial loan will come due, but a human's lifespan is only so long. This is why the cynical among us roll our eyes when the wealthy cry about the size of estate tax--people who avoided paying taxes on enormous investments and assets for decades are transparently attempting to keep this rolling-reinvestment scheme going *between generations*.

And this is in an ideal world where there aren't 10+ contractors and countless subcontractors working on different parts of the same project.\n\nBased on talking to someone who has developed websites for health insurance companies, even 1 year was not enough time. Connecting to all those different insurance companies was always going to be a nightmare. Between the colossal scope of the project, time/budget constraints, and apparently inadequate/inept project management, it was doomed to fail.\n\nAlso wanted to add the lovely tale of Idaho, who said they would create their own exchange until *August 2013* when they realized they could not get it done in time.

They just need some way to prove to all of the rest of us that they're right. People like the federal government because it's what we're used to. It's *easy* and *reliable*. But if they can get us used to the idea that the federal government is *unreliable* (say, if it's under constant threat of shutdown), we'll be more and more willing to have our states run important programs.

But it's a matter of appearance, not biology.\n\nThere is a constitutional amendment in the US that protects against discrimination based on national origin (a detail of one's birth over which one has no control). Once a person goes through the legal process to become a US citizen, that person is 100% a US citizen, and treating them otherwise (by the government, at least) *is* a violation of their fundamental rights under the 14th Amendment.\n\nIf you're not the government, you're *legally allowed* to treat them differently in many ways, but is it *morally right* to? Why are we so willing -- *encouraging* even -- of people changing their nationality, but not their gender?\n\nIt seems to me that you are confusing the present tense with the past tense. No one can change what they *were*, but we can change what we *are*. A man born a Norwegian citizen will always have been born a Norwegian citizen. But if he emigrates to China and becomes a Chinese citizen, *he is now a Chinese citizen*. What he *was* is of historical relevance, but it does not limit what he *is*.\n\nLooking at my drivers license, there's only two pieces of biographical information that are immutable and not self-reported: sex and date of birth. I can change my name; I can change my address; I can surgically alter my height (or I could naturally grow or shrink) or my eye color (and those details are self-reported in any case). DOB is a historical detail that is used as a convenient substitute for age (which is impractical to list because it is *continuously* in flux). That leaves sex alone as a non-historical aspect that some believe shouldn't be changeable, and I just don't see any justification for singling it out. (Or you could argue that the \"sex\" field on the DL lists a historical detail, but what use is that? There are no different rules for male and female drivers. As with height and eye color, it is there to assist with identification, which is best served by listing the *current* status.)\n\n&gt;people discriminate based on gender: they laugh at men in dresses, and deride women in suits\n\nSo what? People do it, so we have to put up with it? They used to laugh at black people who wanted to learn to read or to vote. I don't understand what meaningful point you think you're making, here.\n\n&gt;Conversely, if a man wants to have a baby - he cannot. No amount of cosmetic surgery, vocal surgery, hormone therapy, haircuts or wardrobes will change that. It is a biological fact. \n\nIs the ability to have a baby a requirement to being a woman?
