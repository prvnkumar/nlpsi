While it's healthy for a campaign for the candidate to be assured of their rightness, realistically any campaigning this early in a candidate's career is largely to establish name recognition, and not to win seats. When campaigning, always consider the long game, not just the immediate election.\n\n\n2: **\"By running, do I hurt my cause, or advance it?\"**\n\nIt sounds like you already are aware of this question, just by the fact that you've dropped out of the primary to avoid a destructive race. Too many household-name politicians have ran without asking themselves this question usually causing problems for their platform. Look back to the 2012 Republican Presidential Primary, there were too many candidates for too few positions; could you realistically tell the differences in policy positions from Michelle Bachmann and Rick Santorum? Probably not. \n\n3: **\"Will I have a better chance next cycle?\"**\n\nNot all elections are created equal, some are easier than others. Some of the main things to consider, would you be running against an incumbent? Incumbents are very hard to beat in general elections. Would you be succeed a member of your own party? If the incumbent is from your party and is retiring, it will be almost always easier for you to keep that seat in the same party. Are the demographics in my district changing? A growing immigrant population, a large retirement community or even a large factory closing can heavily influence the voting characteristics of a district. These changes are not hard to predict, and may play to your advantage better next cycle, as opposed to this one. \n\n4: **\"Will I have the money to run twice?\"**\n\nA big part of any campaign is fundraising. But your first campaign is different; you must build a sizable network of donors to keep you political ambitions alive. If you've been tapped by a campaign committee of either major party, even better. The network of campaign donors is your most important asset as a candidate, even between elections. Like a muscle, it will atrophy without use. Always keep even the smallest donors informed and solicit feedback whenever possible. But manage those contributions carefully! If your first campaign runs out of money, what you're saying to your supporters was that they were wrong to support you. If you can't manage a campaign, how can you manage an elected office?\n\n5: **\"Do I want to run?\"**\n\nRunning for office is more work than a full time job. Seven day weeks, Eighteen-plus hours days. For the handful of months before an election, campaigning isn't your job, it's your whole life. Not many people can make that kind of a commitment, either physically, mentally or financially, so you have to know if you are one of them. You have to want it. And you have to show other people that you want it. Sure, it might be nice to be a lawmaker, voting on issues with John Boehner, filibustering with Wendy Davis, scheming with [Frank Underwood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cards_%28U.S._TV_series%29) or defending your principles with [Mr. Smith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Smith_Goes_to_Washington), but they earned the privilege to do those things with their time and effort, and many people don't realize that.", "id": "t1_cdngqxn", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "AnInfiniteAmount", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1rhlsb", "score": 5, "retrieved_on": 1428500333, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1rhlsb", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdngqxn", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1385483859", "ups": 5, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdnttd7", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "serendipitybot", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1rhlsb", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428494092, "controversiality": 0, "body": "This submission has been randomly featured in /r/serendipity, a bot-driven subreddit discovery engine.

They both produce one member per a geographic district, and \"waste\" the votes of both voters who did not vote for the winning candidate (they have no representation) and voters who voted for the winning candidate in surplus of what they needed to win (they have no impact on the results.) \n\nBoth FPP and Instant Runoff Voting are \"Winner Take All\" systems. \n\nAs for the really good argument as to why, [I actually wrote a book on the subject.](http://www.amazon.com/Importing-Democracy-Brian-Boyko-ebook/dp/B00G8TC4HY) which compares New Zealand before and after proportional representation.  Pre-1996, New Zealand had a two party system where both parties passed policies that favored the rich business owners in the country.  In 1996, they moved to MMP, and under MMP, they have a multi-party system.  Additionally, with multiple parties, there is much more compromise and debate before legislation is passed.  \n\nAustralia is interesting because it's the only case where you have a true \"control group\" if you will.  Australia has a bicameral legislature - the House is elected via Winner Take All (IRV) but the Senate is elected through Single Transferable Vote (a semi-proportional system that uses ranked-choice-voting.)  \n\nThere are more independents (percentagewise) in the Senate than in the House.  The House leans to the right, the Senate to the left.  Women and minorities do not reach parity with the population, but they come far closer in the Senate. (The House is 25% women, the Senate, 40%.)  \n\nThe biggest argument for proportional representation, however, is that especially using STV, voters can hold politicians accountable instead of having to vote for the lesser of two evils.  I'm working to try to add proportional representation to the Texas State Party Platform.  \n\n\n\n\n", "id": "t1_cdetfcd", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "BrianBoyko", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cdelfbl", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428651730, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdetfcd", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384499082", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

There's a number of reasons I've settled on this system. 1) It's been used in a number of countries, so it's been shown to work. 2) It does NOT require party lists (which are anathema to Americans) - you always vote for a *person.*, 3)  The ballot is identical to Instant Runoff Voting. \n\nC) Momentum in the states is good, but states are mandated by the federal government to use Winner Take All.  2 USC sec. 2. \n\nThe reason for this is actually a good one - back in the days of segregation, a number of states were considering a move to \"at-large\" voting, meaning the entire state would select congressmen for the whole state.  As you can imagine, you'd end up with white-majority segregated states election all-white members to Congress.  \n\nWinner Take All was an improvement, but even Winner Take All has problems with racially-based gerrymandering, like in Texas, to this day. \n\nSo you'd need to get an amendment to 2 USC sec 2c first which would basically allow Single Transferable Vote to be used as an alternative voting method to Winner Take All. \n\nTHEN you can go ahead and start petitioning the states - determination of which system to use would then be a 10th Amendment issue.

I was talking about changing from a first-past-the-post system where whoever gets the most votes (but not necessarily a majority of votes) wins. Several states do not use that system, and instead have multiple rounds of elections.\n\nI think you are asking about proportional representation, in which case you are right, no state uses that for their members of congress. (2 do for electoral votes). Interestingly enough, the Democratic Party uses proportional representation for their delegates to elect their presidential nominee. It was actually part of why Obama beat Hillary.\n\nIf you want to switch to proportional representation you are going to need a really good argument for why.

They both produce one member per a geographic district, and \"waste\" the votes of both voters who did not vote for the winning candidate (they have no representation) and voters who voted for the winning candidate in surplus of what they needed to win (they have no impact on the results.) \n\nBoth FPP and Instant Runoff Voting are \"Winner Take All\" systems. \n\nAs for the really good argument as to why, [I actually wrote a book on the subject.](http://www.amazon.com/Importing-Democracy-Brian-Boyko-ebook/dp/B00G8TC4HY) which compares New Zealand before and after proportional representation.  Pre-1996, New Zealand had a two party system where both parties passed policies that favored the rich business owners in the country.  In 1996, they moved to MMP, and under MMP, they have a multi-party system.  Additionally, with multiple parties, there is much more compromise and debate before legislation is passed.  \n\nAustralia is interesting because it's the only case where you have a true \"control group\" if you will.  Australia has a bicameral legislature - the House is elected via Winner Take All (IRV) but the Senate is elected through Single Transferable Vote (a semi-proportional system that uses ranked-choice-voting.)  \n\nThere are more independents (percentagewise) in the Senate than in the House.  The House leans to the right, the Senate to the left.  Women and minorities do not reach parity with the population, but they come far closer in the Senate. (The House is 25% women, the Senate, 40%.)  \n\nThe biggest argument for proportional representation, however, is that especially using STV, voters can hold politicians accountable instead of having to vote for the lesser of two evils.  I'm working to try to add proportional representation to the Texas State Party Platform.  \n\n\n\n\n", "id": "t1_cdetfcd", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "BrianBoyko", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cdelfbl", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428651730, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdetfcd", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384499082", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdej4nt", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428655535, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1qhs5g", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdelfbl", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384475962", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdcy8t3", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428656606, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1qhs5g", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdej4nt", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384470424", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

They tend to vote for the top-of-the-ticket, OR they vote based on party.  Ted Cruz won Texas not because 50% of Texas supports him, but because he got 50%+ of the hardcore Republican Primary Voters to vote for him, and 50%+ of Texans will either NEVER vote for any Democrat.\n\nI think a lot of political operatives are too close to the issues to understand how the people think. \n\nPoliticos like you and me think in *issues*.  What is the best way to increase growth while capping inflation.  What is the most efficient way to bring medical care to all Americans?  What is the goal of our foreign policy?  \n\nPeople don't think about these things.  This is for two reasons - first, they know their vote doesn't matter much - we use \"winner take all\" and statistically, over half of those votes are \"wasted.\"  So people don't spend the time to learn about politics, because they feel like they have no say in the outcome of elections, and all learning more about politics will do will make them angry - impotently angry. \n\nWhen they do vote, they vote based on which candidate shares their *values.*  If you are a hard working father of two who makes $80,000 a year, you might lean Republican because the Republican \"brand\" values safety, low taxes, and rewarding hard work.  If you're a single mother making $40,000 a year, you might lean Democrat because the Democratic \"brand\" values women's rights, healthcare, and ensuring a safety net.  Neither one of these are \"wrong\" because values *cannot be* wrong. \n\nUnless your value is to hate gays or whatever. But for the most part...\n\nAnyway, what is happening is that we are starting to see a fundamental shift away from \"values\" to \"motive.\"\n\nThink of it as a pyramid.  Issues are on the tippy top.  They are specific questions with specific answers.  The answer a candidate makes is *based* upon the next lower layer in the pyramid, \"values.\"  If a candidate \"values hard work,\" they're likely to go for work-fare schemes, low taxes, etc. If a candidate \"values prosperity for all\", they're likely to go for social welfare programs, universal healthcare, and a progressive income tax.  \n\nWhat we have, though, under values, in the pyramid, is \"motive.\"\n\nAnd the motive layer is: \"Why do I want the job?  Who am I really working for?\"\n\nThere are good people on both sides of the aisle for whom \"to serve the people\" is still the answer.  But a lot of people have seen service in Congress as a farm league to the higher-paying jobs on K-street.  Not as many as you think - but still too many. \n\nThe problem is that money is so dominant in our elections that our elected officials - if they want to be re-elected or wield any influence within their party - have to continually raise funds.  They must \"always lean towards the green\" and for that reason they make a lot of decisions and spend a lot of time worrying about the issues that concern the 0.05% of Americans who fund campaigns, rather than the issues that affect all of us.  \n\nThere's ways to solve this problem, through citizen-funded elections and electoral reforms which would increase voter engagement by ending \"safe seats\" but the point is - 50%+ of Americans probably don't approve of their congressman.  Hell, I'm not even sure 50% of eligible voters actually vote - and that is not a political apathy borne of laziness but a rational apathy borne of the realization that it doesn't matter who you vote for - it is really money that buys results in Congress.

Solicit supporters through your friends and your family. If you are going to represent people they need to believe in you and in what you are doing and your friends and family are going to need to be on board. Put up Facebook posts, twitter posts, email to party affiliated lists. In fact, start your own email list and add as many people as possible to it. Go to local colleges and try to recruit help from the college dems or republicans. Tell people who volunteer for you to ask their friends to volunteer with them. Get as many people as you can possibly get and don't stop trying to get more. \n  \nHire yourself a campaign manager. For a state office your going to need to raise money. If you aren't good at sales then hire someone who is. You or the campaign manager then need to give the volunteers something to do and manage them while they do it. \n  \nD you want them to make calls based on a script and record data? Do you want them knocking on doors? Do you want them walking around with you in parades or working at campaign hosted events? Give them a purpose. Don't ask them to donate just an hour of their time, ask them \"how much time would you feel comfortable making a few phone calls each week?\" \n  \nRally people together. Make the phone call times a party. Have pizza and soft drinks and all that. Get shirts and buttons and give them to your volunteers. Chart how many calls made or doors knocked on that your volunteers achieved and hand out prizes to anyone who hits certain benchmarks. Have goals, have goals, have goals....then make stretch goals and infinitives those who achieve the stretch goals in any way you feel is appropriate and achievable with the resources you have. \n  \nKeep people organized through Facebook groups. While they are at a central head quarters making calls, or gathering signs to go put out on the road, had them a laptop or iPad and have them join the Facebook group. \n  \nAlways inspire your people. Encourage them. Help them out when they have questions. Gather them, talk to them about your purpose and why what they are doing is so very important. You need people committed and invested. The campaign never gets less busy or less intense as the election draws closer and closer. People get burned out right towards the end when you need them the most. Keep them inspired and keep them believing in what they are doing just as you would inspire the voters to believe their vote is truly making a difference and you are truly the best candidate. \n  \nAlso, message the mods at /r/Politics if you are running a race and submitting links to our site.

Ask for Kendra, I worked with her on direct mail and she was very sharp. People like to say shit like, \"signs don't vote.\" These people don't know what they are talking about. I've seen local and countywide campaigns hinge on signs. Move further up the food chain and they start to matter less.\n\nThe most important place to put your signs is around your opponents home. Keep your opponent nervous as much as possible so they show their temper and do stupid things. Get signs in opinion leaders yards. If you have someone that loves you and wants to help but is to afraid of knocking or making phone calls have them be the sign captain. \n\nIf you need to choose though between a meaningful direct mail program and signs then it's no contest, direct mail is more important. Design wise you want to have some stylistic unity but having your name as large as possible with the office you're seeking is most important. \n\nIf your opponent has someone out stealing your signs, use that story to raise more money. Do you have a campaign plan? If you do and it's a good one then it should tell you how many you need and then you need to get on the phone and raise the money. If you're a candidate looking this up online then you need to get a campaign manager to do this shit. What office are you running for anyway? Hit me up with an direct message with your phone number. \n\nI'm between gigs right now and I've got time to bullshit for a little while tomorrow. I have a few helpful things I could send your way too, spreadsheet templates and campaign plan examples I can send you. If though you're on some quixotic fools errand and you think you can win a race without raising money you should just quit right now.\n\nI'm tired and I'm rambling so I better go to bed. \n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1jd2xe", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cbdx2nn", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1375255167", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "clicked": false, "title": "What's the cheapest place to get campaign signs (in TX/US?)", "media": null, "base10id": 92989202, "id": "t3_1jd2xe", "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 3, "saved": false, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1jd2xe/whats_the_cheapest_place_to_get_campaign_signs_in/", "name": "t3_1jd2xe", "created": 1375236097, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1jd2xe/whats_the_cheapest_place_to_get_campaign_signs_in/", "author_flair_text": null, "author": "BrianBoyko", "created_utc": 1375207297, "distinguished": null, "num_comments": 4, "num_reports": null, "ups": 10}

So you shouldn't mention it at all.\"  \n\n* \"Brian, you're an intelligent, well-spoken, and articulate individual who has a keen grasp of the nuances of complex issues.\"\n* \"But when you explain it, try to do so in 10 words or less.\" \n\n* Politicians don't address any of the issues that me and my friends care about, which is (combined with the fact that voting doesn't actually matter, statistically) why we don't vote.\n* So politicians, seeing that we don't vote, don't address any of the issues that me and my friends care about. Because who wants to actually find out what issues people care about when they can just go for the low-hanging fruit by dealing with the wedge issues that, in all honestly, affect about 0.01% of us.  But that's the 0.01% that votes! \n\nMaybe I just need to do everything wrong.  Discard every scrap of conventional wisdom out there.  Totally reinvent the wheel.  \n\nBecause if you're telling me that I'm going to lose no matter what I do, I might as well shoot for the moon. \n", "id": "t1_cb550ry", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "BrianBoyko", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ig02l", "id": "t1_cb5e97i", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "polit_burro", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ig02l", "selftext": "&gt; people really don't care about gerrymandering.\n\nThen I suppose the question that I should be asking is - how do you get them to care? \n\nHow do I make the connection from systems to pockets and families?  \n\n\"You're opting to pay the fine under Obamacare for not being insured than to pay for health insurance, because you can't afford insurance, but you can afford the fine.  I like Obamacare, and we're better off with it, than without it.  That said, it wasn't want anyone actually wanted.  Public Option was what the people wanted.  Obamacare was only what could get passed, simply because there's more incentive under the current system to raise money from Healthcare lobbyists than there is for giving people access to affordable care.\" \n\n\"Your kid can't get a scholarship because he was convicted of minor marijuana possession when he was 13.

Because it's not in either party's best interest to take the best course of action for the people.  That's what this is all about.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1htuxm", "selftext": "&gt; You live in Texas, a state that's going to turn blue in the next decade. \n\nI do live in Texas, and I believe it will turn Blue by 2020.  \n\nThe reason that I need to act now is because only now will the Texas GOP be amenable to the idea that proportional representation is good for the GOP.  They know that when the Democrats come in, the districts will be re-gerrymandered in favor of the Democratic party. Having done this themselves for the past two decades, the GOP has no cause to complain if that happens.  \n\nHowever, proportional representation provides them with an option to \"hedge\" against that future by preserving that the proportion of votes will be equal to the proportion of people who support their policies, and that even in opposition, they will be able to get some measures passed if they can get the approval of coalition partners. \n\nAs for the Democrats, the Democrats will be able to re-energize the party by making every vote in every district count; a truly competitive Texas.  Additionally, by allowing elements of the Democratic party to break off and form third parties that are only viable under PR, they can start do something they never have in my lifetime: Provide a cohesive, fully articulated plan and vision for where the Democratic party wants to take the state of Texas.  (Currently, if you ask 10 democrats what they stand for, you'll get 11 answers.) \n\n&gt; If, as you state above, you're expecting a bloody primary fight, that makes running a worse idea. You'll just make enemies for no reason. \n\nI actually do *not* expect a bloody primary fight.  I may be running unopposed.  If I'm not running unopposed, I expect the primary fight to be amiable.  I will work to raise the profile of my issues while my opponent raises the profile of his/her name.  If two or more candidates wish to run, I will not.  \n\n&gt; The technical voting stuff doesn't play with the public at all. Bipartisan redistricting commissions, like in Iowa, do work. That may be a better focus.\n\nThe problem is that redistricting doesn't solve the problems inherent to single member district elections (like in TX and the U.S.)  Bipartisan redistricting committees may produce the most fair single member districts, but single member districts **in and of themselves produce none of the disincentive for corruption that the threat of the ballot box is supposed to induce;** furthermore, single member districts may actually encourage corruption.  I'm animating a presentation right now explaining exactly why and how that happens; and it's not a flaw in our national character.  It's mathematics.  \n\nYeah, it doesn't \"play with the public.\"  My chances of winning are damn-near nil; I'll only get the nomination if unopposed, I'll only win the election if my opponent blows up in a major sex scandal.  But dammit, it's never going to \"play with the public\" unless someone goes out there and starts talking about it.  Most state representatives haven't even *heard* of proportional representation.  \n\nAnyway, my last presentation got 90,000 views; the one before that got 470,000, so I'm pretty optimistic that I can get the ball rolling. \n\n&gt; Autism is \"trendy\" now. You can play that to your favor. Even Republicans are all about autistic kids these days.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that \"autistic kids\" eventually become \"autistic adults\" and that we're a viable part of society. Too often, people on the spectrum don't get work they're qualified for - or lose jobs they're qualified for - because their social quirks make people uncomfortable.  These are, in some cases, *brilliant* people who don't get listened to because there's a delay in processing a facial expression like a smile or a frown.  Something like 90% of people with Aspergers (the \"mild\" form of Autism that I have) are unemployed; that number is far, far too high. \n\nAutism isn't something that's just about kids, is what I'm saying.  Yes, kids have it the roughest, because childhood is far more about learning social interaction than anything else.  And it does get better as you grow older.  But there are still challenges out there, and it is important that we start looking for ways that we can take advantage of the brilliance of the misfits.  \n", "id": "t1_cay3zk5", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "BrianBoyko", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cay0lhm", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1430546276, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cay3zk5", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1373271642", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}

They know that when the Democrats come in, the districts will be re-gerrymandered in favor of the Democratic party. Having done this themselves for the past two decades, the GOP has no cause to complain if that happens.  \n\nHowever, proportional representation provides them with an option to \"hedge\" against that future by preserving that the proportion of votes will be equal to the proportion of people who support their policies, and that even in opposition, they will be able to get some measures passed if they can get the approval of coalition partners. \n\nAs for the Democrats, the Democrats will be able to re-energize the party by making every vote in every district count; a truly competitive Texas.  Additionally, by allowing elements of the Democratic party to break off and form third parties that are only viable under PR, they can start do something they never have in my lifetime: Provide a cohesive, fully articulated plan and vision for where the Democratic party wants to take the state of Texas.  (Currently, if you ask 10 democrats what they stand for, you'll get 11 answers.) \n\n&gt; If, as you state above, you're expecting a bloody primary fight, that makes running a worse idea. You'll just make enemies for no reason. \n\nI actually do *not* expect a bloody primary fight.  I may be running unopposed.  If I'm not running unopposed, I expect the primary fight to be amiable.  I will work to raise the profile of my issues while my opponent raises the profile of his/her name.  If two or more candidates wish to run, I will not.  \n\n&gt; The technical voting stuff doesn't play with the public at all. Bipartisan redistricting commissions, like in Iowa, do work. That may be a better focus.\n\nThe problem is that redistricting doesn't solve the problems inherent to single member district elections (like in TX and the U.S.)  Bipartisan redistricting committees may produce the most fair single member districts, but single member districts **in and of themselves produce none of the disincentive for corruption that the threat of the ballot box is supposed to induce;** furthermore, single member districts may actually encourage corruption.  I'm animating a presentation right now explaining exactly why and how that happens; and it's not a flaw in our national character.  It's mathematics.  \n\nYeah, it doesn't \"play with the public.\"  My chances of winning are damn-near nil; I'll only get the nomination if unopposed, I'll only win the election if my opponent blows up in a major sex scandal.  But dammit, it's never going to \"play with the public\" unless someone goes out there and starts talking about it.  Most state representatives haven't even *heard* of proportional representation.  \n\nAnyway, my last presentation got 90,000 views; the one before that got 470,000, so I'm pretty optimistic that I can get the ball rolling. \n\n&gt; Autism is \"trendy\" now. You can play that to your favor. Even Republicans are all about autistic kids these days.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that \"autistic kids\" eventually become \"autistic adults\" and that we're a viable part of society. Too often, people on the spectrum don't get work they're qualified for - or lose jobs they're qualified for - because their social quirks make people uncomfortable.  These are, in some cases, *brilliant* people who don't get listened to because there's a delay in processing a facial expression like a smile or a frown.  Something like 90% of people with Aspergers (the \"mild\" form of Autism that I have) are unemployed; that number is far, far too high. \n\nAutism isn't something that's just about kids, is what I'm saying.  Yes, kids have it the roughest, because childhood is far more about learning social interaction than anything else.  And it does get better as you grow older.  But there are still challenges out there, and it is important that we start looking for ways that we can take advantage of the brilliance of the misfits.  \n", "id": "t1_cay3zk5", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "BrianBoyko", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cay0lhm", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1430546276, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cay3zk5", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1373271642", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t3_1htuxm", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1430548103, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "lawyer", "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cay0lhm", "author_flair_text": "[Attorney/Leg.

There are a lot of solid replies here too, such as advice for finding a team (you'll need a team to win!), although I think you should augment your team by organizing some people who are far from you geographically on Reddit who you can consult (consider a private subreddit and invite people who have given you good advice before, as well as asking question in public subreddits). \n\nSome thoughts to help your journey that aren't covered here: \n\nIf you're focused on STV, look over at [FairVote](http://fairvote.org)'s website, particularly on [Choice Voting](http://www.fairvote.org/how-choice-voting-works) and [Superdistricts](http://www.fairvote.org/list/author/Super_Districts). They're going to be a good resource, especially if you approach them for support on this issue. \n\nThe second bit is this, consider checking /r/Pragmatism out some time.

They will tell you if you will face a likely challenger for the nomination. \n2. These people will be your core group of supporters. In fact, it is from this group that you will likely get most of your campaign team. They know who to talk with, who to avoid, how to raise money, etc. \n3. Their support is critical. \n4. Look up the name of the president of your local committee, then call him or her and ask to meet, away from a full committee meeting. Sit on that person's front porch and have a conversation about what you'd like to do, and ask your questions. \n\nAfter you do that, write me and let me know how things are moving ahead. \n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1htuxm", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_caz3cca", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1373393689", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1htuxm", "id": "t1_cb02kkh", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Captain_Tactical", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1htuxm", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1430512363, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Go to nursing homes.
