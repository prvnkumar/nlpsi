The date was actually pushed to early 2013, meaning that the programmers had ~8 months to develop and test the system. Keep in mind that this system connects to hundreds of different insurance companies, a list of which was also not available until spring 2013.\n\nMany of these state governors were Republicans. It is speculation, but they had a real interest in making the ACA fail.\n\nHealthcare.gov was originally only supposed to be a directory site where you say \"I live in X state\" and it redirects you to the exchange your own state government set up. When a number of (Republican controlled) states decided not to create their own exchanges, it completely changed the federal government's project scope.\n\nI don't think that's the *only* reason it was a disaster, but I think it was an important factor.", "id": "t1_cddjp2q", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "squishykins", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1qiqct", "selftext": "&gt;State governors asked for at least one delay of the deadline for saying whether they would make their own exchange\n\nThis is completely backward from what I remember happening. The Obama administration pushed back the deadline hoping more states would opt to set up their own exchanges if given more time to get approval.\n\nFurther, the guidance that came out from the feds prior to the November deadline was that any state that hadn't submitted a declaration letter would be assumed to use the federal exchange. So according to the administration's own guidance, any delay (regardless of who pushed for it) shouldn't have made the task of creating healthcare.gov any more difficult.", "id": "t1_cddl7yd", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "curien", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1qiqct", "selftext": "It was probably a little bit of both.

HHS granted the extension because they hoped more governors would get on board. It was a dangerous gamble.\n\nAnd it does make it more difficult when there is a delay. How can web developers get started when they don't know which states and health insurance companies are participating? Sure they can make some pretty flow charts but they have to get into the code to get anything real done. And this is in an ideal world where there aren't 10+ contractors and countless subcontractors working on different parts of the same project.\n\nBased on talking to someone who has developed websites for health insurance companies, even 1 year was not enough time. Connecting to all those different insurance companies was always going to be a nightmare. Between the colossal scope of the project, time/budget constraints, and apparently inadequate/inept project management, it was doomed to fail.\n\nAlso wanted to add the lovely tale of Idaho, who said they would create their own exchange until *August 2013* when they realized they could not get it done in time.

I know that the cost of malpractice insurance is also very high, though I am not sure how it compares to similar countries.\n\nOther countries also make greater use of non-doctor health professionals (nurses, nurse practitioners, physicians assistants, nurse midwives, etc.) who have lower education costs, less expertise, and charge lower prices. This is a great savings and a better use of resources for non-complicated issues.\n\nSpecifically referring to birth (which is one of the highest and most common medical expenditures), we spend much, much more than our peer countries. A lot of this is because we push c-sections/induced labor and consider an OBGYN to be the standard. In Europe it is standard for a young woman with no complications to be seen by a nurse midwife and have less medical intervention.\n\nWe also use more prescription drugs (arguably too many) and we pay more for those.
