Get involved with your neighborhood associations or organizations and/or school groups. People won't vote for you or help you with your campaigns if they don't know who you are. \n\n--Get involved in your local party chapters. Whether you are into the Green party, Libertarian, Democrat, Republican, etc. get involved. Those will be the people who help you run a campaign. \n\n--Start small. Run for city council, school board, etc. You can't just jump to a state Rep. or Senator. One person I know did and that was only because he knew a lot of people in the Democratic party. They respected him and when an incumbent was going to retire they asked him to run. \n\n--Don't give up if you lose the first time. The guy I just mentioned didn't win the first time. Actually a lot of people I know in office didn't win the first time. \n\nMy biggest advise is to get into some sort of political classes in college. I was able to get a paid internship at my capital through my Texas government teacher. If you make yourself known to the teachers in your local poli sci department, know your shit, and act like you care they'll be more incline to give you opportunities for internships. \n\nOnce you get the internship try to meet everyone.

It was put in place so that our nation wouldn't get out of hand with our amount of debt holdings, but that hasn't been the case -- every time we get close to the debt ceiling, Congress votes to raise it, making it more of an annoying move to blame things on the president (as explained very well in this [CGP Grey video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIbkoop4AYE)).\n\nIn 2011, the then newly-elected Tea Party candidates in the House of Representatives made a big hullabaloo about not raising the debt ceiling, and got America's S&amp;P credit rating downgraded; the first time that it's ever been below AAA since World War II. Now, with the government shutdown unable to even pass a [CR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuing_resolution), it seems we might actually hit the debt ceiling on October 17, 2013.\n\nIf we did, the effects could be disastrous. I don't say that to sound fear-mongering, but it could fundamentally change the seat of power America currently holds on the global economy. The US would have to continue spending on certain programs (mandatory spending includes programs like Social Security and Medicare), but since we could no longer borrow to make up the rest of our deficit, we would have to cut a MASSIVE amount of non-mandatory social programs. Regardless of what you think about deficit spending, if there was suddenly [$901 billion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_United_States_federal_budget) that people were anticipating one ear that was gone the next, there would be plenty of jobless or poorer people as a result.\n\nBecause of this, many international investors would be encouraged to sell off their US treasury bonds, meaning that interest rates for loans across the US would raise substantially. Even if the government defaulted for two weeks and THEN raised the debt ceiling, the money they would start borrowing again would come at a much higher interest rate. This would also raise inflation\n\nThese two factors would combine into a national market crash akin the one that happened in 2008. Except in 2008, it was the bursting of the housing bubble; this time, it would be the bursting of the US DOLLAR bubble. The US government wouldn't be able to do much about it, since any minor solution they have available (Treasury Sec. Tim Geithner suggested selling some of our gold reserves) would be short-term fixes that would weaken the strength of the dollar in the future. If the crash was substantial enough (and that's a big if, mind you), and if we were downgraded again (permanently), then the dollar could be seen as so weak that the global economy begins to shift away from using the dollar as the reserve currency of the world.\n\nI wouldn't venture to say what would happen in that case. It's the fever dream of some ultra-libertarian types who don't like the US' consolidated power in the global economic community, but it almost impossible to predict since it would be such an unprecedented event within it's historical context.\n\nEDIT: reformatted, added some links.", "edited": 1381288485, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1o16g1", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ccnxdib", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1381286929", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1o16g1", "selftext": "The government needs to borrow to pay interest on the debt.

Once there's nothing left to cut, then we can default. \n\nAgain, everything other than debt service payment is optional... so it seems to me that we won't have a government left by the time we default. See, this is what happens when you take the Constitution out of context. The line saying we must pay our debt was really just part of the thing saying we're never going to pay for the Confederacy's debts, but we'll still pay those still outstanding from before the civil war that were originally incurred by the US.

I was just trying to explain how the Tea Party has claimed such a position of power while the citizens of the US pretty much don't like their ideals. \n\nThe Republicans as a party don't like the Affordable Care Act, however the majority of Republicans are also against a government shutdown. So, while most of them would vote to repeal it they are also not willing to shut the government down in order to do so, hence the reason why people are so upset with the Tea Party. It is largely only Tea Party members who support the shutdown. \n\nMost Americans know that the majority of Republicans are willing to vote for a clean bill to run the government. The reason it hasn't been voted on yet is because Speaker Boehner refuses to introduce. He is siding with the 30 or so Republicans who are really the organizers of the shutdown, many of them being Tea Party representatives. Most people know that this is the case which is why again the Tea Party is getting a lot of flack while moderate Republicans aren't. \n\nTo give you an example I'm from Texas and my 2 senators are Cornyn and Cruz. They are both Republicans. Of course Cruz is the ring leader of the shut down. While Cornyn is willing to vote to repeal the ACA he isn't willing to do it with a government shutdown, or so he's said. So, while my two Republican senators are against the ACA only one of them is for the shut down. \n\nEdit: and to add on to \"Well, I assume the majority of people in the respective electoral districts of Tea Party members in parliament voted for them.\" this statement. From where I sit, which again is in Texas, the majority of us DO NOT like our Tea Party representation. Cruz again is the most extreme Tea Party member coming out of Texas. Cruz won because he successfully beat Dewhurst who is incredibly conservative but Cruz was able to campaign successfully that Dewhurst wasn't a \"real conservative\" and that he was somehow liberal. Again, the reason he won is because voter turnout during these elections is slim to none. During the Cruz/Dewhurst primary only 16% of registered voters actually voted. So again you have a representative that only [16% of registered](http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/texas-legislature/headlines/20100304-Texas-primary-turnout-is-highest-in-4911.ece?nclick_check=1)  Republicans voted for.

Most employers don't give people leave to vote, and some districts have closed early and weekend voting places in an [attempt to prevent people](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/06/opinion/06mon1.html?_r=0) from voting. This is one of the reasons why voter turn out is so low here. \n\nSo, because of all of this we get into situations where extremist members of our Congress backed by a small minority of extremist citizens have been put in the position of power to shut down the government. Most of us do in fact blame the Tea Party. The only way we can truly fix this issue and prevent it in the future is to vote, especially during primaries and especially during the Republican primaries. I am very liberal and will likely never vote for a Republican but I desperately want moderate Republicans to reclaim their party and if it takes me voting in their primaries then I'll do it.

I was just trying to explain how the Tea Party has claimed such a position of power while the citizens of the US pretty much don't like their ideals. \n\nThe Republicans as a party don't like the Affordable Care Act, however the majority of Republicans are also against a government shutdown. So, while most of them would vote to repeal it they are also not willing to shut the government down in order to do so, hence the reason why people are so upset with the Tea Party. It is largely only Tea Party members who support the shutdown. \n\nMost Americans know that the majority of Republicans are willing to vote for a clean bill to run the government. The reason it hasn't been voted on yet is because Speaker Boehner refuses to introduce. He is siding with the 30 or so Republicans who are really the organizers of the shutdown, many of them being Tea Party representatives. Most people know that this is the case which is why again the Tea Party is getting a lot of flack while moderate Republicans aren't. \n\nTo give you an example I'm from Texas and my 2 senators are Cornyn and Cruz. They are both Republicans. Of course Cruz is the ring leader of the shut down. While Cornyn is willing to vote to repeal the ACA he isn't willing to do it with a government shutdown, or so he's said. So, while my two Republican senators are against the ACA only one of them is for the shut down. \n\nEdit: and to add on to \"Well, I assume the majority of people in the respective electoral districts of Tea Party members in parliament voted for them.\" this statement. From where I sit, which again is in Texas, the majority of us DO NOT like our Tea Party representation. Cruz again is the most extreme Tea Party member coming out of Texas. Cruz won because he successfully beat Dewhurst who is incredibly conservative but Cruz was able to campaign successfully that Dewhurst wasn't a \"real conservative\" and that he was somehow liberal. Again, the reason he won is because voter turnout during these elections is slim to none. During the Cruz/Dewhurst primary only 16% of registered voters actually voted. So again you have a representative that only [16% of registered](http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/texas-legislature/headlines/20100304-Texas-primary-turnout-is-highest-in-4911.ece?nclick_check=1)  Republicans voted for. That is an incredibly small percentage of Texans who actually like Cruz. This is the root of our problem.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Absolutely! It would devastate the economy of gangs and organized black market crime. I knew a few drug dealers in Michigan and while a few of them also sold things like heroin, cocaine, and crack I'd say at least 80% of their business was marijuana and that is a low number. \n\nMarijuana is a source of upward mobility for those who seek a life in dealing drugs. You could for example take a chunk of money, say $300, buy some pot at a reasonable price from a friend, then turn around and sell it to your customers at an increased rate with short ounces and grams. Marijuana is to organized crime the way higher education is to the middle class. Though the two are clearly two separate things they both achieve the same end result for those who seek to utilize it, which is upward economic and career mobility. \n\nOnce you are established as a dealer with marijuana and have made a bit of money you can move onto harder drugs that are more expensive and have a high addiction rate. But to do that you need connections, money, and customers. Unless you happen to know the right people the ability to get into say the cocaine or crack game is pretty limited unless you first establish yourself with marijuana. The reason for that is because of how easily it is to sell marijuana. It is a popular substance and one doesn't need to try hard for a client base.  \n\nPeople who sell drugs aren't inherently violent, and many come from poverty and live in poor conditions. Many people who turn to selling drugs see it as their only way to a life of comfort. It is the lack of regulations and legal implications that makes it violent. Say you have 6 drug dealers selling in a city. 5 of them could be perfectly nice people but then the 6th one is unstable. The 6th one decides he is going to make a deal where he wants the money and the drugs, he is going to do this by killing one of the other five. Once that happens the person he kills, his friends and family retaliate, then dealer 6's group retaliates, and on and on and on. Then you have territory disputes and things go sour really quickly. That is why the vast majority of drug dealers all carry guns and are willing to use them. It is a dangerous business because even if the majority of dealers are fine people the few unstable ones can cause tremendous blood shed. \n\nNow, if you take away marijuana you take away most people's ability to get into the game in the first place. You would have a major decrease in drug dealing activity and the sudden collapse of millions (if not billions) of dollars in revenue would tear through local gangs and organized crime. It would be like a major depression in that economic area. \n\nYou'd still have organized crime surrounding hard drugs but the % of the population that uses those types of substances is relatively small. The ability for gangs, say in Chicago, to control entire ares of the city in my opinion would be obliterated. Take away the money you take away the power. \n\nIn fact, it wouldn't surprise me if powerful drug cartels lobby to keep marijuana illegal in the US considering how much money cartels in say Mexico would lose. Legalizing marijuana in America would not only decrease organized crime here but in Mexico as well. \n\nEdit: grammar", "id": "t1_cbkzjxs", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "maowsers93", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1k3f38", "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1429876869, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1376155822, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1k3f38", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cbkzjxs", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1376155435", "ups": 4, "distinguished": null}

US bases are in Japan/Germany in as a result of Soviet containment. Bases are in South Korea are the result of the Korean War (also related to containment). US bases are in the middle east as the result of wars there. Bases were (and are) built in response to direct threats.

How would they begin to execute policies to support their own interests?\n\nYou can't seriously expect me to outline all of their interests. The basic premise though, is that there is a limited amount of resources on Earth, and countries naturally want more of it. That is why China is trying to win over influence in oil rich countries in the Middle East.

Why doesn't Iraq have the freedom to protect its own interest? Regardless, why doesn't the UN stop the invasion? Why does the US almost always unilaterally makes these decisions? Why is the US the one that's allowed to break the UN rules and protect its interests? Besides, you're comparing the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait over *oil* to the *genocidal* efforts of the Nazis.

Pretty much the UN, without a clear, strong power to lend its credibility.\n\n&gt;The world is a much more advanced place now, politically, economically, and technologically. I mean, are you supposing WWIII would break out without the US to regulate everyone into place?\n\nAgain, you're missing the point. I'm not saying WWII would break out, I'm saying that the US was not involved in the events that led up to WWI and WWII; but because US interests were involved, the US needed to fight to protect those interests. Overseas bases make it A LOT easier to protect those interests. For a modern example, look at the Gulf War. Saddam decides to invade Kuwait to capture oil fields, and increase his leverage over Saudi Arabia; essentially giving him de facto control over a huge portion of the world's oil supply. This was against US interests, so they needed to repel the invasion. This would have been much more difficult to do if the Saudis didn't allow US bases on their soil.\n\n&gt;I rejected the notion that any state, let alone the US, needs bases overseas to protect itself. We don't allow foreign bases on US soil and there are lots of nations who do not have remote military bases, willing or not.\n\nYou're comparing apples and oranges here. Foreign countries don't need bases in the US because there is no threat to them from Mexico or Canada. Other countries also don't have to overcome thousands of miles of ocean to deploy forces to other countries. The very nature of America's geography necessitates pre-deployed forces. Russia and China don't have overseas bases, but they have bases on their own territory in remote areas. Its just geography.\n\n&gt;What are you suggesting? That China and Russia would try to rule the world as the a new, villainous super-power over the UN? To what end? What for? How?\n\nNow you're the one with the hyperbole. As i have mentioned several times already, China and Russia do not share the same interests as the US. That is a simple fact. And that is why a diminished US presence at the UN **would not be in America's interest** Do you think the world would be a better place under Chinese or Russian hegemony?

A drastic change in grand strategy would require years, if not decades to implement. Just the simple act of closing down bases would be a logistical nightmare. Second, the question is essentially asking about \"complete isolationism\" so I'm not sure why you're using that point to refute my argument.\n\n&gt;Right now the UN is nothing but a front for the US. This would have to end if the US were to close it's bases overseas. There's no reason to believe that the UN couldn't continue to function and take over security roles should the US relinquish is monopoly.\n\nWhen I say the effects are negative, they are largely concerning US interests. The UN will still continue to function, but states like China and Russia will have more influence. If the US were to close its bases overseas, then many countries would doubt whether the US can credibly deter any aggression. This significantly decreases the America's influence abroad.\n\n&gt;US aid/alliances are what fuels many of these conflicts to begin with. It's easy for one to be arrogant when they have the biggest bully backing them up. One speaks softer when they're no longer holding all the cards.\n\nThis is a valid point, but the examples I listed show that there is also evidence that US aid prevents conflicts.\n\n&gt;This is a complete fabrication. Our incessant involvement overseas is what created the tension and the false need to protect ourselves to begin with.\n\nWWI and WWII are pretty clear examples of why isolationism isn't in America's interest. We tried to limit our involvement abroad, but in the end our interests were at risk so we fought the war. WWII is the perfect example of why bases were (and still are) necessary. The US would have been nearly useless in fighting the Nazis if it didn't have the UK to use as a staging ground. In the pacific, remember that the US spent almost the entire war just *getting to* mainland Japan. \n\nAlso, I'm not sure where you got the notion that the need of a state to protect itself is \"false\". The primary function of a state is to ensure its survival, and the survival of its citizens. The US could sit back and wait for shit to come to the US, or we could preempt that by promoting our interests abroad (Again, see WWII and post-WWII strategy).\n\n&gt;Again, there's no reason to believe other UN members couldn't step up.

In this case foreign bases and foreign aid are aiding in stability. The more stable the world is, the more opportunities US companies will have to prosper. My area of knowledge is focused in Asia so I will only talk about that here. \n\nHistorically in Eastern Asia, China has been the dominating power because there is no other power strong enough to balance them. Currently there are multiple irridentist issues, mainly the demarcation of the South China Sea, the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands and of course, Korea. \n\nWhy does this matter to the US?\nThe region has a combined GDP of more than $16 trillion USD. This is a lot of money and potential for US companies. As well as that the shipping lanes through the Malacca straight and the South China Sea are some of the busiest in the world and keeping them open is important for pretty much everyone. \n\nBut why does the US have to be involved, why can't they sort it out themselves? A unique characteristic in NEASIA is their lack of regional frameworks for cooperation (Like the EU or AU or MERCOSUR). This means that there is no easy way to resolve conflicts and instead you get skirmishes and arms races like we have seen in 2011 with the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands and for the past decade around the South China Sea. US involvement in the region, by allying and supporting all of China's adversaries, is preventing open conflict because to start a war would be too costly.\n\nSo what happens if the US pulls out: \n\nWorse case scenario assuming all the conflicts come to a head after the US stops balancing China. \nKeeping Japan under US protection is stopping them from going nuclear themselves; they have the means to produce bombs with in months, but right now they don't need to because of US protection. In addition, they are limiting the size of their armed forces because of US presence(which they pay billions every year for). Any move to increase the size of the Japanese military would cause an arms race between Japan, China and South Korea which could also spread to the ASEAN nations if they are unable to resolve their maritime borders and wish to press their claims.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1im3iy", "selftext": "That is under the assumption that the single industry still exists. I agree that many cities, states, and even nations can survive on single industries, Hell Michigan in the early 1900's attests to that fact. However, GM is an 18th of what it once was in Michigan, and that is a generous figure. Plants (the ones that are still open) that used to run on 3,000 workers a day are now operating with 50 people. Bottom line is Michigan has to find a new industry but that is going to be hard to do with ghost towns, a broken infrastructure, ever growing crime, a collapsing school system, and an eviscerated tax base. They need a miracle. \n\nAnd like I said I'm not blaming either party. The Dems were in office when the economy collapsed and the Reps are in office now that they are trying to rebuild. As much as I hate Snyder he was given a turd to polish into gold. I don't care the banner of anyone's politics, there is no coming back from economic collapse on that scale, not quickly anyway. \n\nEdit: and for the \"not borrowing constantly bit\" Detroit and Michigan literally had no other option. You can't take a city with 2 million people, dwindle it down to 700,000, and think that those people are going to be able to support the city with 2/3rds of it's tax base missing. Even more if you consider the fact that the only people really left in Detroit are the poor. The tax base is more than likely to be closer to a 10th of what it once was. If Detroit didn't borrow to try and revive the city everyone would have had to just let the city fall into 3rd world conditions. Everyone would have had to have left. There wouldn't have been anyway to fund the police stations, fire stations, schools, trash pick-up, sewage, electricity, water infrastructure, public transportation,etc. etc. The only thing they can do now is destroy half the city, let nature retake it, and start over with what they have left. That is going to take an investment, and right now the state of Michigan isn't able afford the loans or the grants to do so.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "It is true that Detroit is a Democratic city, but to dwindle Detroit's problems down to it's city politics is totally ignore what destroyed Michigan. Many cities went under like Detroit, they just weren't as big as Detroit so they don't get as much attention like Flint, Saginaw, and to a lesser extent Grand Rapids and Lansing. Grand Rapids is a very conservative city for example. Except for what johnpseudo pointed out with the city's \"restore Detroit\" initiatives the state's problems weren't even largely due to politics. \n\nThe state's problem (or mistake if you will) was that it didn't have a diversified economy. You can think of it like stocks. You wouldn't put all of your wealth into one stock, you diversify your stocks and bonds. Well, Michigan didn't do that and when the one singular thing that built their economy left the entire state crashed. Yes Detroit crashed too but take a moment to google destitute and dying cities in Michigan, Detroit is by no means an exception. \n\nThe only time politics comes into it is when (like what johnpseudo said) the cities attempted to make revival initiatives for the city. Again, Detroit wasn't the only city that did this. Flint lead this charge way before any other Michigan city did that. Now that Grand Rapids is failing it is too. It didn't have an auto plant but a furniture industry and when the jobs and the money left Michigan the furniture business failed. Grand Rapids is falling on hard times now and they are attempting initiatives themselves, especially because their murder rate has risen so sharply in a short amount of time. \n\nTrying to point to Detroit and say \"Hey, they had a Democratic city council, that is why they went bankrupt\" is to totally ignore what happened to Michigan. I'll be the first to admit that Detroit's politics were horribly corrupt, but it wasn't because they were liberal, it was because they were in a dying city that is known as \"murder city\" to the rest of the country. The fact stands that Michigan is a red state and has been for some time. I'm not blaming the GOP either, I'm simply pointing out that political ideals have little to do with what happened. GM would have left regardless of who was in office.

I agree that many cities, states, and even nations can survive on single industries, Hell Michigan in the early 1900's attests to that fact. However, GM is an 18th of what it once was in Michigan, and that is a generous figure. Plants (the ones that are still open) that used to run on 3,000 workers a day are now operating with 50 people. Bottom line is Michigan has to find a new industry but that is going to be hard to do with ghost towns, a broken infrastructure, ever growing crime, a collapsing school system, and an eviscerated tax base. They need a miracle. \n\nAnd like I said I'm not blaming either party. The Dems were in office when the economy collapsed and the Reps are in office now that they are trying to rebuild. As much as I hate Snyder he was given a turd to polish into gold. I don't care the banner of anyone's politics, there is no coming back from economic collapse on that scale, not quickly anyway. \n\nEdit: and for the \"not borrowing constantly bit\" Detroit and Michigan literally had no other option. You can't take a city with 2 million people, dwindle it down to 700,000, and think that those people are going to be able to support the city with 2/3rds of it's tax base missing. Even more if you consider the fact that the only people really left in Detroit are the poor. The tax base is more than likely to be closer to a 10th of what it once was. If Detroit didn't borrow to try and revive the city everyone would have had to just let the city fall into 3rd world conditions. Everyone would have had to have left. There wouldn't have been anyway to fund the police stations, fire stations, schools, trash pick-up, sewage, electricity, water infrastructure, public transportation,etc. etc. The only thing they can do now is destroy half the city, let nature retake it, and start over with what they have left. That is going to take an investment, and right now the state of Michigan isn't able afford the loans or the grants to do so.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I'll take this one. I lived in Michigan during the late 90's and early 2000's because my mom is from there. The biggest problem Michigan had is that it put all of it's eggs into one basket, the GM basket. Starting in the 1970's GM started to close plants and began moving jobs to Mexico. The biggest car producing cities were Detroit and Flint (you don't mention Flint but it is a big part of Michigan's story). \n\nWhen GM first started to pull out they said \"Don't worry, nothing to see here, everything will be just fine\" and for the most part people believed them. So, instead of the entirety of the state looking for a new economy they kept plugging along at the one that was slowly trickling out of the state. \n\nBy 2003 most of the major plants were shutting down left and right. I lived in Lansing at the time and there was a huge plant that employed a large chunk of the people in that city. When they shut down that was it, and that is the same story for every city that had a plant. Detroit was a major city that grew rapidly under the invention of the combustible engine and the mass production of it. The rapid increase in demand of cars fueled Detroit's growth. When the need slowed down because of the stabilization of the market the city's growth stabilized. Then GM began to take it's jobs to Mexico, that is when the bottom fell out from under Detroit. I mentioned Flint because that city was actually hit the hardest. What was once a booming beautiful city was reduced to million dollar grants to tear down part of the city that had become a ghost town. \n\nOnce the jobs went the middle class bottomed out and everything began to domino. When the middle class couldn't continue to fuel the states economy with consumerism everything went; Grand Rapids furniture business went to shit, stores began to lay off workers because of decreases in revenue, Michigan's unemployment exploded flooding cheap and/or desperate labor markets, and even restaurants began to take huge hits. I worked at a Red Lobster in Grand Rapids and I would make easily $100/ day on the weekend if not $150. We began to have $13 days and even worse, we started getting called off from our shifts all together. No one had any money. My friend was fired 3 times in one year because labor was so flooded that if you looked at your boss wrong they'd can your ass. She got fired once for not coming in because she was sick. \n\nI remember in 2004 I was going to work and the highway was closed down because the president of Mexico and his armored enclave were making their way down the road to meet with GM executives. Not only were we losing our lively hoods but we weren't even allowed to use the roads when his highness was using them............ sorry bout that, notice a touch of resentment? Moving on...\n\nSo that is pretty much what happened. The social safety nets were flooded, if you called the social security office to inquire about food stamps you got a recording that said \"we are not taking applications at this time\", and all the food banks were totally tapped and running dry. People try to blame it on politics or unions, but the reality of the matter is that Michigan had an economy based around one company. When that company decided that lower wages were more important than loyalty Michigan went under. Without GM leaving Michigan would not be what it is like today. Then usher in Gov. Snyder and his \"emergency managers\" and voila! You have a once great state reduced to rubble. \n\nMy parents still live there and want to move back to Texas to live by me and my family. They bought their house for $125,000 in a suburb of Grand Rapids. When the economy tanked in 2009 the value of their home went down to $70,000. They are now back up to $90,000 and willing to take a loss to get out of there. \n\nEdit: and as a heads up for anyone that wants to tell you their problem was Democrats, remember, they've been a red state for at least 8 years now. They just passed the \"right to work\" act effectively killing their unions. Michigan has been about as red as Virginia for some time now. \n\nEdit: and one more thing. When the jobs began to go so did the citizens. Many people started to leave Detroit and the state all together in a mass Exodus. Michigan lost so many citizens it actually lost seats in the House of Representatives. Detroit once had about 2 million people living in it, now it is just 706,585. There literally aren't enough people left in the city to support the infrastructure. They lost 25% of their population in just a decade. Detroit physically embodies the consequences of American corporations moving their jobs, and our manufacturing economy out of the country.

People outside of Michigan don't seem to truly grasp the importance of GM for Michigan. I see a lot of people who say things like politics is what destroyed Michigan, politics has little to do with it. It was the state not having a diverse economy. \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aUUuTBVypk\n\nI also changed the original link to one with better pictures. I'm actually really glad this post is here. I feel like people don't really understand what happened to Michigan and it's struggles go ignored. Michigan is the face of what can happen when Manufacturing economies leave for cheap labor. You might have noticed that the first two links were British, there is also a really good al jazeera video about it. This last American link is the only American intensive report I've seen regarding Detroit and Michigan. I feel like our media and news outlets will touch on what is happening in a broad manner but largely ignores Detroit. It breaks my fucking heart to see what is happening to the state of Michigan. \n\nThese videos also aren't reporting how bad the violence has gotten, how cities have cut the police force, and how crime has sky rocketed. Grand Rapids is now beginning to become a murder mecca. Detroit has gotten so violent that a lot of people won't go into the city anymore. Back in 2003 I'd drive into Detroit at 3am no problem to hang with my friends, no one would do that today. \n\nDetroit and Michigan are the face of what our corporations have done to this country. Everyone wants to look around and point fingers as to why we have stagnant wages and why the middle class is bottoming out. Then everyone gets in their cars made in Mexico and goes to Walmart to buy products made in China. They are obsessed with things like iphones and ipads which are made by people in third world countries who are payed next to nothing. This is why the American middle class is struggling, because these jobs that used to support the middle class are non-existent now. It is just more obvious in Michigan. \n\nAlso, a lot of people like to blame the unions which I find cruel. The Unions certainly afforded people a livable wage and retirement but the people who worked at GM weren't paid gold and diamonds. Many people made between $20-30/hour with benefits. When GM began to move it's jobs at an accelerated rate in the early 2000's they also began to cut people's pensions. My friend's dad lost his pension entirely and had to go back to work in an economy that was decimated. Even those who retired from GM have lost their livelihoods because of pension cuts or eliminations. The last linked video explains GMs monumental cost to it's retires and it's employees. That was the bottom line for their moving out of the country. There is a part in the last link where one of the GM engineers sort of smirking calls the retires of GM \"entitled\" because they expect the pensions that they worked 30 and 40 years to get, that just made me scream. This is the mentality of these companies. They dissolve contracts with the people who built their companies and then just sort of smirk and say \"sorry, you shouldn't have been so entitled\". It makes me so unbelievably upset. \n\nHere is a recent article regarding GM investing $691 million in Mexico to expand their plants. It is just more of the same. It is all about greed. \n\nhttp://www.detroitnews.com/article/20130626/AUTO0103/306260107/1148/rss25\n", "id": "t1_cb5vbhe", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "maowsers93", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cb6b5ef", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "egghead94", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1im3iy", "selftext": "Yeah, no problem.

Yes Detroit crashed too but take a moment to google destitute and dying cities in Michigan, Detroit is by no means an exception. \n\nThe only time politics comes into it is when (like what johnpseudo said) the cities attempted to make revival initiatives for the city. Again, Detroit wasn't the only city that did this. Flint lead this charge way before any other Michigan city did that. Now that Grand Rapids is failing it is too. It didn't have an auto plant but a furniture industry and when the jobs and the money left Michigan the furniture business failed. Grand Rapids is falling on hard times now and they are attempting initiatives themselves, especially because their murder rate has risen so sharply in a short amount of time. \n\nTrying to point to Detroit and say \"Hey, they had a Democratic city council, that is why they went bankrupt\" is to totally ignore what happened to Michigan. I'll be the first to admit that Detroit's politics were horribly corrupt, but it wasn't because they were liberal, it was because they were in a dying city that is known as \"murder city\" to the rest of the country. The fact stands that Michigan is a red state and has been for some time. I'm not blaming the GOP either, I'm simply pointing out that political ideals have little to do with what happened. GM would have left regardless of who was in office.

I agree that many cities, states, and even nations can survive on single industries, Hell Michigan in the early 1900's attests to that fact. However, GM is an 18th of what it once was in Michigan, and that is a generous figure. Plants (the ones that are still open) that used to run on 3,000 workers a day are now operating with 50 people. Bottom line is Michigan has to find a new industry but that is going to be hard to do with ghost towns, a broken infrastructure, ever growing crime, a collapsing school system, and an eviscerated tax base. They need a miracle. \n\nAnd like I said I'm not blaming either party. The Dems were in office when the economy collapsed and the Reps are in office now that they are trying to rebuild. As much as I hate Snyder he was given a turd to polish into gold. I don't care the banner of anyone's politics, there is no coming back from economic collapse on that scale, not quickly anyway. \n\nEdit: and for the \"not borrowing constantly bit\" Detroit and Michigan literally had no other option. You can't take a city with 2 million people, dwindle it down to 700,000, and think that those people are going to be able to support the city with 2/3rds of it's tax base missing. Even more if you consider the fact that the only people really left in Detroit are the poor. The tax base is more than likely to be closer to a 10th of what it once was. If Detroit didn't borrow to try and revive the city everyone would have had to just let the city fall into 3rd world conditions. Everyone would have had to have left. There wouldn't have been anyway to fund the police stations, fire stations, schools, trash pick-up, sewage, electricity, water infrastructure, public transportation,etc. etc. The only thing they can do now is destroy half the city, let nature retake it, and start over with what they have left. That is going to take an investment, and right now the state of Michigan isn't able afford the loans or the grants to do so.

For example, during the Civil War President Lincoln suspended Habeas Corpus and jailed many people including Journalists who spoke against him or in favor of the Confederates. Beyond that Sherman's march to the sea burned everything in his soldier's paths without respect to private property or people's lives. He essentially leveled cities in Georgia in order to destroy the Confederate ability to fight. If you want to see the worst examples of a police state you need to look no farther than a Civil War history book. Even after the war when Lincoln was assassinated the abuses continued. For example a suspect in his murder was never found, so his mother was arrested and hanged for his crimes. Many things that happened during this period are so far beyond anything we could imagine today.\n\nBeyond the Civil war there are many other instances of Government abuses like Civil rights injustices toward minorities, the detention of Japanese Americans in camps during WW2, horrible human right's abuses at the hands of corporations during the 2nd industrial revolution that were all but ignored by the government, etc. etc.\n\nIt is my opinion that what we are going through now is no worse than anything else we've experienced before. It is in fact insulting to the people who lived through the Civil War, Jim Crow era, or the Red Scare in my opinion to state we are worse now than ever before. In many instances what we are going through now is a cake walk especially when considering parents were hanged for their children's crimes in the past. It is often apparent to me that many people who say we are worse now than ever before are not up to par on their history. I have in fact gone toe-to-toe with many people on this topic who are largely ignorant to government history prior to the 1990's. \n\nThat said I am in no way trying to down play our issues today. We do as a country face injustice and hardship. The level of greed and incompetence that runs through our separate powers must be addressed or we will continue to backslide into nonsense. Will it result in armed rebellion?? I certainly hope not considering the result we had from the last one. I think many people are quick to scream for a revolution with no real understanding of what a revolution requires or results in. \n\nSo, are we worse now than ever before? No, not even close. It will do you good to keep in mind that our media has a job and that job is to create profit. Because their bottom line is based in monetary value and not social engagement most of what they say is sensationalism.

Our foreign policy is a different story. \n\nEdit again: Also, this is the first time internet and mass technology has come into play. It was inevitable that our Governments (federal, city, and state) were going to attempt to exploit our new technical world. It is up to us to push back and that is what we are seeing right now.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1fg9tu", "selftext": "Liberalism has an emphasis with the role of government acting as a middle man preventing abuses from employers towards workers. This also goes for everything else i.e civil rights abuses, sexual inequality, agism, etc. etc. Liberals see the government as playing a defining role in defending people's rights when they are attacked by employers, states, cities, schools, corporate interests, other citizens, etc. A good example of this is when the national guard had to be called in so kids could integrate schools in Arkansas. That would be a form of governmental intervention in which liberals view government playing a vital role. \n\nSo, all that said Democrats are the moderate versions of liberals. Both parties view economic policies with a foundation of free market capitalism that is monitored through regulations to prevent abuses towards workers, communities, and the economic system itself. The banking industries irresponsible actions that lead to the global economic crisis recently is an example of such an abuse that could have been prevented through regulation in the eyes of liberals and democrats. \n\nIn real world experiences these policies would include favoring minimum wage with liberals favoring a higher wage than Dems, laws against monopolies, heavy banking regulations, rules enforcing overtime standards, laws against worker abuses (harassment, racism, ageism, sexism, etc.), strict safety standards in the work place, regulations regarding the environment and industry, etc. etc. etc. \n\nThese are the main bullet points of Democratic and Liberal economic policies. Many people in conservative circles believe all these regulations hurt industry and should be governed by the free market, i.e if people don't like the practice of a business they won't buy from it. This is the main difference between the two schools of thought regarding economic policies. \n\nEdit: Also, when dealing with taxes Liberals and Dems tend to find a healthy tax rate (something similar to what we had in the 90's for example) is needed to fully fund our infrastructure. So Dems and Liberals would be more than willing to pay a 30%+ tax rate with something similar for things like capital gains in order to fund schools, roads, parks, higher ed, health care, SS, medicaid, medicare, science, etc. etc. Libs and Dems tend to think that the public sector should invest in the public so as to fund the infrastructure equally rather than rely on the public sector to build or reinforce infrastructure in patches with wealthier area's receiving better care. Again, Dems are the moderate version of liberals so they will always favor the lesser version of what Liberal ideals are. Dems and Libs are in favor of a progressive taxation system and almost never embrace a regressive taxation policy.

Congress is who passes/filibusters/blocks/etc. domestic budgets/regulations/etc. In the USA congress has control over domestic day to day practices. The only real power the Executive Branch has is foreign affairs and the power of veto over domestic policies congress passes. The president's power of veto is an important power. Take the current administration for example, the House is Republican controlled and the Executive branch is Democratic controlled. Because of this even if the House passes something (and it gets passed the Senate) they like regarding the tax system, budget, regulations, de-regulations, etc. the president can veto it. So, even though the president can't pass budgets he can block them if they aren't to his liking. This is why we are in the situation we are in with a non functioning federal government. The polarization between the parties in both chambers and the executive branch have brought legislative business to a halt. \n\nSo, that said the president can influence the economy in other ways as we saw with the Bush administration. For example the president can go to war. Wars are expensive and they take decades to pay off. We were paying of WW2 until the 90's. So, going to war (or multiple wars like Bush) will defiantly influence the economy because of the cost. This is what I mean by \"round-about\" because the president isn't directly involved with the passage of budgets but because of their power regarding foreign policy the executive branch's activities can put us into debt. \n\nAll that said I think many Americans don't realize how our system is set up and who gets what power.
