{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;Yes. The US system is extremely representative, especially when compared to many other liberal democracies.\n\nAre you sure about that? In what way is it more representative?\n\nIn terms of like-to-like representation the US system is pretty terrible, whilst the 113th Congress looks to be more diverse, none previously have been. Blacks get the best representation, and that's down to gerrymandering rather than true representation, and even then it's only in the House where they have about 10.1% of the House seats, and are 12.6% of the population, and a single one in the Senate.\n\nOther minorities do much worse, Hispanics make up 16.4% of the population, but have only 30 in the House, a proportion of only 6.8%, and in the Senate, just 3.\n\nIt's not just minorities, there are only 98 women in the whole of Congress, 78 in the House and just 20 in the Senate. \n\nNow compare this to other Western liberal democracies, namely European countries, Sweden is one of the best in this category, a gender split of 55% / 45%. The [International Human Development Indicator](http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/indicators/83506.html) places the US at 100th place (the default setting is on overall HDI) below countries like Venezuela, Indonesia and even the UAE. And definitely below other liberal democracies.\n\nOn racial representation, it's more difficult in Europe, simply because you have a lot more homogeneous countries with usually over 85% of a single majority.\n\nAnother way I can see representation is through views being represented, and first-past-the-post fails in that. PR gives the voter much more choice, in the German system, you have 6 parties. Those 6 parties aren't the total in Parliament, they are the total in government. Surely that's much more representative than possibly having 49% of your district / state / country ignored? Even in the only FPTP left in Europe, that being the UK, we have multiple parties. With 2 major, Conservative and Labour, one semi major being Lib Dems, and then a smattering of smaller parties the UK looks to be still more representative.\n\nFinally, you have actual representation, how many people do you need to represent. The US is by far the worst in this category, though I could suppose that's due to it's size. However 535 federal representatives is still a fairly small government, the UK has only 66 million people, and has 625 MP's, plus 750 or so Lords (Who might be unelected, but are still representatives).\n\n**TL;DR The US federal system is one of the least representative liberal democracies, and is actually less representative than many non-liberal democracies in some respects.**", "id": "t1_cb53673", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "naryn", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "It's more representative because it put constituents in power rather than party elites. Ethnic and gender representation is a bit of a red herring because America is a civic nation rather than an ethnic one, so you don't need a Latino in office to represent Latino interests, a black representative is just as capable of representing Latino interests. The fact that it's disproportionately white men in office has more to do with historical trends of institutionalized racism and sexism that persist in offices that prefer a lot of experience (women and minorities haven't had equal opportunities for long enough to have a proportional amount of old people with enough political experience to be elected to federal office). These old white men are just as vulnerable to being coerced by minority votes as old black, Hispanic, or Asian men or women. \n\nAs for the proportion of Representatives to population, there's no evidence that the size of a political body has any bearing on how representatives vote. The only thing more representatives causes is higher overhead costs in running the government. \n\nI already covered why plurality voting and the resulting two party system puts more policy making power in the hands of constituents. In Germany, those six parties have hard party lines that are controlled by party elites and won't change to fit the will of the constituents. Then they form post-election coalitions that end up only serving the interests of the plurality party (which is given complete control as long as the coalition survives), so 60-70% of the population is unrepresented by those controlling policy. Two party systems, on the other hand only alienate people who vote for their seat's non-incumbent every time (about 35%), everyone else has a chance to use the threat of their vote to enforce their will on their representative, even if (especially if) they voted against him. In practice this gives you complete ideological freedom instead of having to choose between 4-10 strict and unbending platforms that only care about forwarding their ideology rather than building trusting relationships with constituents in order to buy their votes.\n\nAs you point out, there's a lot of ways to define how \"representative\" a government is.

If your state doesn't have open primaries, then register with a party (just like registering to vote), it's not like it's binding for the general election if nobody you like gets nominated. \n\nMoney is power only by proxy in politics. Money buys advertising which raises awareness of a candidate and therefore possible votes. The average voter still holds the power in the end and can choose not to be swayed by the advertisements paid for by rich donors. Put simply, the power of donors is only in their ability to get votes.

If your state doesn't have open primaries, then register with a party (just like registering to vote), it's not like it's binding for the general election if nobody you like gets nominated. \n\nSo register for a party even if you wouldn't vote for their candidates, so that you can vote in their primaries? What if you're a 20 year member of the opposition party? Not everybody should have to call themselves a R or D in order to fully exercise their franchise and open primaries can give the people that freedom.\n\n&gt;Money is power only by proxy in politics.\n\nNo money is viability in politics: without the money you're sunk and nobody will support you because they know you're going to lose. Even if they know you can garner popular support (hence money is MORE valuable than votes because you won't make it to the general without money.)\n\n&gt;Donor A is only influential because people follow his ideas and therefore candidate B.\n\nNo 'Donor A' is pretty clearly influential because of their money. They can get their policy priorities into the plank (e.g. Senator Blunt's amendment to limit the legal liability of some agriculture/biotech firms.) That meets your criteria of power-as-policy-determination.\n\n&gt;Not that it matters, trying to elect a single leader using any and every possible definition of \"fair\" soon ends up being a convoluted mess\n\nThis is what I was talking about when I said that we shouldn't surrender to Duverger's Law. Because elections cannot be universally fair there's no sense in having them be fair at all? This is quite cynical. Not that it matters, you already acknowledge that they get pandered to 'a lot more.' By your definition *that is political power* so you've already acknowledged that the voter doesn't have equal power. At least not equal power to effect policy.\n\n&gt;There's no (legal) magic potion that turns money into policy.\n\n[When congress edits two words from a Citigroup memo and submit it to law, this notion becomes comical.](http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/05/23/banks-lobbyists-help-in-drafting-financial-bills/?ref=citigroupinc)\n\nEdit: added link", "id": "t1_cb59s6j", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "OPA_GRANDMA_STYLE", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cb55700", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1430422715, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1374163327, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cb59s6j", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1374162294", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cb54bb4", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1430424949, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cb55700", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1374144827", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cb53rhk", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430425364, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cb54bb4", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1374138146", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cb53673", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1430425624, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cb53rhk", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1374134578", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cb4ynli", "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1430425902, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ij0ht", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cb53673", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1374131409", "ups": 4, "distinguished": null}

The Conservatives allowed their candidate for Totnes to be selected by an open primary when they were trying to push a modernisation theme. The reason it's not done a great deal is because of the power of local party associations. They're full of a lot of useless old people, who don't do a whole lot either in politics or locally but are the worst kind of self important people known to man, who thoroughly love their power and especially in the Tory Party, they like to kick off every now and then.\n\nRemoving their ability to select candidates to a greater degree than the current strong arming they get from Westminster would thoroughly annoy them; and if you know what these tea partying, cricket loving, middle class, Little Englanders are like then you know that'd be trouble. Of course the official line is that primaries cost too much to run but this is just a cop out. There's no excuse for not having primaries in the internet age, candidates should be vetted to avoid things turning into a popularity contest but a shortlist of five or so should be open to local party members to vote upon.\n\nIt's not particularly needed for candidates to live in the area they're standing for either. Which leads to lots of party favourites being parachuted into areas they have no idea about. Witness David Miliband, born and raised in London, representing an area near Sunderland.
