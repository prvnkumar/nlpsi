At least this way people who can't pay get the problem solved cheap if it gets too bad. \n\nThis is incorrect. With the current system I can't afford insurance so I don't get it. \n\nIf I don't get sick, great I am healthy and paid nothing.\n\nBut if get sick, I have to go to Emergency Room. I get treated and find out I have some chronic disease because I waited to long to be treated since I couldn't afford to go to the doctor. Now I owe the Emergency room a large amount of money.\n\nSince I don't have insurance I have to pay out of pocket for my medications and the treatments I need. Being that I can't even afford insurance I can't pay these bills and I go bankrupt trying to pay them off as my bills reach the 10s of thousands.\n\nUnder the ACA if I can't afford insurance I can get medicaid. If I am in one of the red states that didn't expand medicaid then I can't afford insurance so i have to pay mandate.  Currently that mandate is only $95 bucks for an adult but lets say its 2016 and I owe the $695 dollars. \n\nIf I don't get sick that means I paid $695 dollars for nothing.\n\nIf I do get sick though instead of having to go to the Emergency room I can sign up for insurance and they can't refuse me for pre-existing condition. Now I can go to the doctor and the insurance pays for the visit and for my medication and treatments.\n\nTo sum up I can either pay nothing and hope not to get sick but if I do end up owing 10,000 of dollars that  I can't afford or with the ACA I can not get sick and pay 58 bucks a month but if I do get sick I can still get insurance which will cover all my medical expenses.\n\n\n&gt;So instead they send you a bill that somewhat resembles what people with insurance pay and charge the government for the rest. \n\nSo you think it is better for everyone else to pay taxes because this person doesn't have insurance then for this person to pay an individual tax for not having insurance.", "id": "t1_ccs6acb", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Filbert_Turtle", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ohmii", "id": "t1_ccs73nt", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "faceless_masses", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;For some reason I doubt you are actually talking about you.\n\nYour right it is not, it is an example.\n\n&gt;his supposed person you reference who can't afford insurance will be just fine.

However, the point of my quick analysis is that the worst represented states are heavily Republican.  If you make representation fairer across the board, these underrepresented states will gain a higher percentage of the new seats, because they're in the \"unfairest\" positions currently.

As the more populous states would have their representatives increase at a higher ratio then those with lower ratios since House representatives are distributed by population.\n\nThis was a state by state multiplication.  Other than the 8 representative mixup, you're incorrect.  Assuming each state maintained it's current R:D ratio, adjusting for 300,000, the change ends up being more-or-less a wash.

[The ACA has caused only about a 1 percent to 3 percent increase in premiums, according to several independent experts.](http://www.factcheck.org/2011/10/factchecking-health-insurance-premiums/)\n\nThat is not skyrocketing. \n\nYou also forget to mention that the reason for the increase in premiums is due to new benefits that weren't had before such as:\n\n* Cover preventive care without copays or deductibles.\n* Allow adult children to stay on parents\u2019 policies until age 26.\n* Increase annual coverage limits.\n* Cover children without regard for preexisting conditions.\nIn fact benefits like no copays or deductibles and increased coverage limits will save each person on the annual costs they spend out of pocket to the doctor.\n\n&gt;its implementation has been horrible\n\nPoor implementation does not equate to the law being horrible. You can implement a horrible law quite well or implement a Good law poorly.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe the implementation of the ACA might of gone over much smoother if Republicans and Tea Partiers weren't purposely setting up any road blocks they could to purposely make it fail.\n\n&gt;**it is quite possible** to have caused loss in hours worked and loss of jobs\n\nSo a law is not good because of something that isn't proven?\n\nIt is also quite possible that there were no loss of hours or jobs due to the ACA.\n\n&gt;many large companies have been exempted, the entire employer mandate has been delayed for a year\n\nThis is more of proof of our failed government officials not that the ACA is a poor law. There should have been no reason to delay this mandate other than to give Big Businesses a tax break for one more year and is an obvious move to appease lobbyists and donators.\n\n&gt;and individuals are going to be fined for not getting insurance when employers aren't required to offer it and the exchanges aren't working.\n\n\nThough it is unfair that they delayed the Employer mandate again this isn't a failure of the ACA, if it was fully implemented this wouldn't be a problem. Instead it is a problem of our government allowing Big Businesses to once again get away with 'murder'.\n\n[As for the healthcare exchange.

The establishment Republicans that want big government, more power, high spending, and just a different set of corporate cronies helped are set at odds with the Republicans that actually believe in smaller government, fiscal responsibility, and more personal freedom. As the chorus of establishment Republicans call for a compromise that keeps the entire ACA and has superficial concessions, the Republican base gets to see who they are and what they really stand for. IMO, it's big-government cronyism and imposing their own social/moral code on others.\n\nThis is what campaigning and elections are for.

Due to this the 15th amendment appears to repeal section 2 of the 14th amendment therefore making felony disfranchisement unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n\nedit - spelling and clarification!", "id": "t1_cc7llgz", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Filbert_Turtle", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1mbebs", "selftext": "&gt; The 15th amendment states nothing about requiring due process, in fact it doesn't state anything about due process at all; it states 'The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.' end of story.\n\nExcept the text is *not* the end of story.

The threshold question is whether or not the deprivation of voting power abridges an interest in life, liberty, or property. Quite clearly it does - there is universal consensus in the caselaw that voting is one of the liberty interests contemplated by the 14th Amendment. So the question then shifts to the due process analysis, which is a two-part question: has there been \"process,\" meaning adequate process within the limits of the Constitution and post-14th Amendment constitutional jurisprudence, and has that process been \"due,\" which very roughly here would mean process sufficient to justify the deprivation in question.\n\nThe complement to this analysis is section 2 of the 14th Amendment, which punishes states that deprive persons of the interests contemplated by section 1 of the 14th Amendment - crucially, \"except for participation in rebellion, or other crime.\" The caselaw universally supports the proposition that disenfranchisement cannot be for just *any* crime - a state likely could not disenfranchise people who fail to timely pay parking tickets, for example - but nevertheless states are afforded wide latitude in depriving criminals of the right to vote. \n\nBroadly stated, felonies are the most severe crimes (there are untested jurisprudential theories holding that Article 2 Section 4's \"high crimes\" are actually worse than ordinary felonies and are limited to capital offenses, but that's off-topic). The 14th Amendment permits disenfranchisement for *at least some* \"crimes.\" The caselaw affirms the proposition that lesser crimes are not candidates for judicial disenfranchisement. But since states are allowed to disenfranchise at least *some* criminals, it necessary follows that *at least felons* are legitimate Constitutional targets of disenfranchisement.\n\nThe case most on point here is [*Richardson v. Ramirez*](http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=418&amp;invol=24) (418 US 24 for those keeping score on Westlaw). Here, the court used language familiar to those of us who tirelessly slaved away in our Constitutional Law classes in law school: the state of California argued, based on long precedent, that \"a compelling state interest must be found to justify exclusion of a class from the franchise,\" and the Supreme Court agreed, upholding a California statute that disenfranchised felons *even after their judicial sentence was up.* In short, they saw the disenfranchisement as part and parcel of the punishment, that much as one can get five years of prison and then ten years of probation, one can get five years of prison and indefinite disenfranchisement without violating basic principles of due process.\n\nBrennan and Marshall wrote a beautiful dissent in that case that I think makes a compelling case that, even if judicial disenfranchisement is permissible (Brennan and Marshall clearly think that it is), that it must be limited only to the prison and probationary periods, or else a second trial must be held to enforce lifetime disenfranchisement much the way a second trial must be held to upgrade certain felony penalties to capital punishments.\n\nYour analysis is interesting but I think off-point. The 13th Amendment bit is largely irrelevant because it calls attention to a statute that was specifically designed to deprive citizens of a \"right\" (to contract for slavery or own slaves), not to create a new right in citizens (to have perpetual access to the franchise). The 15th Amendment analysis is precisely why *Ramirez* is so on point: it construes judicial disenfranchisement as *part of the punishment for the crime,* not *punishment for being punished.* You don't get probation *because you were in prison,* you get probation *because you committed a crime*. Likewise, disenfranchisement statutes don't punish you because you were *punished* for a felony, but they punish you because you *committed* a felony.\n\nMy two cents.

It says: 'Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.'\n\nMeaning: Unless you've been sentenced to involuntary servitude for having committed a crime, it's illegal to force someone to remain employed against their will, or to criminally sanction people for not being employed. \n\nFelons aren't employed by prisons. They are *imprisoned* at prisons, and depending on the state/facility, they *may* be engaged in some kind of prison industry, which is perfectly legal under the 13th amendment. \n\n&gt;The 15th amendment states that 'The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous**[ly having been a slave.]**\n\nInvoluntary servitude has nothing to do with imprisonment, it has to do with being forced to work. It is akin to slavery, and it is not at all akin to being imprisoned for having committed a felony. \n\nFelony disenfranchisement doesn't come into play here. Even if 'involuntary servitude' *did* mean 'convicted of a felony' the State isn't basing your disqualification from voting on your previous status of 'having been imprisoned', they're basing it on your current status of 'someone who has been convicted of a felony'. As you point out, disenfranchisement applies to all felonies, regardless of whether they receive prison sentences or not. Convictions that result in probation sentences can still disenfranchise.\n\n&gt; Felony disfranchisement could be seen as degrading to human dignity as it makes you less of a citizen since you no longer have a say in your government and don't have equal standings with your fellow citizens. \n\nFelons are not on equal standing with other citizens. This is an unfortunate consequence of committing crimes. \n\n&gt;**(a)**Felony disfranchisement could be seen as being inflicted wholly arbitrary. Why just felonies? **(b)**Why not a misdemeanor or a gross misdemeanor? Why all felonies when some are clearly worse then others, and **(c)**some are absolutely absurd (ie it is a class E felony in NY to possess a sparkler)\n\n**a** - This statement is self-contradictory. Felony disenfranchisement applies uniformly to all felonies, and not to non-felonies. That's the opposite of arbitrary. \n\n**b** - Misdemeanors (including gross misdemeanors,) are minor crimes punishable by under a year in prison. Felonies are more serious, and that increase in severity increases the severity of the consequences. \n\n**c** - This is your opinion, and non-felons are afforded the opportunity to voice their opinions and affect public policy by voting for their legislators and representatives. Further, it is not a class E felony in NY to possess a sparkler, it's a violation. As in, a ticket.\n\nNYS Penal Law S 270.00:\n(b) (i)  Except as herein otherwise stated, or except where a permit\nis obtained pursuant to section 405.00, any person who shall possess,\nuse, explode or cause to explode any fireworks or dangerous fireworks isguilty of a violation.\n\nIt is, however, a class E felony if *after you've already been convicted of doing this exact same thing once before, you THEN go and SELL fireworks to MINORS.*: \n\n(iii) A person who has previously been convicted of a violation of\nsubparagraph (ii) of this paragraph within the preceding five years and\nwho shall offer or expose for sale, sell or furnish, any dangerous\nfireworks to any person who is under the age of eighteen, shall be\nguilty of a class E felony.\n\nThis is a little different than you represented it, no? Would you agree that refusing to learn your lesson and cease committing crimes you've been previously convicted of, disregarding the safety of not just oneself but others, who are underage, is a bigger deal than just \"owning a sparkler\"? \n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cc800yk", "author_flair_text": "[Homeland Security][Counter-Terrorism]", "created_utc": "1379130166", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "stickied": false, "title": "Why is felony disfranchisement legal and not considered unconstitutional due to the 13th and 15th amendments?", "media": null, "base10id": 97949512, "id": "t3_1mbebs", "score": 28, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "edited": 1379090882, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 3, "saved": false, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1mbebs/why_is_felony_disfranchisement_legal_and_not/", "name": "t3_1mbebs", "created": 1379086225, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1mbebs/why_is_felony_disfranchisement_legal_and_not/", "author_flair_text": null, "author": "Filbert_Turtle", "created_utc": 1379082625, "distinguished": null, "num_comments": 18, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "ups": 31}

Perhaps it wasn't diagnosed, but it's difficult to say this was behavior from a healthy mind. If you want to say that the sound mind of the average person is capable of entering a \"I will kill everyone I can find\" level of rage, then OK, we can say that this act was the work of a nominally \"healthy\" mind.\n\nJohnnyTork's stats have some interesting features:\n\nThe first paper does not include any data from suicide, which is compromises nearly two thirds of all gun deaths.  It's also from Sweden, which is a very different society than the US.  I'm not saying the data is invalid, but Sweden is a phenomenally happier society which deals with mental illness much better than the US.  This study could also be used to say that Sweden has a good handle on it's mental illness problems. \n\nThe second study,  i don't have access to the whole article, but I think  JohnnyTork missed the meat of the paper.  It seems that the major point is that violence is committed overwhelmingly by angry young males of low socioeconomic status.  While it does say that alcohol/drugs have a greater correlation to violence, the interesting point is the interaction between mental illness AND drugs/alcohol.  It's also about violence in general, not gun violence.  Our society's issues with mental illness have changed dramatically since 91'.  This is one of the reasons's it's really a shame that the NRA shuts down gun research.. We don't have any recent numbers to discuss.\n\nThe third link is quite weak.. It discusses the stigma of mental illness, but doesn't directly address the topic we're discussing.  One of the things we CAN take from the article is that regardless of whether mental illness is prevalent in those who commit gun violence, this does not mean that mental illness is a precondition for gun violence.  This, i'm willing to concede.\n\nMy original comment was intended to covey the fact that most of what we hear from the pundits is spin and kneejerk. Very little of it has been built up from solid numbers. This goes for both sides. \n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7wtccs", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1358190755", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c7uuw40", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430958279, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7wr8ln", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1358183927", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

I'd personally like to see it happen, but the House would be a lot less manageable. We'd definitely have to create several new federal cities like DC located at different corners of the nation to help house all these people and significantly reduce their salaries to lessen the effect on the budget. On the one hand, this would devalue the office and allow the common man to run but also pull a lot of strain on a system that's hard to manage as it is. Especially these days, when everyone mostly votes on party lines, it can be hard to scrounge up the votes for a bill when it means not voting with your party. Imagine doing this with a 10000+ member House.\n\nI think it'd be a cool experiment, though. Who knows, it may work out well. But it'd definitely take 3-4 new federal cities and possibly dividing the house by districts, so that each district votes together, and if there are 5 districts, then the final vote is counted 3-2 or 4-1 instead of 218-217 and prevotes occur by each district. This last part would make it easier to manage.\n\nGerrymandering would likely lose its effect for a while, but having many more districts doesn't eliminate the problem. It'll just take time to make redistricting partisan again.\n\nAnd to anyone who says that's not the solution because we have local politics to make our representation more local, that's BS in the era of Rep/Dem politics. When one side says that they want very little government at every level and the other says they want big government at every level, that doesn't work out well, especially when the federal politicians are the ones doing all the advertising/educating.

Can you name many issues that American voters have reached consensus on that Congress is refusing to address? I can't. It seems like Congress has pretty much done a good job representing the electorate by being bitterly divided.\n\nSecond point:  turnout in the 2010 midterm Congressional election was only about 40 percent. I'm using the mid-term election, since I think that more accurately reflects people who are voting for Congress as opposed to those more concerned with the presidency. I don't think you can seriously make the case that the \"system\" is preventing voters from having their voice heard when the overwhelming majority of voters themselves choose not to have their voices heard.\n\nEDIT: Of course, you could argue that those voters aren't voting because they feel their representative isn't responsive to their opinions. That might be true. It might not be true. It may more likely be because we live in a system of gerrymandered districts where the outcome of the general election is essentially per-ordained in most cases.

This course should show how to handle a gun, properly clean and store a gun and teach all the dangers with it. This would do two things, give us well educated and \"well maintained\" gun owners.

Turns into a government licensing scheme pretty quickly. The problem is actually pretty tricky for the federal government. First, BATFE can only regulate FFLs because there is an assumption that they are engaged in interstate commerce (they would need to buy guns from elsewhere). This gives them jurisdiction to regulate their activity and require the background checks through NICS. It's worth noting here that gun shows are 99.9% FFL dealers, and do run NICS checks at the shows.\nHowever, by no means is a private property transaction on a face to face basis by individuals under federal jurisdiction. It's not interstate commerce unless you're standing on opposite sides of a state line. The federal government just has no right to interfere with an individuals transaction in this case.\nTo gain jurisdiction, you have to remove the property rights of the individuals (against the 4th amendment), which means leasing your guns from the federal government. This just isn't going to happen, as they also can't sieze the 300 million existing guns (if they paid a fair value, as defined in 4th, it would cost more than $3 trillion, assuming $1k each on average).\n\n2. Go talk to some people with FFLs. This doesn't happen. Cite a source on this. BATFE stats don't reflect this at all. There is no difference in the regulation and reporting requirements no matter if you're a home FFL or mortar and brick. The only recent straw purchases done by FFLs were those forced by BATFE itself (as exposed by the recorded phone calls where the FFL refused, knowing it was a straw purcahser, and BATFE said they'd revoke the FFL if he refused to complete the transaction) as part of Wide Receiver and Fast and Furious.\n3. Shall not be infringed. In most states, licenses and tests are required for concealed carry permits. This is essentially the same thing as a poll tax, meaning it does nothing. Again federals have no jurisdiction over private transactions within a state (not involving FFL holders), and can't push any requirements. However, all of the consequences of not knowing how to deal with a gun safely are *already* massively illegal (aka negligent homicide, etc). Also, those crimes are state things, not federal (unless you kill a congressman, federal judge, etc), as the federal government if barred from policing the states.\n\nGiven that the shooter murdered someone and stole the weapons for the school shooting, I highly doubt these requirements would do anything but harm law abiding people.
