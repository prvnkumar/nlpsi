Industrialization itself does not mean that people will be working shorter hours for a decent wage. The 8-hour-day, the weekend, safety standards, and benefits were all won from employers through unified labor. And even now, companies like Wal-Mart will intentionally keep workers on part-time work so that they don't need to provide those workers benefits. Companies, of course, seek profit by their nature.\n\nIf we are assuming that Chinese people or Indonesian people WANT to be working 12-hour-days, that is where the view becomes problematic. It may be their best option but that doesn't make the exploitation of their labor justified. They will need to demand those same things from their own employers and frankly the United States could do a lot to help working people in foreign nations. Historically we have done the very opposite. The United States has usually worked to preserve the dominant position of business and prevent a raising of living standards.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "This is a really problematic point of view that I hear from people regularly on reddit. If you look at American history you will see that our own dismal working conditions during the industrial revolution were not seen as some kind of \"godsend.\" People came to America from all over the world as a land of opportunity, it's true, but it didn't change the fact that many ended up working long hours for little pay, only to be tossed to the curb by an employer after they were no longer useful. This became an untenable situation because of those conditions, which gave rise to the American labor movement.\n\nSimilarly let me use a particular recent example from China. There's a film you may be able to find online called \"Red Dust\" about workers in a battery factory in China who were constantly exposed to cadmium dust. Cadmium is a heavy metal, heavier and more toxic than lead. Many of the (mostly) women who worked in this factory ended up with kidney and liver failure and were set to die by the time they were in their mid-late twenties. As a response they protested, they organized, and they lobbied their local government to do everything within their power to ensure that this wouldn't happen to others.\n\nIt is true that these are opportunities. But for unskilled labor, business has every advantage. Unskilled labor is plentiful and exploitable and without regulations, without unions, without some way of the worker making their interests heard and represented, they will be trampled *regardless* of whether the nation is or is not industrialized. A situation of extreme worker exploitation is not a necessary step on the road toward a developed society.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I'm not saying these are fun jobs.

It means that goods are mass produced and can therefore be made available at a cheaper cost to a wider section of the population.\n\nHowever even in America, an industrialized nation, if we were to do away with our labor standards and safeguards, we would see the same kind of abuses here that we see elsewhere in the world. Industrialization itself does not mean that people will be working shorter hours for a decent wage. The 8-hour-day, the weekend, safety standards, and benefits were all won from employers through unified labor. And even now, companies like Wal-Mart will intentionally keep workers on part-time work so that they don't need to provide those workers benefits. Companies, of course, seek profit by their nature.\n\nIf we are assuming that Chinese people or Indonesian people WANT to be working 12-hour-days, that is where the view becomes problematic. It may be their best option but that doesn't make the exploitation of their labor justified. They will need to demand those same things from their own employers and frankly the United States could do a lot to help working people in foreign nations. Historically we have done the very opposite. The United States has usually worked to preserve the dominant position of business and prevent a raising of living standards. Even recently, the Obama administration used its power to block a minimum wage increase in Haiti from 33 cents an hour to 66 cents an hour, despite the fact that this was unanimously approved in their parliament.\n\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/wikileaks-haiti-minimum-wage-the-nation-2011-6\n\nSo equating \"this is their best option\" with \"they really are grateful for and enjoy this work\" is the issue.

This is the type of situation that brought about the American labor movement, because the situation is intolerable to any person.\n\nSo... best option? Maybe.

Apparently people disagreed with that.\n\nBut let's address OP's question, then. Many of these companies, whether it's Apple producing iPhones and iPads in China or Hanes producing t-shirts in Haiti, make a significant profit, enough that they could afford to increase the wage they pay their workers. Hanes, for example:\n\n&gt; Haiti has about 25,000 garment workers. If you paid each of them $2 a day more, it would cost their employers $50,000 per working day, or about $12.5 million a year ... As of last year Hanes had 3,200 Haitians making t-shirts for it. Paying each of them two bucks a day more would cost it about $1.6 million a year. Hanesbrands Incorporated made $211 million on $4.3 billion in sales last year.\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/wikileaks-haiti-minimum-wage-the-nation-2011-6\n\nNow, Haiti could increase their minimum wage, but they run the risk of losing the small amount of business they already have. In contrast, the United States and other Western nations could establish standards that they refuse to import goods that are produced under conditions such as these. In response, companies would have no other option but to take the hit on their bottom line, or raise their prices for Western consumers, and that would effectively raise the quality of life of workers throughout the third world.\n\nI would be willing to bet it would be almost universally beneficial for Western nations to establish these standards. If foreign companies wanted access to Western markets, they would need to meet those standards.\n\nAdmittedly there are other issues with this, for instance it could be seen as elitist because certain Americans maybe \"rely\" on cheaper goods, however when it comes to the amount of relieved suffering worldwide I don't think there is any comparison.", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sanemaniac", "id": "t1_cewhobn", "parent_id": "t1_cewheql", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1432064240, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cewhobn", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1390443833", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "FacelessBureaucrat", "id": "t1_cewheql", "parent_id": "t1_cewh9q2", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1432064103, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; Because it is their best option does not mean that it is a good option.\n \nThat's not the question.

With that hardline a stance, this conversation's not likely to be productive. Nevertheless.\n\n&gt;But Israel can be allowed to use white phosphorous...\n\n(And Saddam can gas Kurds, and etc., etc.)\n\nSo because we've made the mistake of *not* intervening in prior crises of this nature (including regulating our own behavior), we should go ahead and make the same mistake again?\n\n&gt;This is about power...\n\nHow so? The U.S. loses quite a bit of leverage with a military intervention of any sort in Syria. Right now Iran and Hezbollah, two parties the U.S. wish to be less powerful, are pumping men and materiel into the fight on the Syrian government's side. It's in our interest to keep those guys busy fighting the rebels (who we're supplying) and draining their own resources.\n\n*Not* intervening would mean this conflict drags on, to our benefit. But even enforcing a no-fly zone allows the rebels to advance, and they are a very diverse group, including moderates, but also radical Islamists who would be more prepared to take control of Syria should Assad's government fall. You can't be arguing that another non-democratic Islamic state in the middle east would be in the U.S.'s interest. Assad at least was a known and stable quantity.\n\n&gt;Opposing terrorism cannot continue to be an excuse...\n\nBecause of your inherent bias you're incapable of seeing the very real security threat posed (to everyone) by chemical weapons in the hands of Islamic extremists. This *can be used* as a fear tactic, but don't confuse rhetoric with reality. Most people, regardless of nationality, don't want these weapons a) around at all, b) definitely not in the hands of unaccountable non-state actors. Who's going to see to that?\n\n&gt;Crisis is not laying it on thick...\n\nSemantic arguments aside, your initial claim was basically that we couldn't afford it, when, in fact, we absolutely *can* afford it. That particular line of reasoning is invalid.\n\n&gt;we need to STOP meddling in the affairs of foreign nations before we get our own in order.\n\nSo once we get our affairs straightened out, *then* it'd be okay to intervene in Syria? And when does this date come, that we've fixed all our problems at home? Won't more problems crop up? Couldn't you make this exact same argument in a decade's time and be just as \"right?\" It's the same argument as \"We shouldn't go to space until we've fixed the problems on earth,\" and it's equally invalid.\n\n&gt;It's not us, it's they...\n\nMore semantic quibbling. When I say \"us\", I clearly mean the United States of America. So. If it's *not* the United States of America, then who is it? Because these things *do* matter. You need some substantial-enough force from some nation that can enforce international agreements, especially if no other body is capable of doing so. It'd be nice if the U.N. could fill that role, but the U.N. couldn't even get behind stopping a genocide that everyone knew was happening in Kosovo.\n\nIf the U.N. agreed to intervene in Syria with a multinational force (perhaps not even including the U.S.), would that be okay? Why, or why not?\n\n&gt;It's the politicians and power-seekers who use this for their own benefit \n\nMaybe you can lay out for me exactly who these politicians and power-seekers are that are using this crisis for their own benefit, and *how* they are going to benefit.\n\n&gt;the vast, vast majority of American people have no connection whatsoever.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans may believe that they have no connection with events happening halfway around the globe, but they would be incorrect.

With that hardline a stance, this conversation's not likely to be productive. Nevertheless.\n\n&gt;But Israel can be allowed to use white phosphorous...\n\n(And Saddam can gas Kurds, and etc., etc.)\n\nSo because we've made the mistake of *not* intervening in prior crises of this nature (including regulating our own behavior), we should go ahead and make the same mistake again?\n\n&gt;This is about power...\n\nHow so? The U.S. loses quite a bit of leverage with a military intervention of any sort in Syria. Right now Iran and Hezbollah, two parties the U.S. wish to be less powerful, are pumping men and materiel into the fight on the Syrian government's side. It's in our interest to keep those guys busy fighting the rebels (who we're supplying) and draining their own resources.\n\n*Not* intervening would mean this conflict drags on, to our benefit. But even enforcing a no-fly zone allows the rebels to advance, and they are a very diverse group, including moderates, but also radical Islamists who would be more prepared to take control of Syria should Assad's government fall. You can't be arguing that another non-democratic Islamic state in the middle east would be in the U.S.'s interest. Assad at least was a known and stable quantity.\n\n&gt;Opposing terrorism cannot continue to be an excuse...\n\nBecause of your inherent bias you're incapable of seeing the very real security threat posed (to everyone) by chemical weapons in the hands of Islamic extremists. This *can be used* as a fear tactic, but don't confuse rhetoric with reality. Most people, regardless of nationality, don't want these weapons a) around at all, b) definitely not in the hands of unaccountable non-state actors. Who's going to see to that?\n\n&gt;Crisis is not laying it on thick...\n\nSemantic arguments aside, your initial claim was basically that we couldn't afford it, when, in fact, we absolutely *can* afford it. That particular line of reasoning is invalid.\n\n&gt;we need to STOP meddling in the affairs of foreign nations before we get our own in order.\n\nSo once we get our affairs straightened out, *then* it'd be okay to intervene in Syria? And when does this date come, that we've fixed all our problems at home? Won't more problems crop up? Couldn't you make this exact same argument in a decade's time and be just as \"right?\" It's the same argument as \"We shouldn't go to space until we've fixed the problems on earth,\" and it's equally invalid.\n\n&gt;It's not us, it's they...\n\nMore semantic quibbling. When I say \"us\", I clearly mean the United States of America. So. If it's *not* the United States of America, then who is it? Because these things *do* matter. You need some substantial-enough force from some nation that can enforce international agreements, especially if no other body is capable of doing so. It'd be nice if the U.N. could fill that role, but the U.N. couldn't even get behind stopping a genocide that everyone knew was happening in Kosovo.\n\nIf the U.N. agreed to intervene in Syria with a multinational force (perhaps not even including the U.S.), would that be okay? Why, or why not?\n\n&gt;It's the politicians and power-seekers who use this for their own benefit \n\nMaybe you can lay out for me exactly who these politicians and power-seekers are that are using this crisis for their own benefit, and *how* they are going to benefit.\n\n&gt;the vast, vast majority of American people have no connection whatsoever.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans may believe that they have no connection with events happening halfway around the globe, but they would be incorrect. Stability in the middle east, which does frequently come at the cost of liberties for its inhabitants, is absolutely critical to the stability of the global economy through its oil supplies. Americans are very much connected to that.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1l6243", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cbw7z55", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1377606332", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cbw776s", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1429684932, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cbw7m2y", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1377604278", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cbw70fe", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429685124, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;That's the same WMD argument that Bush used for war with Iraq\n\nYou say that as though not finding WMD in Iraq invalidates the argument in the case of Syria, where we're sitting on a fresh case of WMD usage.\n\n&gt;feel it necessary to prevent other nations from arming themselves as well.\n\nWe feel it necessary to prevent other nations from *using chemical weapons* (not *arming themselves*). As a U.N. member state, Syria's subject to the Chemical Weapons Ban. They can't be allowed to use them.\n\n&gt;On top of that, it's not in the interest of the average American.\n\nDepends. If, for instance, Syria's government were to fall to the rebels, it'd be in a lot of nations' interest to keep radical elements within the rebellion from seizing those weapons, and potentially selling them to various terrorist organizations. (Or using them themselves.) There's a sense in which a full-scale military intervention (which would allow an international force to safeguard those weapons) is more in the interest of Americans than a mere no-fly zone would be.\n\n&gt;We are in a financial crisis right now\n\nWe're not, really. Not doing as well as we could be or should be, sure, but \"crisis\" is laying it on a bit thick. Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, put the cost of such an intervention at over a [billion dollars a month](http://www.kvia.com/news/Dempsey-Action-in-Syria-would-cost-billions/-/391068/21119374/-/p4r7wgz/-/index.html), which is pretty much pocket change to the American government.

Those must be enforced and upheld, by as broad a coalition as can be put together (either inside or outside the U.N., and in the case of Syria (as with Lybia) probably by NATO.)\n\nThe U.S. is the only nation with the economic capability and military prowess to *be* the world's policeman. And such a role absolutely needs to be filled by somebody. States with power have an obligation in that regard. Which is not the same as saying it will always be done correctly.\n\n(And just to be clear, I think there are plenty of really excellent reasons *not* to intervene in Syria, but no one in this thread is using them.)\n", "edited": 1377601902, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1l6243", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cbw776s", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1377601534", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cbw6mui", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429685213, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cbw70fe", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1377600083", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

With that hardline a stance, this conversation's not likely to be productive. Nevertheless.\n\n&gt;But Israel can be allowed to use white phosphorous...\n\n(And Saddam can gas Kurds, and etc., etc.)\n\nSo because we've made the mistake of *not* intervening in prior crises of this nature (including regulating our own behavior), we should go ahead and make the same mistake again?\n\n&gt;This is about power...\n\nHow so? The U.S. loses quite a bit of leverage with a military intervention of any sort in Syria. Right now Iran and Hezbollah, two parties the U.S. wish to be less powerful, are pumping men and materiel into the fight on the Syrian government's side. It's in our interest to keep those guys busy fighting the rebels (who we're supplying) and draining their own resources.\n\n*Not* intervening would mean this conflict drags on, to our benefit. But even enforcing a no-fly zone allows the rebels to advance, and they are a very diverse group, including moderates, but also radical Islamists who would be more prepared to take control of Syria should Assad's government fall. You can't be arguing that another non-democratic Islamic state in the middle east would be in the U.S.'s interest. Assad at least was a known and stable quantity.\n\n&gt;Opposing terrorism cannot continue to be an excuse...\n\nBecause of your inherent bias you're incapable of seeing the very real security threat posed (to everyone) by chemical weapons in the hands of Islamic extremists. This *can be used* as a fear tactic, but don't confuse rhetoric with reality. Most people, regardless of nationality, don't want these weapons a) around at all, b) definitely not in the hands of unaccountable non-state actors. Who's going to see to that?\n\n&gt;Crisis is not laying it on thick...\n\nSemantic arguments aside, your initial claim was basically that we couldn't afford it, when, in fact, we absolutely *can* afford it. That particular line of reasoning is invalid.\n\n&gt;we need to STOP meddling in the affairs of foreign nations before we get our own in order.\n\nSo once we get our affairs straightened out, *then* it'd be okay to intervene in Syria? And when does this date come, that we've fixed all our problems at home? Won't more problems crop up? Couldn't you make this exact same argument in a decade's time and be just as \"right?\" It's the same argument as \"We shouldn't go to space until we've fixed the problems on earth,\" and it's equally invalid.\n\n&gt;It's not us, it's they...\n\nMore semantic quibbling. When I say \"us\", I clearly mean the United States of America. So. If it's *not* the United States of America, then who is it? Because these things *do* matter. You need some substantial-enough force from some nation that can enforce international agreements, especially if no other body is capable of doing so. It'd be nice if the U.N. could fill that role, but the U.N. couldn't even get behind stopping a genocide that everyone knew was happening in Kosovo.\n\nIf the U.N. agreed to intervene in Syria with a multinational force (perhaps not even including the U.S.), would that be okay? Why, or why not?\n\n&gt;It's the politicians and power-seekers who use this for their own benefit \n\nMaybe you can lay out for me exactly who these politicians and power-seekers are that are using this crisis for their own benefit, and *how* they are going to benefit.\n\n&gt;the vast, vast majority of American people have no connection whatsoever.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans may believe that they have no connection with events happening halfway around the globe, but they would be incorrect.

First, what \"social factors\" are you referring to? Also, do you think that the drug laws would still be on the books if they were implemented in such a way that they actually targeted illegal drug use/sales? Seems to me like those laws are mostly used to target undesirables. The drug laws don't need to have been designed to discriminate to be, in reality, discriminatory. If lawmakers and people in the executive turn a blind eye (or worse) to the way these laws are used, then they are, in a sense, retroactively imbuing them with racist/classist/... intent.\n\nAnother, related way of looking at it is that laws are always disproportionately used against the weak and the undesirables. The drug laws (especially when combined with 3-strikes laws) are just so draconian that the pernicious effects are amplified.

There's also a justified worry that a private citizen would never be able to afford to bring a law suit to a large company or corporation, and so the free market would just run wild. That's also addressed in a libertarian judicial system. Since one of the very few roles of government we believe in is protecting citizens from those who have caused them harm, the victim would be represented by the government. Like a public defender, but with the resources of the DoJ. This puts private citizens on par with big companies, putting one giant up against another. In the case of real, monetary damages, strong property rights will trump federal regulation every time.\n\nBut you mention a good point that not all pollution can be quantified by a monetary damage. The difference here is between compensation vs restitution. You sue the company that dumps garbage on your land for compensation for the actual monetary damage done. It covers your losses. But in the case of air pollution for example, where you might not have incurred a monetary injury, you would still sue for restitution. This is in place precisely to punish the offending polluter. They've committed an act of aggression against you by putting pollutants in the air you breathe against your will. Theft is still theft, whether its stealing a nickel or a $100. And aggression is still aggression whether they put bad shit in the air or break your leg. So pretend you're a company in the middle of a neighborhood pumping all sorts of nasty chemicals in the air. Every single person in that neighborhood has a claim against you, both for compensation and restitution, and their case is represented by the government. Every time you do this, they have a new claim against you. They continue to sue, they continue to win. Your prices skyrocket. Either you need to charge more, in which case you'll lose so many customers you go out of business, or you innovate your energy system so it doesn't cause the reason you're being sued.

I've found that when people purposefully identify themselves as socialists, they are making a stark distinction between that and liberalism. \n\nAnyway, the libertarian judicial system is not the same as the system we currently have. First, there would be less, simpler laws. We wouldn't need a thousand different laws that say \"don't fuck this guy over\". We'd have one law that said it. It also reduces and can eliminate many of the loop holes defense attorney's rely on now to win their case. Most of the time it's not that they proved their client didn't do something wrong, they just got away based on a technicality. That's an important factor that needs to be addressed. There's also a justified worry that a private citizen would never be able to afford to bring a law suit to a large company or corporation, and so the free market would just run wild. That's also addressed in a libertarian judicial system. Since one of the very few roles of government we believe in is protecting citizens from those who have caused them harm, the victim would be represented by the government. Like a public defender, but with the resources of the DoJ. This puts private citizens on par with big companies, putting one giant up against another. In the case of real, monetary damages, strong property rights will trump federal regulation every time.\n\nBut you mention a good point that not all pollution can be quantified by a monetary damage. The difference here is between compensation vs restitution. You sue the company that dumps garbage on your land for compensation for the actual monetary damage done. It covers your losses. But in the case of air pollution for example, where you might not have incurred a monetary injury, you would still sue for restitution. This is in place precisely to punish the offending polluter. They've committed an act of aggression against you by putting pollutants in the air you breathe against your will. Theft is still theft, whether its stealing a nickel or a $100. And aggression is still aggression whether they put bad shit in the air or break your leg. So pretend you're a company in the middle of a neighborhood pumping all sorts of nasty chemicals in the air. Every single person in that neighborhood has a claim against you, both for compensation and restitution, and their case is represented by the government. Every time you do this, they have a new claim against you. They continue to sue, they continue to win. Your prices skyrocket. Either you need to charge more, in which case you'll lose so many customers you go out of business, or you innovate your energy system so it doesn't cause the reason you're being sued. But you won't be able to maintain the model of polluting all you want and continuing to pay the victims without having to alter anything. It's completely unsustainable. \n\nLook, it's never going to happen. So debating this too much and too passionately is going to be a waste of time pretty soon. I happen to think that an entire population with the prosecution powers of the Department of Justice threatening to sue a polluter has a lot more teeth, than just implementing a fine if they pollute more than the law says they can. I think it hits them a lot harder where it hurts, and much more often. But yes, it largely depends on a huge change with our judicial system.

If the plaintiff does manage to win a years-long court case that has probably devastated them economically, then the company merely sees that as a cost of business.

To libertarians, the environment, divided into properties, belongs to man. If that person's property is injured by a company's pollution and they settle out of court, the matter is resolved. *You* might not like the outcome the property owner agreed to, but it's not your property to worry about, so it's not your business. Listen, it's not an ideology for everyone. We don't expect everyone to like it, and we certainly don't expect everyone to believe it's the one and true answer. That being said, I don't particularly like the system you favor. Right now all a company has to do is pay a few fines (pretty insignificant ones at that), plant some trees to offset their carbon footprint (or just outright buy them from someone else!), and they can continue polluting the environment all they want. You have inspections and penalties already established, and yet here we are, with companies still polluting every day. Your solution fails drastically. Look at BP. They had inspections and threat of penalties. They didn't stop anything. You know what got their ass in gear? Being sued. The only downside is (unlike what would be in a libertarian society), there's a very short statute of limitations, and so many people who were injured by the spill won't be able to sue for compensation. That's a shame. But the even bigger irony to me is the desire to put our faith in protecting the environment in the hands of the planet's WORST polluter, the U.S. Federal Government. That's like asking the Japanese to be in charge of cracking down on whaling! You can't expect the government to do a good job coming up with inspections and fines when they're the worst offender.

I've repeatedly informed you that this same process is occurring today in many countries abroad. This is not just a historical example from America. In America however, the historical example does apply. The court system is still convoluted and drawn-out, class action cases can still take decades, companies STILL only are made to pay damages that amount to a fraction of what they've done, and companies still pay people off and avoid these cases at all costs.

I've found that when people purposefully identify themselves as socialists, they are making a stark distinction between that and liberalism. \n\nAnyway, the libertarian judicial system is not the same as the system we currently have. First, there would be less, simpler laws. We wouldn't need a thousand different laws that say \"don't fuck this guy over\". We'd have one law that said it. It also reduces and can eliminate many of the loop holes defense attorney's rely on now to win their case. Most of the time it's not that they proved their client didn't do something wrong, they just got away based on a technicality. That's an important factor that needs to be addressed. There's also a justified worry that a private citizen would never be able to afford to bring a law suit to a large company or corporation, and so the free market would just run wild. That's also addressed in a libertarian judicial system. Since one of the very few roles of government we believe in is protecting citizens from those who have caused them harm, the victim would be represented by the government. Like a public defender, but with the resources of the DoJ. This puts private citizens on par with big companies, putting one giant up against another. In the case of real, monetary damages, strong property rights will trump federal regulation every time.\n\nBut you mention a good point that not all pollution can be quantified by a monetary damage. The difference here is between compensation vs restitution. You sue the company that dumps garbage on your land for compensation for the actual monetary damage done. It covers your losses. But in the case of air pollution for example, where you might not have incurred a monetary injury, you would still sue for restitution. This is in place precisely to punish the offending polluter. They've committed an act of aggression against you by putting pollutants in the air you breathe against your will. Theft is still theft, whether its stealing a nickel or a $100. And aggression is still aggression whether they put bad shit in the air or break your leg. So pretend you're a company in the middle of a neighborhood pumping all sorts of nasty chemicals in the air. Every single person in that neighborhood has a claim against you, both for compensation and restitution, and their case is represented by the government. Every time you do this, they have a new claim against you. They continue to sue, they continue to win. Your prices skyrocket. Either you need to charge more, in which case you'll lose so many customers you go out of business, or you innovate your energy system so it doesn't cause the reason you're being sued. But you won't be able to maintain the model of polluting all you want and continuing to pay the victims without having to alter anything. It's completely unsustainable. \n\nLook, it's never going to happen. So debating this too much and too passionately is going to be a waste of time pretty soon. I happen to think that an entire population with the prosecution powers of the Department of Justice threatening to sue a polluter has a lot more teeth, than just implementing a fine if they pollute more than the law says they can. I think it hits them a lot harder where it hurts, and much more often. But yes, it largely depends on a huge change with our judicial system.

The problem with pollution in the real world is precisely that the individual damage caused by a single polluter (eg. one car or one factory) seems neglible, but the aggregated collective impact of many polluters (eg. lots of cars, or lots of factories) causes very real and dangerous problems. To the extent that you're talking only about pollution \"in a very obscene, measurable way,\" you're essentially admitting that the libertarian solution doesn't have an adequate response to the actual problems most typically associated with pollution, only to some simplistic caricature of the problem that exists only in your head.\n\n&gt; Second, I think an issue is your taking the country exactly as it is now, but throwing it under a libertarian government in the blink of an eye and saying, \"See! You can't fix this!\".

The problem now lies in determining who is the source of all this pollution? The courts will have information on all car's emission, and the same with factories. So instead of tracking down individual offenders, you go after the maker.\n\nThat doesn't address my point at all, which was that it is impractical to parse out *which polluters* caused the losses in question. You can have all the information you want about different cars' emission rates, but in any given lawsuit, how could the plaintiff possibly prove that he developed lung cancer (or whatever) because of the Mercury Sable as opposed to the Toyota Camry, the Dodge Ram, or the brother-in-law who smokes? Realistically, *all* of those pollutants, along with hundreds more, were present and probably each contributed some small effect. The harm also probably took place gradually, over a long period of time, which means lots of the polluters might no longer exist by the time the damage is noticed. How, then, could a plaintiff possibly prove the liability of any specific defendant? And, by extension, if the plaintiff cannot possibly prove definitively who caused the harm in question, what incentive do any of the polluters have to make changes? And remember, these are not artificial parameters I'm imagining or \"straw manning\" -- this is simply the nature of the problem you say you have a better solution to.\n\n&gt; Again, we're using the justice system as it stands today, rather than the one libertarians propose. Yeah, it wouldn't really work now because it's so incredibly expensive. No one would be able to afford a good lawyer, so companies would just go nuts over pollution. What's stopping them?

Lawyers will still exist, but mostly for the purposes of defense. And again, the law is really on your side. Libertarians are unflinching in their belief that you can't negatively affect someone else. Even a little.\n\nNothing about your solution meets those criteria, however. It's NOT much simpler for a layman to prove whether Toyota caused his cancer rather than Chevrolet or Marlboro than it is for the government to regulate how much of certain substances can be released into the air (or whatever). It's much, much more complex -- not only legalistically, but scientifically. We simply can't trace microscopic molecules back to their source with any degree of accuracy that would hold up in court. For the government to undertake such a task -- investigating the individual path histories of microscopic windborne and waterborne molecules, for hundreds of millions of people who are affected daily by pollution, multiplies by hundreds or more pollution sources that contribute to pollution in even just a small area, and then for each, standing up in court and spending countless hours trying to prove their conclusions beyond a reasonable doubt -- would be so complex, bloated, and expensive as to undermine the entire libertarian ideology if the task were even plausible in the first place (which I don't think it is).\n\n&gt; Finally, (you're straw-maning again) \n\nI am? Libertarians don't say we should de-regulate?\n\n&gt; passing a law that says don't pollute doesn't work. We have laws now that say don't pollute, does that mean we don't have a pollution problem anymore?\n\nThe US has extremely weak anti-pollution laws, many of which were written by the polluters themselves. Other countries have better anti-pollution laws and a smaller pollution problem. Your argument is equivalent to saying that since my old, sick, three-legged donkey does a mediocre job pulling his cart, donkeys *in general* can't pull carts. In reality, I may just need a better donkey.\n\nMoreover, we still have a murder problem even though we have laws against murder. We still have a rape problem even though we have laws against rape. It is a completely unreasonable standard to suggest that a policy doesn't work unless it entirely eliminates the problem. The pollution problem *has* gotten measurably *[better](http://www.aei-ideas.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/earthday1.jpg)* since we started regulating pollution better, which would lead most rational people to conclude that the laws do work -- though we can still recognize that our current laws are not necessarily the best possible ones.\n\n&gt; If Dodge still makes the Ram in our libertarian society, exactly the way it is now being the biggest polluting vehicle on the road- they are exposing themselves to lawsuits from the entire country. I'd say that's a hell of a lot worse than the nothing the face now for making a heavily polling vehicle.\n\nThat's only true if it's actually plausible to definitively connect a given defendant's loss specifically to the Dodge Ram itself. If that connection is prohibitively difficult to parse out, then Dodge has no incentive whatsoever to change its behavior in your libertarian society.

I never assumed or said that the new agency you create would be looking for lawsuits, rather my critique rests on the passive collection of information, that would be on a massive scale.\n\nYou open up litigation to everyone, I go to my public defender and want to sue GM for pollution. The new tracking agency is going to have to figure out the pollution that comes from GM vehicles, the production of GM vehicles, shipping them, how modifications affect their pollution levels (up or down), and then compare that to every other car manufacturer because not every car around me is GM rather pollution is caused by multiple factors. Now that new agency is going to have to figure out what portion of the pollution pie is just GM's responsibility and not VW, the coal plant next door, my neighbors smoking, or just hereditary. So even their passive collection of information for just me is going to touch on every individual that I pass in my morning commute, weekend trip, and any other time I leave my house. So yes if my twin brother who has lived with my since birth sues as well they can look at my data and use similar information in the lawsuit. BUT if anyone else wants to sue they basically have to start all over again and compile all of that data all over based on a new set of information. Now multiply that by 313.9 million people, with an infinite set of unique factors to consider, how does that not border on the draconian? If you are going to rely on the individual to sue rather than a government agency you have to have quite a few lawsuits to make any form of impact on their policy, a few lawsuits won't change anything, your theory basically requires that there are tons of lawsuits brought against every car maker to have any affect. Therefore, your new agency is going to be bustling with activity collecting and compiling just the data requested, which based on the nature of pollution (a combination of contributors rather than just one) is going to be massive in scale, they have to compile information on your daily routine to make sure the guilt is properly assigned to each polluting actor. \n\nThat is just cars. Now if we take say a coal powered energy plant the scale just expanded exponentially, not only do you have people within the immediate area of the plant but also those that were along the shipping route (trucks, barges, trains all pollute), everyone near the mine (that operation isn't clean), and everyone that was affected by wind blown pollution from the plant or any other step of the process. \n\nThat was just cars and coal plants, expand that to every single industrial practice in the united states and your solution becomes so unwieldy that it solves nothing and creates more problems. Even passively collecting information is going to become intrusive and large and you are going to create a culture of lawsuits that would basically grind business to a halt, they would be sued from every direction and would be spending more to defend themselves than actually functioning as a business.

Do you realize the scale of that idea? For cars alone you are going to have to track the use, mileage, depreciation of mileage over time, upkeep on all cars, modifications of the cars that affect mileage, how I drive my car, etc. Not to mention they are going to have to track every step in the chain of production, shipping, distribution, and sale of every car that pollutes, you realize the massive scale of that right? That doesn't sound like small government in the least bit, rather I think that borders on NSA level invasion of privacy. That would cost millions if not billions of dollars and manhours to implement, carry out, and upkeep. Think about your proposition, sorry that borders on the absurd.\n\nRather than having regulatory agencies with power to litigate you think we should all be able to sue people that pollute, and only when that pollution affects us. What defines affects us? You are going to have to figure out how someone died and if in the course of their life they were exposed to pollution that decreased their life span/contributed to their death. IF that is on the burden of the family, good luck having most people carry that out most are going to be too poor, lazy, or stupid to take the time to do so. Like most every other step you propose that is going to require a team of scientists to figure out the cause of death and how that was effected by pollution. IF that is on the shoulders of the government to figure out, again I challenge the idea that this is a libertarian idea at all since it would result in a massive expansion of government to track, litigate, and process all of this information. On this same topic how do we figure out who polluted and what percentage of the \"pollution pie\" they are responsible for? The individual is going to have to hire an army of statisticians and scientists to track that information and to put it into a form they can understand (since you argue I, not my attorney, will be taking them to court... a problem I will address later). How is that manageable in any way? Not only are you expecting people to pay for their own legal team or take the case to court themselves ( a laughable idea) but you are expecting them to do all the required research to argue their case. You are creating institutional barriers to litigation every step of the way. Even if that information is available from the NPA (national pollution agency, you would be creating it) you are going to require people to process the information themselves and to sift through the mountain of information for data that relates to their case as well, and you expect people to do this in their free time after working 40 hours a week? Do you assume that no one has anything to do after working all day or do you assume that people are all legal and data crunching machines that would be able to create a well crafted legal argument in their sleep?\n\nYou claim that people are going to be able to defend themselves because the law will be so simple anyone can bring a lawsuit...your system just put millions of attorneys out of business and created a business environment where every company (big or small) has to fear and prepare for countless lawsuits from everyone (remember according to you, if pollution affected you then you can sue). You basically ran businesses out of business by creating a litigious system that makes our current epoch look tame. You also just created an environment where Big company A can sue little company B for pollution, or find a plaintiff to sue through, and basically run smaller companies out of business through litigation.\n\nYou said we are going to have our own justice department? What on the earth does that mean? You seem to be creating a massive legal bureaucracy rather than simplifying things in anyway. \n\nYour statement on the libertarian ethos that you can't negatively affect anyone. Where is the line? Like I said above you are going to require people to sue every step in the chain of production for restitution of damages.\n\nSorry but your idea borders on the crazy. Instead of simplifying things your system will make it so dangerous to do business, of any kind really, that you are going to destroy private business. Your system is even more litigious than our current system and creates a toxic and fearful business environment that would do more harm than good. I don't think you have considered the scale or scope of pollution in relation to your libertarian dream, if you did I believe you would reconsider.

If you are taking on a multimillion(billion even) dollar company you want a damn good attorney. \n\nCompany X has great attorneys that are on call 24/7 for situations like this, that is their bread and butter they are experts in environmental and tort law. You on the other hand make (let's say the median income in the United States of $50,000). You now have to (A) find an environmental/tort lawyer that is able and willing to take on company X (B) have the time to work with your attorney to get the case ready (they do much of the work but with a 40 hour work week for you, that is going to chew up a good bit of your free time) (C) you have to have the funds to pay your attorney to research the case, argue the case, argue the appeal of the case (you win they are going to appeal, you lose I assume you would want to appeal as well).\n\nThe problem is that this gets very expensive very fast. Unless you have an attorney that wants to fight this case probono or a legal group that wants to represent you for free the \"libertarian court system\" solves nothing. It might even make more sense to the company, if we limited environmental laws and rather relied on the tort system instead as I believe you are implying, to pollute (safe and responsible removal and destruction of waste is expensive) and just settle lawsuits against them. If it costs them $2 million to dispose of chemical Y (causes cancer, AIDS, birth defects, and general unhappiness) but they can use settle a suit for $1.9 million with you for dumping it in your lake why the heck not? No the libertarian court system does not solve this problem rather it enables companies to pollute more when effective and still hampers the ability of average citizens to fight pollution.\n\nLoopholes are not the problem at all, the problem rather is that we have weak protections for the environment and hamper the ability of government agencies tasked with protecting us to do their job. Tort law in the US is actually pretty good at enabling us to go after polluters (in theory, but reality is much different), the problem is that companies can settle a case for millions and still make a profit, or just fight you into the ground until you give up or accept their settlement. Instead of foolishly relying on me to take on billiondollarcorp, they can and will beat me 99% of the time for reasons I said above, we need to enable governments, who (should) have the time, money, expertise, and ability to go after companies that are polluting. If you actually want to prevent companies from polluting you need to enable those who can go after companies to do so.

Congress however has both control over the coin and rules and government of our land and naval forces (Article 1, Section 8). So he could theoretically order everyone home, but Congress has the power to, say, deny those funds necessary for such a draw-down.\n\nBeyond that, there's huge political and foreign policy considerations in doing any of these things. Afghanistan, for example. No matter whether you agree we should still be there. If we just up and left tomorrow then the Afghani government would fall. And for all the shit we did, we owe it to them to make the transition as smooth as possible. Of course, when it comes to Iraq and Afghanistan we have all but, and will soon, respectively, remove our troops from the country, so it's really a question of waiting with these countries. Further, there are some bases that might still be in our interests. Our bases in S. Korea, for example, might be one of the few things keeping Pyongyang from turning Seoul into a crater. \n\nFinally, there are also huge logistical problems. If we returned hundreds of thousands of US troops home we'd have to find a place to house all of them, ways to feed all of them, and ways to fit them all in the US or ways to process them all for discharges. \n\n-Guantanamo. Partially-paywalled article: http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/136781/carol-rosenberg/why-obama-cant-close-guantanamo.\n\nGenerally, there's no place to put many of them. Again, the President can't just close the base because Congress controls it. Further, you can either let the prisoners go or you send them somewhere else. While the innocence of some prisoners there seems certain, there are still those who still might be guilty. So you can't let them all go. So you can either send them to the US or another country. Thanks to acts of Congress controlling funding, there is no place in the US for them to be housed. And there would be no court trials for them because Congress controls the jurisdictions of the courts, as well as their funding. Other countries are possibilities, but you have to find the right ones. They need to go to a country that's a)willing-- remember most of these guys, even if innocent, were probably associating with some shady people in order to be noticed in the first place, and that I can't think of a better way to radicalize me than to imprison me without charge or trial for a decade-- and b) secure enough to handle them. So you end up with this morass. \n\n-Finally, unwarranted surveillance of American citizens, and detention without due process, both have occurred under the Patriot Act and the NDAA. Could Obama unilaterally dismantle the NSA and the DHS without congressional approval?\n\nAs Executive Agencies the President has enormous control over the NSA and the DHS. He is their Boss and could, for example, make any use of the FISA court/wiretapping/whatever illegal per Executive Order. He could also just ask them not to do it. Of course, Congress could make that such an expensive proposition (i.e. if you tell the NSA to stop doing this then we will not fund the entire Dept. of Agriculture) that it makes no sense to do it.", "id": "t1_camjwic", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "jimibabay", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1gpfo4", "score": 7, "retrieved_on": 1430746879, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_camjwic", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1371713444", "ups": 7, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1gpfo4", "selftext": "&gt; What exactly can Obama accomplish by unilateral action w/ regard to Guantanamo,\n\nClose it.\n\n&gt; the wars abroad,\n\nEnd them.\n\n&gt; general military presence abroad,\n\nShut down bases, bring troops home.\n\n&gt; and surveillance of American citizens?\n\nTurn it off.\n\nAll of those are within his power, today.

Second, these factory jobs WERE exploitative and the American labor movement WAS born out of these conditions.  The WFM (Western Federation of Miners) only existed because of the working conditions that they faced, and the tight control over their lives by mine owners and operators.  This is a matter of historical fact, I don't understand how you could possibly deny it.\n\nMerely because workers left farm work to go to industrial work does not mean that the industrial work was safe and that these workers had high qualities of life.  In many cases the exact opposite was the case, and that is why unions and the labor movement surged in popularity at the time.\n\n&gt; no, it didn't. living standards for the poorest massively increased in the gilded age. the got lights, running water, and cars all for the first time. \n\nThere were technological advances that caused general increases in quality of life, but there was also extreme inequality of wealth and examples of extreme exploitation.\n\n&gt; While economic and political elites capitalized on America's rapidly expanding wealth, industrial workers struggled to survive the bleak conditions often hidden behind the nation's glittering fa\u00e7ade. Industrial wages were low and hours were long in factories that were typically dangerous and unhealthy. But perhaps worse, the restructuring of work\u2014the subdivision of labor into its unskilled parts\u2014left many workers with few marketable skills and little hope for occupational or social mobility. One consequence of all this was a budding labor movement, as workers banded together to try to force their collective will upon the industrial giants that had dominated them as individuals. Workers' efforts to organize frequently led to long and violent strikes, rocking the economic landscape and even raising the frightening specter of outright class warfare. http://www.shmoop.com/gilded-age/summary.html\n\nIt's fact.  Unions did not come out of nowhere.\n\n&gt; this talking point has been around for years and is completely idiotic. the financial crisis started in pure investment banks, not hybrids, and was ended when the hybrids bought out the investment banks. the only think you can say about GLB is that it made the crisis LESS bad.\n\n&gt; it did no such thing. can you even tell me what GLB did, without looking it up? Or how many other countries had a similar law to glass steagall?\n\nI don't appreciate the condescending quiz, but it allowed for consolidation of financial services entities.  That is a form of deregulation because it allowed companies to act in ways that they had not been allowed to act since the great depression.  The rebranding of this as a form of regulation of the financial industry is what is completely ridiculous.  It is apparent right now that the financial services industry has a huge amount of influence in Washington and can pretty much shape regulation in the way it wants.  Regardless, GLB was a form of deregulation and allowed unprecedented consolidation in banking.\n\n&gt; implementation began in 2004.\n\nimplementation was being discussed in 2004.\n\n&gt; i didn't say it was.

This is a matter of historical fact, I don't understand how you could possibly deny it.\n\nMerely because workers left farm work to go to industrial work does not mean that the industrial work was safe and that these workers had high qualities of life.

Industrial wages were low and hours were long in factories that were typically dangerous and unhealthy. But perhaps worse, the restructuring of work\u2014the subdivision of labor into its unskilled parts\u2014left many workers with few marketable skills and little hope for occupational or social mobility. One consequence of all this was a budding labor movement, as workers banded together to try to force their collective will upon the industrial giants that had dominated them as individuals.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "The idea that taxes are theft is a common libertarian line. It's kind of a complicated issue because you could argue that if a government is not sufficiently representative of the people, then taxes could easily be perceived as theft. On the other hand if you live in a functioning democracy, taxes could be seen as a completely legitimate agreement arrived at through the democratic process. Taxes fund schools, libraries, national defense, and infrastructure maintenance for sewage systems, roads, water, and electricity. Without these things the average citizen would certainly be worse off.\n\nThat is what I normally say to libertarians. I want freedom too, but I want a functioning and properly representative democratic system. If a certain tax rate is agreed upon through this process, then I view it as legitimate and not theft. Not only that but without taxation, basic services would be difficult to fund and we would all suffer as a result.\n\nI like to point to Gilded Age America (post civil war) as an example of a market in which regulation is almost totally absent. This era had extreme wealth inequality and the worst living and working conditions for the average American than nearly any other time in American history. The weekend and the 8 hour day, and an active labor movement, were born out of these conditions.\n\nThe issue of minimum wage is interesting. The economic argument is that minimum wage increases barriers to entry and makes it more difficult for businesses to succeed, as well as raising the price that the market would set for a wage if left alone. Minimum wage exists because without it, people would have trouble accessing basic necessities like shelter, food, education, and health care. So it is an indirect way of ensuring that people have a basic quality of life, and it's a form of wealth redistribution. Again, before the minimum wage there were egregious examples of worker exploitation and abuse. So ultimately I see it as an indirect way of providing the basic necessities to people and forcing some degree of wealth-sharing between employers and employees. There is a labor surplus always for unskilled labor and therefore without unions, labor has very little ability to negotiate for higher wages. In that sense minimum wage really does protect the little guy.\n\nAnyways I'm sorry if this was a little scattered, I hope there was some helpful information.\n\nAlso re: government intervention causing the 2008 financial crisis, that is completely bogus. The problem was a lack of government oversight and deregulation of the financial industry, allowing investment banks and ratings agencies to act completely irresponsibly and knowingly sell debt packages that had no backing.

The reason we have a bill of rights is so that certain individual rights can't be violated just because of a majority vote.  The question here is what is the alternative?  Improving our democratic system and making it genuinely representative of the people is our only hope of having some degree of control over our own destiny.  What would you prefer my friend?  That we turn our destiny over to the private sector and hope that our environment is maintained and people have a decent quality of life?  This possibility has been disproven by our own history in America.\n\n&gt; no, they were born out of an increasingly wealth society that could afford to work less. \n\nThe American labor movement was born out of unsafe working conditions and exploitative employers.  This is not questionable, it is a matter of historical fact.  Look up the Western Federation of Miners.  This union was born out of company towns in Colorado where owners owned the housing the workers lived in, the equipment they used, and the stores they shopped in.  This resulted in perpetual debt for many workers which was equivalent to slavery.  Children as young as 10 worked in these mines and lost limbs or died early due to lung disease from working in the mines.\n\nIt makes no difference how much wealth is being generated if that wealth is concentrated only in the upper echelons, and this is what existed in the Gilded Age.  There is a book called Standing at Armageddon about this era that I recommend you read, it is a nonideological look at the workers' movements of this era.

Second, these factory jobs WERE exploitative and the American labor movement WAS born out of these conditions.  The WFM (Western Federation of Miners) only existed because of the working conditions that they faced, and the tight control over their lives by mine owners and operators.  This is a matter of historical fact, I don't understand how you could possibly deny it.\n\nMerely because workers left farm work to go to industrial work does not mean that the industrial work was safe and that these workers had high qualities of life.

Industrial wages were low and hours were long in factories that were typically dangerous and unhealthy. But perhaps worse, the restructuring of work\u2014the subdivision of labor into its unskilled parts\u2014left many workers with few marketable skills and little hope for occupational or social mobility. One consequence of all this was a budding labor movement, as workers banded together to try to force their collective will upon the industrial giants that had dominated them as individuals. Workers' efforts to organize frequently led to long and violent strikes, rocking the economic landscape and even raising the frightening specter of outright class warfare. http://www.shmoop.com/gilded-age/summary.html\n\nIt's fact.

Why should it be a political concern for us; why not leave the issue entirely to the scientists?\n\nTwo reasons we have already mentioned; to celebrate the victory of freedom of inquiry and of truth for its own sake; and a bullet through the heart of the egalitarian-socialist project. But there is a third reason as well: as a powerful defense of the results of the free market. **If and when we as populists and libertarians abolish the welfare state in all of its aspects, and property rights and the free market shall be triumphant once more, many individuals and groups will predictably not like the end result. In that case, those ethnic and other groups who might be concentrated in lower-income or less prestigious occupations, guided by their socialistic mentors, will predictably raise the cry that free-market capitalism is evil and \"discriminatory\" and that therefore collectivism is needed to redress the balance. In that case, the *intelligence argument* will become useful to defend the market economy and the free society from ignorant or self-serving attacks.** In short; racialist science is properly not an act of aggression or a cover for oppression of one group over another, but, on the contrary, an operation in defense of private property against assaults by aggressors.\n\nIn any case, there is cause for jubilation these days, for it looks as if the left-egalitarian blackout-and-smear gang has been dealt a truly lethal blow.\" (my bold and italic)\nhttp://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/ir/Ch75.html", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bkbro", "selftext": "You can toss about all the *ad hominem* attacks all you want, but he'll study Austrian economics at some point during college with either of those majors (I'd hope, anyways).

One interesting example of this was the Populist movement who had a base of farmers in the Mid-West that were struggling from excessive abuse by banking, a crop lien system, etc.  They found that they were not achieving adequate representation among the two central parties (at a time of real economic need) and this caused them to seek out a different outlet.  This led to the People's Party.  They gained many representatives in Congress and ultimately the organization threw its weight behind William Jennings Bryan in 1904 (a controversial decision--some members saw Bryan as not adequately representative of the interests of farmers).  This election is famous because wealthy industrialists and financial elites in the Northeast recognized the threat from Bryan and funded Woodrow Wilson to the tune of 5 million dollars, which was four or five times the amount Bryan was able to raise.  Bryan failed and the Party fell apart due to infighting afterwards.\n\nThere has rarely ever been a third party in America that has been successful in any significant way.  I actually think that this is the source of our woes in America for the last century.  Business funds politicians of both parties, who are then beholden to those businesses, and the people do not have a choice except to choose the lesser evil.
