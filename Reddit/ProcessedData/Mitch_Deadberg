Republicans had just swept many state legislatures and redrew most district lines in a way that would outwardly favor Republican candidates -- this is called gerrymandering. [[Check out CGP Grey's video on the topic if you're unfamiliar.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mky11UJb9AY)]\n\nSo, now the GOP knows that these gerrymandered districts will always* go to the Republican candidate. That makes the primary process the decider of which candidate will represent that district. Unfortunately for the GOP, voter turnout for primary elections is very low -- typically only die-hard, hyper-conservative (or hyper-liberal for democratic primaries) voters are deciding who will win the primary. \n\nNow we have a hyper-conservative base deciding who will be the Republican candidate in a general election that the GOP candidate is guaranteed to win. If the Tea Party decides to challenge an incumbent official because they believe that Representative is not adequately standing up to the Left, that official will most certainly be replaced by a Tea Party ~~candidate~~ Representative.\n\nSo, if Boehner *doesn't* heed the demands of the Tea Party clamoring for discord and obstinance and the repeal of \"Obamacare\", not only is he sure to face a very real threat in his 2014 reelection bid, but he will most likely lose his Speakership. The same can be said for any other Republican seeking reelection next year. \n\nThis kind of hostage-taking has created an existential crisis for the party that we are only now seeing the Old Guard of the GOP finally taking a stand against. With the Republicans very obviously taking the blame for the shutdown, very obviously losing ground in the opinion polls, and the very real threat of another rout reminiscent of the 1998 elections following the first shutdown, the OG of the GOP is finally seeing that being chained to the Tea Party's demands is a failing strategy. \n\n-----\nObama's position is a lot easier to understand. From his perspective, he has been pitted against an irrational, hyper-conservative House whose singular goal for three years has been to defund or delegitimize his signature healthcare law. If he negotiates on *anything* during this crisis, if he concedes a single policy position, if he shows the smallest iota of weakness to the Tea Party, they'll refuse to allow him to do anything for the rest of his term. They're position will be legitimized, their tactics will continue, and -- from his perspective -- the country will be doomed. \n\n-----\nSo, who wins in a default? No one. The treasury markets are destabilized, every piece of the financial world is tied to the t-bill rate in some way or another. If the financial markets sense any amount of risk in that market (treasury bills have traditionally been considered \"risk-free\" investments), they the rest of the global economy will be destabilized. \n\n-----\nWho has the most to gain from a default? The Tea Party. Their expressed goal has been to reduce government. Their main tactic has been to show how inefficient and ineffective it is at solving problems by making it impossible for the federal government -- and many state governments -- to solve problems.", "id": "t1_ccr01pc", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Mitch_Deadberg", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "The tea party would be blamed for a default.

It's an alphabet.~~\n\nSecond, here's a brief history of immigration laws in the US. It's pretty fucked up.\n\nOkay, so there is some historical precedence for excluding immigrants from immigrating to the US. Particularly those of Asian descent. \"Congress passed the infamous Chinese exclusion laws barring virtually all immigration of persons of Chinese ancestry and severely punishing Chinese immigrants who violated the harsh laws.\" ([source](http://academic.udayton.edu/race/02rights/immigr09.htm))\n\n&gt;The Supreme Court emphasized national sovereignty as the rationale for not disturbing the laws excluding the \"obnoxious Chinese\" from the United States. In the famous Chinese Exclusion Case, the Supreme Court stated that \"[t]he power of exclusion of foreigners [is] an incident of sovereignty belonging to the government of the United States, as a part of [[[its] sovereign powers delegated by the Constitution.\" \n\n&gt;Similarly, in Fong Yue Ting v. United States, the Court reasoned that **\"[t]he right of a nation to expel or deport foreigners ... is as absolute and unqualified as the right to prohibit and prevent their entrance into the country.\"** (*ibid.*)\n\nIn 1924, these laws were expanded to create a quota system by which \"It initially permitted annual immigration of up to two percent of the number of foreign-born persons of a particular nationality in the United States as set forth in the 1890 census.\" (*ibid.*)\n\nIn conjunction with this quota system, a literacy test was instituted. This test essentially said \"You have to speak english, hebrew, yiddish or another dialect to immigrate.\"\n\nIn 1962, the quota system was revised into the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) that remains in place until 1965.\n\nThe INA was replaced by the INA of 1965, also known as the Hart-Cellar Act. This act focused on family ties in the US as well as skills. However, numerical restrictions remained:\n\n&gt;Numerical restrictions on visas were set at 170,000 per year, with a per-country-of-origin quota, not including immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, nor \"special immigrants\" (including those born in \"independent\" nations in the Western Hemisphere, former citizens, ministers, and employees of the U.S. government abroad). ([wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965))\n\nThese quotas were extended to 700,000 per year in 1990.\n\nSo, to answer your question, yes, it is with precedence and SCOTUS endorsement possible to restrict immigration to the United States by nationality. This could probably be extended to religious grounds, but I think it would be challenged up to the SCOTUS again. \n\nI think it would come down to a split decision (5-4) that could go either way. It's a national sovereignty issue vs. restrictions on religion. In my opinion, I don't think that such a law, as proposed, would violate the Constitution's first amendment protections of \"an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\" because they aren't denying the religious rights of citizens to practice. They are preventing certain people from immigrating.\n\nThat said, is it a good idea? Hell no. I think the court of (global) public opinion would be strongly opposed to such an idea, even if certain vocal minorities in the US would support it.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;First of all, people write in cyrillic, not speak.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Okay, let's look at what the poli-sci literature says. I'm mostly pulling this from a literature review by Thomas Stratmann published in 2005, I'll use his citations.\n\nStratmann notes that you can't exactly draw direct correlations between contributions and votes because contributions are biased toward those they support. For example, the NRA likes gun supporters, so they will contribute to those campaigns more than they will to those in support of gun control. \n\n&gt;**Recent research shows that campaign contributions have not had much of an effect on legislative voting behavior**, as summarized by popular voting indexes, such as those produced by the AFL-CIO\u2019s Congress on Political Equality (COPE), the liberal Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), and the defense-industry oriented National Security Council (NSC).\n\nIn some instances, organizations will donate to both sides of a campaign. From memory, I think that many commercial financial institutions donated to both Obama and Romney in 2012, but donated more to Romney.\n\nOne might argue that retiring legislators would be more likely to accept financial contributions to help their post-legislative spending.\n&gt;Lott (1997) examine whether retiring legislators, who are not threatened by retaliation in the next election cycle, change their voting behavior, measured as a change in voting score, when there is a change in contributions from relevant PACs. **They find only modest evidence that changes in these contributions change voting behavior.**\n\nA third set of major lobbying groups are corporate and labor organizations.\n&gt;Ansolabehere, de Figuieredo and Snyder (2003) examine the effect of labor and corporate contributions on voting scores assigned by the US Chamber of Commerce and likewise **find no evidence that contributions affect voting in the predicted directions once one allows for member or district fixed effects, or uses instrumental variables estimation.**\n\nOkay, so let's look at repeated votes: routine votes that come up frequently. If the underlying constituency doesn't change, we can examine contributions between the votes, and how the subsequent votes changed. Stratmann (2002) specifically looked at the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, first attempted in 1991 (failed) and then in 1998 (passed).\n&gt;He finds that these contribution changes **have a statistically significant effect on a representative\u2019s voting decision.** In particular, Stratmann finds that **an extra $10,000 in banking contributions increases the likelihood of a House member voting in favor of repeal by approximately eight percentage points.** Stratmann also finds that the influence of campaign contributions on voting decisions was larger for junior members of the House than for their more senior colleagues.\n\nOkay, so we can see that non-election cycle contributions are more likely to positively impact legislation. That's our first positive correlation.\n\nHow about roll call votes?\n&gt;Ansolabehere, de Figuieredo and Snyder (2003) surveyed articles in the economics and political science literatures that estimated the effects of cam- paign contributions on roll call votes. **Of the nearly 40 articles surveyed, they find that the estimated contribution coefficients are either statistically insignificant or have the wrong sign in roughly 75% of the cases.**\n\nStratmann (2005) goes on to do a meta analysis of all of the studies (n = 256) he references.\n&gt;This meta-analysis reverses the finding reported in existing studies that campaign contributions have no effect on legislative voting behavior. The meta-analysis performed here suggests that money does indeed influence votes. However, one needs to be careful in not overstating this result.\n\nHe couches this statement by saying that to accept his meta-analysis, you have to assume that all of the studies that he used have \"properly controlled for the potential simultaneous determination of contributions and votes.\"\n\nPersonally, I'm unlikely to agree with his meta-analysis based on past research I've done in the area. You draw your own conclusions, but of the approximately 256 studies that Stratmann (2005) referenced, only **one** found a **significant** positive correlation between contributions and votes.\n\nedit: clarity", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Mitch_Deadberg", "id": "t1_c9kwqbe", "parent_id": "t3_1cwvnh", "score": 11, "retrieved_on": 1431458697, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1366726644, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1cwvnh", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9kwqbe", "author_flair_text": "[IPE | EU | Finance][Moderate]", "created_utc": "1366722312", "distinguished": null, "ups": 11}

There's nothing else in our system, just apples and dollars. \n\nSay there's a famine and the government needs to buy more apples than they normally do. They can print more money, lets say another $10, but that doesn't mean there are more apples. Economics would tell us the price of apples should rise to $2 apiece. Thus, your savings account has devalued or depreciated; you can buy fewer apples with the same amount of money. The price of goods has **inflated**. \n\nIn a real economy, there are millions of goods and services to buy, but it's still a finite number. Printing more dollars devalues that currency and creates inflation. Americans can buy fewer goods and services with their money. While the Federal Reserve is printing a lot of money (~$80 billion, with a B, per month) inflation is historically low, if not nonexistent. \n\nAnd that's the Fed's job: controlling the money supply (number of dollars in the system) high enough to encourage job growth while keeping it low enough to prevent high inflation.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bx68k", "selftext": "Ok, thanks for the answer.

Obviously this means that there could be a warehouse full of apples nearby, but if you don't have any money...\n\nSo, a lot of food ends up rotting instead of being eaten, especially when austerity kicks in.  This is a problem not just with food, but as production becomes more and more automated, we're heading for the \"Google economy\" where lots of stuff is free, but no one has a job.  Look at Wikipedia, it's great.  But obviously it means nobody at Encyclopedia Brittanica has a job anymore.  I think we're seeing this on a large scale if you look at old shows like *Seinfeld* where people like Elaine work in publishing jobs which have since been replaced by the Internet and computers.  Look at old shows and you see legions of people sitting around doing jobs that don't need to be done anymore.\n\nWe're fast approaching the point where people don't *need* to be working 40 hours a week, but we still require them to.  Only now, they have to work in \"service sector\" jobs, which basically means two part-time jobs with no health care and no empowerment, while all of the profits go to the top.\n\n**********************************\n\nThe other thing is, and I could be wrong about this too, but you said inflation would devalue my savings.  But, most Americans don't *have* any savings.  They have debt.\n\nI'll put it another way.  If you took out a mortgage in 1970 for $30,000, that's a lot of money at first and you probably struggled to make your payments.  But, by the time 1990 rolled around, that same $30,000 mortgage is a joke.  You might as well pay off the remaining balance with loose change you find in your couch cushions.\n\nWell, I've got a $200,000 mortgage, so you can see why I'd be OK with some inflation if it means my income goes up.  My debt is fixed, it won't go up with inflation, but hopefully my income would.  Also, I think we owe it to seniors to give them some kind of stipend to live on to keep them out of poverty, as well as get them out of the work force so younger people can have those jobs.\n\nOf course, the people that make policy decisions tend to be the same people who hold my mortgage.

An examination of laws passed by percent of total legislation shows us that the 112th Congress was the least productive again (2.3091%) followed by the 111th (2.8137%) and the 110th (3.2901%).\n\nSome really basic statistics will show us that the 112th Congress was 246.29 Enacted Laws below the population's mean (ie, the 17 observed Congresses taken as a whole population), placing it 1.74 standard deviations away from the mean. When compared to the average *total* pieces of legislation, we see that the 112th exceeded the average number of total pieces of legislation by 589.71 and an SD of 0.35.\n\nFrom that we can see that, if the 112th had been functioning on average, then they *should* have passed more bills than average. Specifically, they should have passed 561.99 bills.\n\nNow, let's look to your point on bills passing one chamber but failing the other.\n\nSince the 96th Congress (Jan 15, 1979 to Dec 16, 1980), a total of 285,984 bills have been filed. Of those bills, [342 bills](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?congress=112&amp;status=28,29#current_status=12&amp;current_status=13&amp;current_status=16&amp;current_status=17&amp;current_status=19&amp;current_status=20)^1 have failed a vote. That's an astonishingly low 0.1196% failure rate. Most fail in suspension (basically when trying to rush a bunch legislation through at once, common house keeping stuff) or in cloture (ie a filibuster).\n\nOf those 342 bills, 131 have failed a specific chamber vote, or about 0.045% of the total bills. Specifically, 98 bills have come to a vote and failed in the House, 33 bills have failed in the Senate. And of those, only **5** have passed one chamber but failed the other total.\n\nOnly one of those bills that passed one chamber and failed the other happened recently: [Senate Concurrent Resolution 56](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/sconres56). Largely an inconsequential piece of legislation, I think it was an effort to prevent the House from doing something weird with their operations, but I don't exactly remember and can't find any commentary on the resolution.\n\n^1 Due to a website quirk, make sure you change the Congress to All on the right side", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_19fqla", "selftext": "How many bills or what not have failed to come to a vote.

An examination of laws passed by percent of total legislation shows us that the 112th Congress was the least productive again (2.3091%) followed by the 111th (2.8137%) and the 110th (3.2901%).\n\nSome really basic statistics will show us that the 112th Congress was 246.29 Enacted Laws below the population's mean (ie, the 17 observed Congresses taken as a whole population), placing it 1.74 standard deviations away from the mean. When compared to the average *total* pieces of legislation, we see that the 112th exceeded the average number of total pieces of legislation by 589.71 and an SD of 0.35.\n\nFrom that we can see that, if the 112th had been functioning on average, then they *should* have passed more bills than average. Specifically, they should have passed 561.99 bills.\n\nNow, let's look to your point on bills passing one chamber but failing the other.\n\nSince the 96th Congress (Jan 15, 1979 to Dec 16, 1980), a total of 285,984 bills have been filed. Of those bills, [342 bills](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?congress=112&amp;status=28,29#current_status=12&amp;current_status=13&amp;current_status=16&amp;current_status=17&amp;current_status=19&amp;current_status=20)^1 have failed a vote. That's an astonishingly low 0.1196% failure rate. Most fail in suspension (basically when trying to rush a bunch legislation through at once, common house keeping stuff) or in cloture (ie a filibuster).\n\nOf those 342 bills, 131 have failed a specific chamber vote, or about 0.045% of the total bills. Specifically, 98 bills have come to a vote and failed in the House, 33 bills have failed in the Senate. And of those, only **5** have passed one chamber but failed the other total.\n\nOnly one of those bills that passed one chamber and failed the other happened recently: [Senate Concurrent Resolution 56](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/sconres56). Largely an inconsequential piece of legislation, I think it was an effort to prevent the House from doing something weird with their operations, but I don't exactly remember and can't find any commentary on the resolution.\n\n^1 Due to a website quirk, make sure you change the Congress to All on the right side", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_19fqla", "selftext": "How many bills or what not have failed to come to a vote.

An examination of laws passed by percent of total legislation shows us that the 112th Congress was the least productive again (2.3091%) followed by the 111th (2.8137%) and the 110th (3.2901%).\n\nSome really basic statistics will show us that the 112th Congress was 246.29 Enacted Laws below the population's mean (ie, the 17 observed Congresses taken as a whole population), placing it 1.74 standard deviations away from the mean. When compared to the average *total* pieces of legislation, we see that the 112th exceeded the average number of total pieces of legislation by 589.71 and an SD of 0.35.\n\nFrom that we can see that, if the 112th had been functioning on average, then they *should* have passed more bills than average. Specifically, they should have passed 561.99 bills.\n\nNow, let's look to your point on bills passing one chamber but failing the other.\n\nSince the 96th Congress (Jan 15, 1979 to Dec 16, 1980), a total of 285,984 bills have been filed. Of those bills, [342 bills](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?congress=112&amp;status=28,29#current_status=12&amp;current_status=13&amp;current_status=16&amp;current_status=17&amp;current_status=19&amp;current_status=20)^1 have failed a vote. That's an astonishingly low 0.1196% failure rate. Most fail in suspension (basically when trying to rush a bunch legislation through at once, common house keeping stuff) or in cloture (ie a filibuster).\n\nOf those 342 bills, 131 have failed a specific chamber vote, or about 0.045% of the total bills. Specifically, 98 bills have come to a vote and failed in the House, 33 bills have failed in the Senate. And of those, only **5** have passed one chamber but failed the other total.\n\nOnly one of those bills that passed one chamber and failed the other happened recently: [Senate Concurrent Resolution 56](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/sconres56). Largely an inconsequential piece of legislation, I think it was an effort to prevent the House from doing something weird with their operations, but I don't exactly remember and can't find any commentary on the resolution.\n\n^1 Due to a website quirk, make sure you change the Congress to All on the right side", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_19fqla", "selftext": "How many bills or what not have failed to come to a vote.

His tax is 6.2% on his income or $124 per month.  He starts working at 25 and retires at 65 (again, for easy math).  He's going to die at 85 (above the life expectancy).  I'm going to round down interest to 2 decimals, just as a bank might.\n\nOver the course of his working life, he contributes $59,520 into the fund.  Now we just need to work out the interest rate that he could have gotten.\n\nLets start with 2%.  In this case, he would have $91,066 compounded monthly.  Not really a bad haul.  To \"withdraw\" all that cash within the next 20 years, assuming the same return on investment, he needs $460.69 per month.  Right now the [benefits at $1,230 per month](http://ssa-custhelp.ssa.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/13/~/average-monthly-social-security-benefit-for-a-retired-worker).  At 2%, its a good investment.  But that's less than the market has returned in [the last five years](http://observationsandnotes.blogspot.com/2009/03/average-annual-stock-market-return.html)\n\nWell, for Pete, what's the breakeven point where he would be better off having his own account?  4.96%.  You can look at that second link and see how that compares.\n\nLets go back to the 2%, but instead change his income to the 2013 limit - [$113,700](http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/quickfacts/prog_highlights/index.html).  What does this man need to get at 2% each month?  $2,182.59.  Obviously that won't happen.  So what's his break even interest rate?  0.15%.

I'm going to round down interest to 2 decimals, just as a bank might.\n\nOver the course of his working life, he contributes $59,520 into the fund.  Now we just need to work out the interest rate that he could have gotten.\n\nLets start with 2%.  In this case, he would have $91,066 compounded monthly.  Not really a bad haul.  To \"withdraw\" all that cash within the next 20 years, assuming the same return on investment, he needs $460.69 per month.  Right now the [benefits at $1,230 per month](http://ssa-custhelp.ssa.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/13/~/average-monthly-social-security-benefit-for-a-retired-worker).  At 2%, its a good investment.  But that's less than the market has returned in [the last five years](http://observationsandnotes.blogspot.com/2009/03/average-annual-stock-market-return.html)\n\nWell, for Pete, what's the breakeven point where he would be better off having his own account?  4.96%.  You can look at that second link and see how that compares.\n\nLets go back to the 2%, but instead change his income to the 2013 limit - [$113,700](http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/quickfacts/prog_highlights/index.html).  What does this man need to get at 2% each month?  $2,182.59.  Obviously that won't happen.  So what's his break even interest rate?  0.15%.  Basically nothing - he could bury the money in his backyard and take it out evenly over 20 years and not be much better off than SS.  Heck, investing over the last five years would have been better, including the crash.\n\nNow, remember this is assuming you're only working from 25 to 65 without getting a raise ever.  The reason I showed the guy at the maximum is that as your income increases, the break-even rate gets lower and lower.  Inflation pushes that rate even lower (its essentially a negative interest rate).  And notice that I wasn't including the tax on social security - roughly 85% is taxable.  That pushes the rate even lower.  I will spare you all the details, but for the average American making $24k annually (again, this is the median income for a family of four), the returns on Social Security are abysmal.\n\nThe only advantage that Social Security has over traditional investment/private investment is that its benefits are guaranteed - until Congress decides otherwise.", "id": "t1_c87rbsd", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "AuditorTux", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_17ouml", "selftext": "The return on the trust funds investments has historically been 5.5%, and in 2011 it earned 4.4%.

As others have mentioned, part of how European countries are able to provide such sweeping social services is based on their tax rates. The Tax Policy Center gives us [this incredibly hard to read series of tables](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=456) showing us that as of 2009, the average federal tax rate paid by all Americans is 17.4%, with a range from 1.0% (lowest quintile) to 28.9% (top 1%). Let's compare that with Sweden \u2013 a bastion of social services. According to the [OECD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oecd), Sweden's marginal tax rate was the highest in Europe, [with a marginal rate of 56.6%.](http://www.thelocal.se/43584/20121003/#.UQqK_Ep2FFA)\n2. Consumption Based Tax systems \u2013 AKA a \"Flat Tax\" \u2013 are [essentially Value Added Taxes (VATs) like you see in the United Kingdom.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/leonardburman/2011/10/24/what-is-a-flat-tax-surprise-it-is-a-vat/). While flat taxes are favored by conservatives \u2013 and note that Forbes is a [conservative leaning publication](http://libguides.sou.edu/content.php?pid=54475&amp;sid=678227) that agrees with me \u2013 they are considered to be a regressive tax that disproportionately affects lower income brackets. Yes, we're all paying 15% equally, but you have to consider the percent of income that a single mother who makes $19,000 a year dedicates to sustenance compared to a CEO who makes $10m a year. (Hint: the mother uses 100% of her income to sustain her family; the CEO is significantly less than that.)\n3. Yes, the US spends a lot on the military. Per [this 2011 Economist article](http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/06/military-spending), the US spends more than the next 17 countries *combined*. But, let's compare Apples to Apples here. [Here is a graph of Military Spending per GDP as a percent](http://i.imgur.com/mo62dYP.png). The data comes from the [World Bank Databank](http://databank.worldbank.org). As we can see, the US (in that solid, royal blue line across the top) does not exceptionally exceed the the rest of the top 17 countries.^1 As of 2010, the World Average (solid, white line) is 2.85% of National GDP, compared to the United States' 4.83% (a 169% difference). However, we do see a departure from the global trend (solid, green line) around 2001 \u2013 when the US entered Afghanistan.^2 Side bar: As I was researching part 4, I found the US's numbers for Military Spending : GDP for 2011 to 2022 (proj.) [here](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/tables.pdf). (PDF. Page 212) Currently, the US is spending 5.6% of its GDP on Defense, with a projection of reducing that to 3.4% by 2022 \u2013 with an average of 3.9% over that time. \n4. So, the US doesn't spend *that* much more than the rest of the world on military relative to GDP, but how about compared to its budget? Looking at the White House's proposed 2013 budget^3 [here](http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Overview) we can find the adjusted baseline outlays by category from 2011 to 2022 (page 212, Table S-4). [Here is that data in chart form.](http://i.imgur.com/k5ZoMEC.png) The large green section is \"Total Outlays\" (basically, everything the US government pays for) and the blue section is \"appropriated discretionary defense spending.\"^4 The 2011 projection^5 for those outlays is 19.4% of the total budget. These outlays trend downward over the projected timeline until 13.54% in 2022 (average: 15.87%). There are some other outlays that aren't included in that baseline, but it's hard to get concrete numbers on that. If you do some research on this on your own, you'll find numbers as high as [25%](http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/federal_budget_detail_fy12bs12016n) in some instances. The discrepancy lies in the way that projections and baselines are measured. I'm using the official White House numbers; while they are accurate, *the measures may be biased to present what the White House wants to portray*, but it's the least biased source I could find.  \n5. Okay, so the US spends on average a little bit more on military as a percentage of GDP than the top ~~18~~ 17 spenders and defense spending currently accounts for about a fifth of the Federal budget. How does that compare to the historical US record? [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/V69V8Dp.png) a chart I grabbed from a 2011 Webcast put on by an investment bank. The source they list is the [Office of Management and Budget](http://www.OMB.gov). As we can see, the amount of money spent on defense has risen astronomically \u2013 mostly attributed in the 2000's to two wars in the Middle East \u2013 but as a percentage of the overall budget, it has trended downward since 1986. Sidebar: Snap the US spent *a lot* as a percent of GDP in WWII.  \n6. Okay, this is getting long. I'll wrap it up.  \n7. The US has a **massive** global military presence. That's where most of that money goes. The argument that supports this presence is that of [Global Hegemony.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemony) \"[America's Global Advantage: US Hegemony and International Cooperation](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/66590/carla-norrlof/americas-global-advantage-us-hegemony-and-international-cooperat)\" is a really good book on the idea of America's hegemony. I have a digital copy of the book if you're interested in reading it. Here's a quote from the abstract:\n\n&gt;Drawing on \"hegemonic stability theory,\" which was developed by Charles Kindleberger, Robert Gilpin, and others in the 1970s and 1980s, Norrlof argues that the United States has incentives to use its dominant position to organize and maintain an open economic system, providing security and access to markets for other states while enjoying a steady stream of economic benefits for itself. With the special role of the dollar, the United States has been able to externalize the costs of macroeconomic adjustment, and its global military presence reinforces the perceived stability of the dollar and the U.S. market. Thanks to the mutually reinforcing logics of trade, money, and security, Norrlof argues, even a gradual decline in the United States' global market share would not undermine its primacy.\n\n8 . The basic argument is that if the US *didn't* have such a massive military presence, it wouldn't be able to perform as well on a global scale. A lot of benefits come from being in the biggest kid in the room \u2013 it's just expensive to maintain.\n\n^1 \u2013 Please note that I excepted Saudi Arabia from the Military:GDP chart because its outlying data skewed the chart, and the average. Its military spending to GDP is consistently between 8.47% and 12.47% \u2013 resting at 10.04% as of 2010.  \n^2 \u2013 Note that the US's military spending is nearing its 12 year high that was set in 1992 \u2013 also when the US was involved in a military operation in Iraq. ([Desert Storm.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_storm))  \n^3 \u2013 Note that the US Congress hasn't passed a budget since 2011.  \n^4 \u2013 Appropriated discretionary defense spending means money that is assigned and authorized (appropriated) by Congress for certain things  that is not mandated on a multi-year basis by existing legislation, and thus must be determined anew in each year's budget. ([Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expenditures_in_the_United_States_federal_budget#Discretionary_spending))\n^5 \u2013 It's a \"projection\" because Congress hasn't officially passed a budget, so it can't be official.

As for creating a public web site to access candidate advertising, who pays for the website? The design? The hosting? The traffic? Who maintains and updates it for every candidate? [This study](http://www.census.gov/prod/2/gov/gc/gc92_1_2.pdf) (PDF) from the 1992 Census found that there were about 513,000 elected officials. We can only assume that has grown. Now you have to expand that to each candidate for each position. An extremely conservative estimate of 2 candidates per position means well over a million profiles to be maintained. Not to mention the overall decreased access. Here we see that [96.7% of Americans own a TV](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/03/business/media/03television.html) compared to [this 2010 study](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2010/02/almost-a-third-of-americans-still-dont-use-the-net/) that showed over a third of all Americans *never use the Internet at all*.\n5.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Yeah, so hyperinflation is really rare in developed nations as you pointed out because there are tighter controls on spending, the nation's central bank has a better understanding of how to react to market shifts and there's less market risk.  \n\nZimbabwe's massive hyperinflation was mostly due to Mugabe's redistribution of land from white colonists to black native Zimbabweans. Because the farmers didn't have the skills necessary to farm the land, productive capacity vanished \u2013 essentially over night \u2013 and the supply of good similarly disappeared rapidly. Demand remained high for staple goods, but the nation's economy couldn't provide the supply. Mugabe then began to rapidly print new bills to help finance his involvement in the Second Congo War.

Last fall, the Federal Reserve raised their quantitative easing efforts for the second time, starting what's known as QE3 (quantitative easing, round 3). The Fed is buying up mortgage backed securities (those toxic assets that no one wants) to the tune of [$85B a month without a set end date.](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/8b54404c-55d2-11e2-9aa1-00144feab49a.html#axzz2ISrORrBq) Inflation is supposed to remain below 2.5 per cent. If the Fed continues to purchase securities at this rate through 2013, they'll accumulate *another* $1T in long-term assets. \n\nI don't think we can simply multiply that 2.5% by 16 to see where we'd be at if we eliminated the debt through some federal government action. Honestly, it's a good question. I'd have to look into the inflation impact on a long timeline.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "So, we're making a massive assumption about how this debt is paid off. \n\nFirst, here's where the US national debt is as of yesterday: [$16,432,631,489,854.70](https://twitter.com/nationaldebt)\n\nThere are a few options:\n\n1. The Treasury Department prints off 16,432,631,489,854.70 new dollars. This isn't reasonable because, as /u/thethets mentioned, hyper-inflation sets in and no one can afford to operate in the world economy. A loaf of bread quickly comes to cost millions of dollars. There are some fascinating stories of hyper-inflation in history that I can go through if you'd like.\n2. The US raises taxes to 108% of the [2011 GDP](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp) of 15,094.0 billion USD. In essence, the federal government would have to take **all** of the value created in the US economy (in imports, exports, transfer payments, domestic investment [ie real estate and other capital intensive purchases like heavy machinery]). Obviously, this isn't reasonable. Our current tax system accounts for [~25%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_revenue_as_percentage_of_GDP) of the US Gross Domestic Product.\n3. Some magnanimous multibillionaires donate all of their money to paying off the national debt. \"The combined net worth of the 2012 class of the 400 richest Americans is [$1.7 trillion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_members_of_the_Forbes_400)\". If we expand to the whole world, that number only jumps to [$4.6 trillion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes_list_of_billionaires).\n4. Let's say the entire world decides to chip in to help us pay off our debts because it's our birthday or whatever. Global GDP is [$69,110B](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_world_product). So, with a ~23.8% tax rate levied across the entire planet, we're able to pay off the national debt tomorrow. \n\nSetting aside how reasonable of an action that is, let's look at some of the possible outcomes.\n\n1. Large portions of the global economy are based on US Treasury Bonds. If you have a retirement account, pension fund or anything like, part of your money is probably invested in US t-bonds. You invested in those t-bonds because you knew that you would be able to get that money in 30 years when you want to retire at exactly the amount you are owed. But since the US is paying early, you're actually getting **less** than you expected because you aren't accruing the interest you expected. On the flip side, you have your principal back, and some interest, available well before you were expecting it.\n2. While that NPR story posted below would have you believe that *THE ENTIRE WORLD ECONOMY IS BASESD ON TREASURY BONDS* (dun dun dunnnnn! Ominous music and lightning in the background!) and the whole world economy would implode... that's simply not the case.  \n3. So, most US contracts use the Prime Lending Rate to determine your interest rate. Basically, your interest rate on everything from car loans to mortgages to credit cards is the Prime Rate plus some other premiums (like default risk, inflation, etc). In turn, the Prime Rate is based on the [Federal Funds Rate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate). Basically, that's the rate that banks borrow from each other. The Fed funds rate is determined (read: influenced) by the Federal Reserve.  \nIn the past ten years, the Fed has [wildly changed the federal funds rate](http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/statistics/dlyrates/fedrate.html) (2003: 1%; 2006: 5.25%; 2012: 0.00% to 0.25%), so almost every debt contract written in the past ten years has had a provision to switch the base rate formula. For the most part, these contracts use the London Interbank Offered Rate (or [LIBOR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libor)). So, if the Treasury stopped offering bonds and bills \u2013 and the Prime Rate disappeared \u2013 all of these contracts could easily convert to the LIBOR (or [TIBOR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIBOR) or [SIBOR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIBOR) etc.)\n4. So what happens in the markets? It's an interesting prospect to say the least. Now we have $16T of free capital that was once tied up in \"risk free securities\". Where does that money go? For the most part, it would probably be reinvested into other \"risk free\" securities \u2013 so, other established Western (culturally, economically) countries like Germany, the UK, maybe France.\n5. There might also be an increase in investors into the stock market. We'd see significant gains across all indices (S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, NASDAQ, etc.) as large portions of this new money floods into public securities.\n6. Because we gained this money from levying a 24% tax on the world, we'd probably see a massive depression roll across the globe which might put downward pressure on the stock markets \u2013 but that's purely hypothetical.\n\nI think your other questions have been answered correctly, and well, by /u/succulentcrepes and /u/adamshell in regards to which businesses, countries and industries would be affected by this influx of capital. The big thing to remember is that countries, businesses, capital funds, etc all use treasury bonds and treasury bills as a way to safely \"store\" their money in a \"risk free\" manner. There's no risk that the US will ever default against its debt obligations. In fact, the Constitution says we can't: \n\n&gt;AMENDMENT XIV Section 4: The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned.\n\nLet me know if you have any follow up questions.

Because the farmers didn't have the skills necessary to farm the land, productive capacity vanished \u2013 essentially over night \u2013 and the supply of good similarly disappeared rapidly. Demand remained high for staple goods, but the nation's economy couldn't provide the supply. Mugabe then began to rapidly print new bills to help finance his involvement in the Second Congo War. As the new bills flooded the marketplace, inflation took over on a scale never seen before.  \n\nRestrictions and controls on the US government \u2013 and of most western governments \u2013 are too strong to allow for hyperinflation to develop like that without something ridiculous happening.\n\nAs to your question about spreading it out over several years... Let's look at a real world example. I'm sure you've heard of [\"Quantitative Easing\"](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2010/10/07/130408926/quantitative-easing-explained). Last fall, the Federal Reserve raised their quantitative easing efforts for the second time, starting what's known as QE3 (quantitative easing, round 3). The Fed is buying up mortgage backed securities (those toxic assets that no one wants) to the tune of [$85B a month without a set end date.](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/8b54404c-55d2-11e2-9aa1-00144feab49a.html#axzz2ISrORrBq) Inflation is supposed to remain below 2.5 per cent. If the Fed continues to purchase securities at this rate through 2013, they'll accumulate *another* $1T in long-term assets. \n\nI don't think we can simply multiply that 2.5% by 16 to see where we'd be at if we eliminated the debt through some federal government action. Honestly, it's a good question. I'd have to look into the inflation impact on a long timeline.

From the founding of the United States until 1917, Congress directly authorized each individual debt issuance separately. In order to provide more flexibility to finance the United States' involvement in World War I, Congress modified the method by which it authorizes debt in the Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917.[57] Under this act Congress established an aggregate limit, or \"ceiling,\" on the total amount of bonds that could be issued.\n\nBasically, the idea is to give Congress a lump sum of money they can borrow for a period of time, rather than making them pass legislation for each individual borrowing. \n\nIt was originally enacted to ease the process of borrowing.

Congress, which has the sole power to borrow money, has delegated that power to the Executive Branch for efficiency purposes.  The Debt Ceiling is a scope limitation on that delegation.  \n\nTheoretically, I can see some usefulness in a debt ceiling independent from the annual appropriations process, in that it forces Congress to re-assess its priorities from time to time as the Nation's debt level rises.  The Founders gave the borrowing power to Congress because they thought borrowing on the country's credit was Big Deal, and wanted it to be in the hands of the folks who faced the voters most frequently.  To the extent that the Congress and the public lose sight of the long-term debt in passing annual spending bills, this forces them to confront the issue every once in a while.  \n\nThat said, the best way to understand the current situation is that it is a situation where the Administration needs the cooperation of the party currently out-of-power, which the party currently out-of-power doesn't see a good reason to give away for free.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;i'd say that the contribution to world peace of nuclear weapons is undeniably, highly successful\n\nI've been searching for a paper I read when I was doing my initial global political economy studies, and unfortunately i can't find the exact one I'm looking for. I'll go off of memory, and then provide a couple of other similar studies to look at.\n\nIn general, the presence of nuclear weapons tend to *destabilize* global relations. The graph looks something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/6XGmA.png). With only one nuclear state, there is almost a guarantee of a nuclear war; nuclear hegemony allows the sole nuclear state to act unilaterally without the possibility of symmetric retaliation. For historical proof, one need only to look at WWII. The US was able to use nuclear weapons in the final throes of its Japanese assault because it had no fear of repercussion. Japan couldn't nuke them back, nor could any other actor retaliate.\n\nIn a two-nuclear state world, we see the possibility of nuclear war decrease significantly. While it's still a present threat, both states are unlikely to engage in nuclear war against each other, or non-nuclear states for fear of reprisal from the other nuclear state. \n\nIn a 1981 [paper](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/waltz1.htm) on the spread of nuclear weapons, Kenneth Waltz discusses the progression of warfare throughout the centuries. In the past, large conglomerations of kingdoms and nation-states would band together with largely homogenous forces (think: knights, archers, catapults, etc). It was possible to miscalculate your opponents, or even your own, military presence because you are forced to depend on the fealty of other kingdoms and nation-states. \n\nHowever, with the advent of nuclear weapons, and at the height of the cold war, Waltz notes that 90% of the Warsaw Pact's military spending was made by the USSR; 60% of NATO's military spending was by the US. No longer did the US or the USSR need to rely on allies to execute a war: they had a larger force than their respective allies *combined*. Waltz: \n&gt;\"In a bipolar world, uncertainty lessens and calculations are easier to make. The military might of both great powers makes quick and easy conquest impossible for either, and this is clearly seen. To respond rapidly to fine changes in the mili\u00adtary balance is at once less important and more easily done.\" Waltz goes on to describe military actions on a global scale in a bipolar world: \"In the great-power politics of a bipolar world, who is a danger to whom is never in doubt. **Moreover, with only two powers capa\u00adble of acting on a world scale, anything that happens anywhere is potentially of concern to both of them.**\" (emphasis added) \n\nHad the USSR possessed nuclear weapons contemporaneously with the US, would Truman have been as likely to bomb Hiroshima and Nagaski? What if Emperor Hirohito had access to nuclear weapons and the capability to retaliate against the US mainland?\n\nAs the number of nuclear states increase, the relative strengths of the newly nuclear states becomes more symmetrical to those that led the bipolar world. \n\n&gt;\"With three or more powers, flexibility of alliances keeps relations of friendship and enmity fluid and makes everyone's estimate of the present and future relation of forces uncertain. ... Because who is a danger to whom is often unclear, the incentive to regard all dis\u00adequilibrating changes with concern and res\u00adpond to them with whatever effort may be required is weakened. To respond rapidly to fine changes is at once more difficult, because of blurred responsibilities, and more impor\u00adtant, because states live on narrow margins. Interdependence of parties, diffusion of dan\u00adgers, confusion of responses: These are the characteristics of great-power politics in a multi polar world.\"\n\nWaltz argues in 1981 that the spread of nuclear weapons won't create a multipolar world because there isn't a third state that can compete globally with the USSR and the US. \"The bipolar sys\u00adtem has lasted more than three decades because no third state has developed capabilities comparable to those of the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States produces about a quarter of the world's goods, and the Soviet Union about half as much. **Unless Europe unites, the United States will remain economically well ahead of other states.**\" (emphasis added). \n\nWhile Waltz comes to different conclusions \u2013 in the end, he thinks that proliferation isn't a threat because no other nation-state can achieve the level of nuclear force held by the USSR or the US \u2013 I think his conclusions are too dependent on the long-term sustainability of his bipolar state. The USSR collapsed a decade after he published his article. The Council on Foreign Relations discusses the potential for \"[loose nukes](http://www.cfr.org/weapons-of-terrorism/loose-nukes/p9549)\" \u2013 in short: the USSR had 27,000 nuclear weapons at its collapse; while Russia assures the world that they weapons are stored in a \"safe and reliable\" place, \"the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has reported more than a hundred nuclear smuggling incidents since 1993, eighteen of which involved highly enriched uranium, the key ingredient in an atomic bomb and the most dangerous product on the nuclear black market.\"\n\nWaltz never had to consider the threat of \"non-state actors\" (ie terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda) because in the 80s, the majority of global entities were state actors (sure, we can talk about the IRA from the 20s to the 60s, but that's regional.)\n\nWhat you're mainly talking about though, is what's called \"deterrence theory\". \n\n&gt;Different conceptions of rational deterrence theory assume that nuclear\nweapons have a deterrent effect at most levels of conflict. According to\ngeneral deterrence theory, a state should normally be deterred from starting war against a nuclear adversary because there is a possibility for the defender to launch a nuclear attack if its vital interests are severely affected (Morgan 1983; Ruth and Russett 1993).\n\n[Here](http://people.reed.edu/~ahm/Courses/Reed-POL-422-2012-S1_NP/Syllabus/EReadings/06.2/06.2.Paul1995Nuclear.pdf) is an interesting article on the (lack of) relevance of deterrence theory in regional conflicts between nuclear and non-nuclear states. In short, it doesn't work that way. Between 1945 and 1995, \"a total of 10 significant wars have occurred between nuclearstates and nonnuclear adversaries, 5 of which had been initiated by non-nuclear states.\" The threat of nuclear reprisal doesn't work because of what's known as the \"nuclear taboo\". \n\n&gt;It centers on the prohibitionary norm of nuclear taboo that all nuclear states have thus far observed. The argument here is that one of the key calculations, albeit an important one, of the nonnuclear state springs from the taboo, which is an unwritten international prohibition since the Hiroshima and Nagasaki attacks that nuclear weapons should not be used, especially against nonnuclear states.\n\nMoving on to your other comment:\n\n&gt;[Fiscal and monetary union] will not be successful because the people of europe simply do not want it.\n\nI disagree. Germans want it. As a supranational identity, I think Europeans want it. After all, economically the EU is far better off than it was pre-Union. The problem is that national \u2013 or sometimes regional \u2013 identity has superseded supranational identity. \n\nTake for example your average Parisian. The running joke is that they consider themselves a Parisian first, then a Frenchmen, then kind of a European. That provincial attitude runs counter to the EU's goal of shared culture and continental unity. It's not solely a Parisian attitude though, Barcelona, the Basque country and \u2013 sorry to say \u2013 Great Britain all act the same way. Self over country over Union. \n\nThe founders of the EU took steps to overcome that regional attitude, but its dissolution has been slow. A similar situation happened in the United States after the revolutionary war. (US history isn't my forte, so this'll be brief) The newly independent colonies formed themselves into a [Confederation of States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation) without much supranational authority. The interstate conflict eventually became too great and the Articles were replaced with the Constitution that formed a more cohesive Federalism with a superseded authority in the federal government.\n\nDo I think the European Union is a precursor to the United States of Europe? Maybe, but probably not. My point is that the EU is forging into unknown territory as the first supranational authority; growing pains are inevitable, revisions *will* be made and not everyone will like it at first. But eventually, I think a good system could come from sacrificing autonomy to a supranational authority.\n\nThe collective gains created by Union are too good to give up. Greece won't/can't leave, neither can Italy or Spain. But the current system is untenable, as we can clearly see. *Something* has to change.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_16k2u4", "selftext": "I think not. Think back to the origins of the European Union:\n\nThe European Coal and Steel Community [ECSC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Coal_and_Steel_Community) was founded in the 1950s on the tail of WWII \u2013 the second massively destructive war essentially fought between Germany and France (yeah, that's reductionist, I know) in 40 years. \n\nPioneered by France's Prime Minister Robert Schuman, the ECSC was designed to create economic union between France and Germany (as well as a few other European states) to inexorably tie their economies together. The theory was that with economic union, Germany wouldn't be tempted into another attempt at European domination and France would be more likely to step back from de Gaulle's hardline \"permanent occupation\" approach to Germany's WWII reparations.\n\nIf nothing else, you can look to the absolute lack of any major conflicts between European powers since 1952 and say that the foundation of the EU is undeniably, highly successful.  \n\nJumping to present day, I think the majority of your opposition stems from the impending collapse of the Eurozone economy \u2013 correct me if I'm wrong. On this point, I don't disagree with you at all. The Euro was a terrific idea: as an idea, it continued the ECSC's idea of unifying Europe's economy while furthering the broader European Community's (EC) interest in a culturally unified Europe. Financially, cross-border trade would become much simpler, as would the spread of European migration. Globally, the Eurozone created the [second largest economy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone#Comparison_table), barely below that of the United States.\n\nUnfortunately, the EU failed to tie fiscal and monetary policy together \u2013 as Germany had originally insisted. This created a situation where all of the economies were tied to each other's national legislative whims. For most, this meant being tied to a large, stable economy in Germany. Smaller nations, such as Greece, were able to sell bonds in euros that reflected rates of the broader Eurozone, not Greece's actual fiscal strategy.\n\nGreece, in particular, abused this situation to their own gain. Here's a great piece from This American Life describing a lot of the problems with Greece in particular. [link](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/455/continental-breakup) (~45m) The long story short from that podcast is that Greece lied to the EU for years about its debt to GDP ratio. \n\nAs these smaller countries abused the shared currency, but unshared fiscal policy, they racked up excessive debt that they would never have been approved to borrow had Germany's economy not been used to back their applications. When the United States' housing bubble crashed, so too did the global financial markets. This resulted in a global \"credit crunch\" \u2013 essentially, there wasn't an available cash to be loaned. Greece had been paying off old loans with new ones; once the credit crunch eliminated all available funds, they were unable to pay off their old loans. Thus, the looming spectre of default.\n\nIf the Eurozone let Greece (... and Spain and Ireland and Italy, let's not forget them) default on their bonds, that would destabilize the global market's perspective on Euro denominated bonds. \n\nGermany was reluctant to provide Greece with funds to avoid setting a precedent for the future (remember, Spain, Ireland and Italy are all on the edge of default as well.) But Germany also couldn't let any of those countries default without risking a national and international market destabilization. Hence the \"harsh\" austerity measures that have been enforced on Greece: essentially, stop spending so much money nationally, collect more taxes and *then* we'll give you the money to pay off your bonds.\n\nGreece can't leave the Eurozone simply there isn't a mechanism for such an exit. Further issues are a bit more complex. If Greece leaves the Eurozone to avoid paying its debts, what happens to all of the other bonds held by Eurozone countries? Would Spain leave as well? How about Italy? Would the Eurozone survive after the first piece is removed? Would we see the possibility of \"strategic defaults\" where Eurozone countries heavily indebt themselves and then exit the Eurozone? \n\nThat's a lot of uncertainty for the world's financial planners who despise the unknown. \n\nIs there a solution to this mess? Simply put: yes. Fiscal and monetary policy **must** be tied for this to be a successful union.

And while I understand that a lot of people can say that they opposed the Euro in hindsight (and to be clear, there were a lot of people who opposed it then) the idea of unifying Europe under one banner seemed like a great move in the early 2000s, when things were peachy.

Certainly possible with the whole continent unified, but likely impossible if it becomes (remains?) bitterly divided. \n\nI think that Greece would likely benefit from their own currency in the medium term.

I'll go off of memory, and then provide a couple of other similar studies to look at.\n\nIn general, the presence of nuclear weapons tend to *destabilize* global relations. The graph looks something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/6XGmA.png). With only one nuclear state, there is almost a guarantee of a nuclear war; nuclear hegemony allows the sole nuclear state to act unilaterally without the possibility of symmetric retaliation. For historical proof, one need only to look at WWII. The US was able to use nuclear weapons in the final throes of its Japanese assault because it had no fear of repercussion. Japan couldn't nuke them back, nor could any other actor retaliate.\n\nIn a two-nuclear state world, we see the possibility of nuclear war decrease significantly. While it's still a present threat, both states are unlikely to engage in nuclear war against each other, or non-nuclear states for fear of reprisal from the other nuclear state. \n\nIn a 1981 [paper](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/waltz1.htm) on the spread of nuclear weapons, Kenneth Waltz discusses the progression of warfare throughout the centuries. In the past, large conglomerations of kingdoms and nation-states would band together with largely homogenous forces (think: knights, archers, catapults, etc). It was possible to miscalculate your opponents, or even your own, military presence because you are forced to depend on the fealty of other kingdoms and nation-states. \n\nHowever, with the advent of nuclear weapons, and at the height of the cold war, Waltz notes that 90% of the Warsaw Pact's military spending was made by the USSR; 60% of NATO's military spending was by the US. No longer did the US or the USSR need to rely on allies to execute a war: they had a larger force than their respective allies *combined*. Waltz: \n&gt;\"In a bipolar world, uncertainty lessens and calculations are easier to make. The military might of both great powers makes quick and easy conquest impossible for either, and this is clearly seen. To respond rapidly to fine changes in the mili\u00adtary balance is at once less important and more easily done.\" Waltz goes on to describe military actions on a global scale in a bipolar world: \"In the great-power politics of a bipolar world, who is a danger to whom is never in doubt. **Moreover, with only two powers capa\u00adble of acting on a world scale, anything that happens anywhere is potentially of concern to both of them.**\" (emphasis added) \n\nHad the USSR possessed nuclear weapons contemporaneously with the US, would Truman have been as likely to bomb Hiroshima and Nagaski? What if Emperor Hirohito had access to nuclear weapons and the capability to retaliate against the US mainland?\n\nAs the number of nuclear states increase, the relative strengths of the newly nuclear states becomes more symmetrical to those that led the bipolar world. \n\n&gt;\"With three or more powers, flexibility of alliances keeps relations of friendship and enmity fluid and makes everyone's estimate of the present and future relation of forces uncertain. ... Because who is a danger to whom is often unclear, the incentive to regard all dis\u00adequilibrating changes with concern and res\u00adpond to them with whatever effort may be required is weakened. To respond rapidly to fine changes is at once more difficult, because of blurred responsibilities, and more impor\u00adtant, because states live on narrow margins. Interdependence of parties, diffusion of dan\u00adgers, confusion of responses: These are the characteristics of great-power politics in a multi polar world.\"\n\nWaltz argues in 1981 that the spread of nuclear weapons won't create a multipolar world because there isn't a third state that can compete globally with the USSR and the US. \"The bipolar sys\u00adtem has lasted more than three decades because no third state has developed capabilities comparable to those of the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States produces about a quarter of the world's goods, and the Soviet Union about half as much. **Unless Europe unites, the United States will remain economically well ahead of other states.**\" (emphasis added). \n\nWhile Waltz comes to different conclusions \u2013 in the end, he thinks that proliferation isn't a threat because no other nation-state can achieve the level of nuclear force held by the USSR or the US \u2013 I think his conclusions are too dependent on the long-term sustainability of his bipolar state. The USSR collapsed a decade after he published his article. The Council on Foreign Relations discusses the potential for \"[loose nukes](http://www.cfr.org/weapons-of-terrorism/loose-nukes/p9549)\" \u2013 in short: the USSR had 27,000 nuclear weapons at its collapse; while Russia assures the world that they weapons are stored in a \"safe and reliable\" place, \"the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has reported more than a hundred nuclear smuggling incidents since 1993, eighteen of which involved highly enriched uranium, the key ingredient in an atomic bomb and the most dangerous product on the nuclear black market.\"\n\nWaltz never had to consider the threat of \"non-state actors\" (ie terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda) because in the 80s, the majority of global entities were state actors (sure, we can talk about the IRA from the 20s to the 60s, but that's regional.)\n\nWhat you're mainly talking about though, is what's called \"deterrence theory\". \n\n&gt;Different conceptions of rational deterrence theory assume that nuclear\nweapons have a deterrent effect at most levels of conflict. According to\ngeneral deterrence theory, a state should normally be deterred from starting war against a nuclear adversary because there is a possibility for the defender to launch a nuclear attack if its vital interests are severely affected (Morgan 1983; Ruth and Russett 1993).\n\n[Here](http://people.reed.edu/~ahm/Courses/Reed-POL-422-2012-S1_NP/Syllabus/EReadings/06.2/06.2.Paul1995Nuclear.pdf) is an interesting article on the (lack of) relevance of deterrence theory in regional conflicts between nuclear and non-nuclear states. In short, it doesn't work that way. Between 1945 and 1995, \"a total of 10 significant wars have occurred between nuclearstates and nonnuclear adversaries, 5 of which had been initiated by non-nuclear states.\" The threat of nuclear reprisal doesn't work because of what's known as the \"nuclear taboo\". \n\n&gt;It centers on the prohibitionary norm of nuclear taboo that all nuclear states have thus far observed. The argument here is that one of the key calculations, albeit an important one, of the nonnuclear state springs from the taboo, which is an unwritten international prohibition since the Hiroshima and Nagasaki attacks that nuclear weapons should not be used, especially against nonnuclear states.\n\nMoving on to your other comment:\n\n&gt;[Fiscal and monetary union] will not be successful because the people of europe simply do not want it.\n\nI disagree. Germans want it. As a supranational identity, I think Europeans want it. After all, economically the EU is far better off than it was pre-Union. The problem is that national \u2013 or sometimes regional \u2013 identity has superseded supranational identity. \n\nTake for example your average Parisian. The running joke is that they consider themselves a Parisian first, then a Frenchmen, then kind of a European. That provincial attitude runs counter to the EU's goal of shared culture and continental unity. It's not solely a Parisian attitude though, Barcelona, the Basque country and \u2013 sorry to say \u2013 Great Britain all act the same way. Self over country over Union. \n\nThe founders of the EU took steps to overcome that regional attitude, but its dissolution has been slow. A similar situation happened in the United States after the revolutionary war. (US history isn't my forte, so this'll be brief) The newly independent colonies formed themselves into a [Confederation of States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation) without much supranational authority. The interstate conflict eventually became too great and the Articles were replaced with the Constitution that formed a more cohesive Federalism with a superseded authority in the federal government.\n\nDo I think the European Union is a precursor to the United States of Europe? Maybe, but probably not. My point is that the EU is forging into unknown territory as the first supranational authority; growing pains are inevitable, revisions *will* be made and not everyone will like it at first. But eventually, I think a good system could come from sacrificing autonomy to a supranational authority.\n\nThe collective gains created by Union are too good to give up. Greece won't/can't leave, neither can Italy or Spain. But the current system is untenable, as we can clearly see. *Something* has to change. The **best** answer, in my opinion, is fiscal and monetary union \u2013 but that's my global political economy and finance background talking.", "id": "t1_c7xe76g", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Mitch_Deadberg", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "excellent reply, thank you for the links. \n\nfrom the nuke paper: \n&gt;Indeed, the fear of nuclear weapons is more manifest among their possessors, indicating the operation of self-deterrence.\n\nvery, very interesting paper. i think the reluctance to initiate nuclear defense options needs to be explored more, but i am not sure we can totally discount it (as the data from the paper seems to indicate) because the overwhelming strength of the bipolar or unipolar dominated world political environment might not always be there forever. fear of backlash from the super powers probably plays a large part in having second and third tier nuclear powers holding their fire.\n\n&gt;I disagree.
