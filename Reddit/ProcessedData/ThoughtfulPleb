Two 25 year olds with no kids or a single parent with one kid making $16000 would pay $320. Two 30 year old adults with two kids making $24000 would pay about $480. These incomes are each just over the Federal poverty line for a family of that size, and each one is getting 98% of their premium subsidized.\n\nThe reason I say 'in principle' is that the subsidy comes in the form of a tax credit.

I did some examples using [the Kaiser Foundation's calculator](http://kff.org/interactive/subsidy-calculator/). I used Jackson, MS as my example, just because it was the first place in a non-subsidy state I could think of. One 21 year old making $12000 a year  should only be paying $240 a year out of pocket. Two 25 year olds with no kids or a single parent with one kid making $16000 would pay $320. Two 30 year old adults with two kids making $24000 would pay about $480. These incomes are each just over the Federal poverty line for a family of that size, and each one is getting 98% of their premium subsidized.\n\nThe reason I say 'in principle' is that the subsidy comes in the form of a tax credit. I'm not really sure how that works for people who would be paying so much less than that subsidy in taxes in the first place. The single person would pay about $200, the others would all pay nothing.

Because they have the opportunity to get insurance through their employer, they are not eligible to receive subsidies to purchase insurance through the exchanges. Congress tried to deal with this by allowing people to be eligible for subsidies in the exchanges if the insurance offered by their employer cost more than a certain percentage (I don't remember what the cut off is) of their income.

That's a libertarian philosophy, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nAnd people have the right to protect their property and community.  That's also a libertarian philosophy.  At the root of it is \"do no harm\".\n\nIf Zimmerman was just inching to shoot someone, as you claim, then he is in violation of that.  He should only be following to make sure the person isn't up to something.  There is *absolutely nothing wrong with that*.  But if he crosses that line, becoming a vigilante, then he's no longer \"doing no harm\".\n\nLikewise, if Martin reacted in stereotypical fashion when Zimmerman asked what he was doing \"None of your m-f-in' business creapy-ass cracker.  Go back and screw your sister you imbred piece of...\" then he's clearly also in violation of the \"do no harm\" principal (fighting words, really).  Or if he instead said nothing and just sucker punched the guy, wanting to prove his \"macho\" or something, he's in violation as well.\n\nWhat should have happened is this.\n* Martin walks through the neighborhood.\n* Zimmerman spots him, worried about the neighborhood, and follows him and asks what he is up to.\n* Martin simple replies \"Just walking home\"\n* Zimmerman nods and watches him as he leaves the neighborhood.\n* Both go back to their lives and nothing ever happens.\n\nSomewhere in there, someone got... wrong.  Macho came out, one of them was itching to prove a point or \"be a man\" and things spiraled out of control.\n\nBut they both made decisions to lead up to that point.  Whether they were using or not using a right isn't the issue - what we need to know is what actually started the physical confrontation that, according to Zimmerman, made him fear for his life and justify using the gun.  Zimmerman following Martin was not that start - it could have ended peacefully if both followed the \"do no harm\" rule.  Martin cutting through the neighborhood did not start that.  It was an insult, an act, or *something* that started those final events into play.\n\nThat's what we need to know.  All this BS about \"he profiled\" or stuff is beyond the point.  It doesn't matter if he profiled or not.  Heck, say Martin was the one who started the fight, wanting to prove he was a man and not going to take crap from Zimmerman... didn't he profile correctly then?\n\nAll of this is discussing how many angels can dance on the head of a needle.

The part they criticize is definition 1. (a person who has \"engaged in hostilities or who has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States\" or its allies). Perhaps the definition does leave *some* legal ambiguity, but the example the article gives is hyperbole. The idea that someone who has donated money to a charity for orphans in Afghanistan could be considered an enemy combatant is completely false, because that is not \"purposefully and materially supporting hositilites\". \n\nThe purpose of this definition is so that the US can designate individuals who are, say, building bombs, supplying ammunition, or substantially financing the Taliban as unlawful enemy combatants, since a more traditional definition would only include individuals who are actually engaging in combat. This is part of a larger, rather controversial debate on target viability in the war on terror, where non-state actors have become primary belligerents, and the line between militants and civilians in war zones has become much more blurred than it is in more traditional warfare.

I'm not sure how many straight marriages result in children, though I'd guess it's around 60%. There's also the fact that a homosexual couple will never unintentionally have a child. Marriage, in part, was set up to make sure that there was an established partnership in the case of unexpected pregnancies, at least back in the day when sex was (supposedly) reserved for marriage. I'm not sure how much weight that carries now that extra-marital sex is the norm, but there still might be something there. \n\nIn the end, you have to remember that it's not the court's job to make sure the laws are intelligent, just that they are valid under the constitution.

Not only do they have lower \"over head\" at the insurer level, it is significantly more efficient for providers who only need to deal with one (or very few) insurance providers instead of hundreds of different policies. This lowers the cost of healthcare in multiple ways. \n\nAdditionally, there is essentially zero competition in the health insurance market (in the US) today. This is mostly a result of our employer based health insurance system. Theoretically this should change next year with the insurance exchanges that were a part of ObamaCare.
