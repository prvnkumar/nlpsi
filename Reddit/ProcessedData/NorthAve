Perhaps the definition does leave *some* legal ambiguity, but the example the article gives is hyperbole. The idea that someone who has donated money to a charity for orphans in Afghanistan could be considered an enemy combatant is completely false, because that is not \"purposefully and materially supporting hositilites\". \n\nThe purpose of this definition is so that the US can designate individuals who are, say, building bombs, supplying ammunition, or substantially financing the Taliban as unlawful enemy combatants, since a more traditional definition would only include individuals who are actually engaging in combat. This is part of a larger, rather controversial debate on target viability in the war on terror, where non-state actors have become primary belligerents, and the line between militants and civilians in war zones has become much more blurred than it is in more traditional warfare.

It might be something we can look back and study if it happens, but because of how closed off DPRK is, it's really hard to answer. That said, there are a few things we do know that would help them out:\n\nFirst, cut defense spending. Their military spending is out of control and really hinders the people. Plus, a decrease in the size of the military would lead to more nations willing to have diplomatic relations with North Korea. \n\nNext, have diplomatic relations with other countries, in particularly the ones in the surrounding region. One of their largest problems is that they have very little trade routes and they severely mismanaged their natural resources.  \n\nOther than that, one could speculate removing certain key people from power would benefit the country. In particular, Kim Kyong-Hui would be a good person to remove. She runs Worker's Party of Korea and has an iron fist on political decisions. Some even argue that she's the one pulling the strings right now. Next would be her husband, Jang Sung-taek, who is considered to be second in power behind the Supreme Leader. It was thought that he was running North Korea from 2006 or later until Kim Jong Il's death. As he is also in charge of the National Defence Commission, he would be directly responsible for both attacks in 2010.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Well, this is a definite hypothetical. In practice, the only way for this to happen would be a complete uprising of the people or an act of legislation to limit the House to one term. Even then, it would probably be implemented to do elections every year so that only half the House would be lost. \n\nThere would be huge problems, especially on the Appropriations and Budget Committees. These committees spend most of the year just getting the budget correct and consist of mostly long term Congress members (5+ terms) who have lots of experience in what they are doing. If all of a sudden you had 435 new members in the House that had to assign committees then execute their tasks, it would be utter chaos. Likely, the Government would go into default. Think of the Fiscal Cliff problem we have now, but with a bunch of people who don't know what they are doing. \n\nOne of the biggest implications would be the likely deterioration of the party lines we see currently in Congress. The sharp divide is currently the most divided the House has been since the build up to the Civil War. A lot of this sharp contrast in opinions is artificially built up by the super elites of each party. There are numerous reasons for this, the largest being that it helps get their party elected. With 435 new members, the institutions that have been built up over decades are instantly gone, so therefore you have a blank slate to work with. Considering that most Americans aren't as far right or as far left as the House makes it seem, there would probably be a greater push towards the middle. It's tough to say exactly what would happen, but I hope that made some since. \n\nThe next huge thing would be the war chests and PAC funding of existing members of Congress. We are talking about over a billion dollars of money that has to be spent on Campaigns. That means that former members of Congress would have a lot of political capital to invest in campaigns nation wide. A lot of this money would likely end up back in the House, so you'd start to see corruption (again) and factions of the super elite, once again. Very likely, this use of funding would likely be used to determine the next Speaker and minority leader. In the short run, there'd be a pretty level playing field, but over the course of the next few elections, a clear ruling class would emerge, as we currently see. \n\nI don't think you can really say if this would be good or bad. Probably both.
