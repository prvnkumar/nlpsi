Medicaid would be eliminated, and the cost of federal and state dollars is enormous there. Same for VA, Tricare, IHS, SCHIP. Not to mention the fact that there are huge existing subsidies that wouldn't be a factor, like the subsidization of premiums by using pre-tax income.

His analysis is based on geopolitical boundaries, with no regard for how Metropolitan Areas actually work.  For example, the city of Redmond, WA (where Microsoft is based) has a population of only about 55k people, yet it is unquestionably part of the Seattle Major Metropolitan Area, which, all told, jumps the area referred to as \"Seattle\" from 620k to 3.4M people who have basically the same, Major-City interests.

There is an arrogance to it, an \"I'm right and you're wrong\" which I don't think has any basis in reality. You say you're not religious, which, I guess, is an attempt to appeal to Reddit's atheist majority, but for me that just makes it worse. At least they think there is a higher power that has decreed these things to be wrong.

The great thing about a fiat currency is that you have utter and complete control of the money supply. We're printing more money now, because inflation is negligible, and the economy needs a boost. In the late 70's we jacked interests rates to the moon and crushed inflation, and in the '90s we did it to manage the .com boom.

When the market tanked, and shit hit the fan, everyone started trying to cash out their currency. Hoover was forced to jack interest rates *up* to try and maintain enough gold locally to be able to print money. That tightened the credit market, causing even more damage to the economy.\n\nDidn't work very well either. Gold is an inflationary hedge, so people would have rather had gold than money, even with the high interest rates, and the economy got stuck in an deflationary death spiral.

Currency printing is the domain of the central banks, which are usually politically independent from the rest of the government in order to protect the public's confidence in their policies.  It would be *theoretically* possible for the Federal Reserve to wipe out the Federal deficit, but you're not going to find anyone on its board who thinks that's a good idea, so it won't happen.\n\nThe economic reason is the one you learned in your class.  Unlimited printing would cause hyperinflation, which can destroy an economy.  That's not a bogeyman, either, plenty of governments have done it and gotten those results; most famously Weimar Germany, or more recently, Zimbabwe until four years ago.\n\nThere are lots of people who share your opinion (including myself) that inflation in the US is too low, and thus *some* increased amount of printing is called for.  But central banks have to be careful with that sort of policy lest it get away from them.

In other words, printing enough money to solve our government problems could actually freeze up just as much money in the private sector?\n\nWell this makes me feel like I should first point out that the Fed is a public/private partnership; while private banks do have a voice in its management, the people with the most influence over top-level policy are public servants appointed by the government and don't have a direct personal stake in the performance of particular banks.\n\nAnyway, I'm not 100% sure I've understood your question correctly, but from what I *think* you meant, the answer is no.  The danger from excessive printing isn't that private sector lending will decline (at least not immediately), it's that hyperinflation would result.  Rapidly growing prices make it very hard for people to afford anything and for businesses to operate because their current revenues won't cover future costs.\n\nI suspect you may be thinking of the \"crowding out\" effect, which is a concern about excessive government *borrowing*.  Large government borrowing can drive up interest rates on public debt, which makes private loans less attractive, thereby reducing private investment.  At the moment, that sort of thing isn't really a concern in the US because interest rates on government debt are still very low.\n\n&gt;And I hear your two examples of hyperinflation often, but are there really a significant number of examples of this in countries that were not also ravaged by other problems of the grandest scale (massive debt/instability)?\n\nThere may be, but not that I can think of off the top of my head.  The sorts of problems that you're thinking of are usually the *reason* that a country resorts to extreme currency printing programs.  No government every really *wants* to just print its way to solvency, but it can sometimes seem like an easy (or the only) way out of dire financial straits.\n\n&gt;How many US dollars are in \"existence\" now? For hyperinflation to occur, wouldn't there need to be hundreds or thousands of times this amount printed? Given the magnitude of the dollar, would it be safe to assume that it is unlikely that even twice as many dollars should be printed? Even if we considered the possibility of $1 trillion platinum coins?\n\nHooo boy.  You should know that monetary economics is a pretty deep rabbit hole to jump down.  Basic principles can seem counterintuitive, and many things are controlled by beliefs and expectations rather than tangible quantities and facts.  You can make a legitimate argument that central bankers are con-men... because that's what they need to be in order for the economy to function at its best.\n\n*So:* what's total amount of US dollars?  The most accurate answer to that is \"nobody knows for certain\".  Money creation is hideously complicated and not controlled by any single institution (the Federal Reserve just has the *most* influence over it out of everyone).  It's only possible to *estimate* the total supply... but unfortunately the Fed stopped collecting statistics on its broadest measure of the money supply (which wasn't even as broad as it *could* be to begin with) in 2006.  Right now its estimate of just the \"monetary base\" (physical currency and bank reserves) is getting up to around [$3 trillion](http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/H3/Current/).  **M2**, the Fed's current broadest money measure, which includes less liquid assets like CDs, is closer to [$10 trillion](http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/current/h6.htm).\n\nFor hyperinflation to occur, technically all that needs to happen is for people to *expect* hyperinflation, as businesses will thus start raising their prices accordingly.  It's hard to say how much money we'd have to print to create those expectations.  This is why the Federal Reserve usually explains its policies along the lines of \"we're going to set interest rates at X and keep them there until inflation reaches level Y\"; they set policy and then adjust it on the fly according to the results they observe.\n\nAlso keep in mind that the rate at which currency circulates (called the \"velocity of money\") is just as important as the total amount of currency in circulation.  In a period of economic decline, you expect velocity to decrease because fewer people are trading as often, while the reverse is true during growth.  So if you imagine printing enough money to double the amount in circulation: if people are only exchanging that money one quarter as frequently as they used to, then you still wouldn't expect inflation to result.\n\n\n---\n\n\nSigh, I'm sure all of that mostly just served to befuddle everyone reading it, sorry.

The price of goods has **inflated**. \n\nIn a real economy, there are millions of goods and services to buy, but it's still a finite number. Printing more dollars devalues that currency and creates inflation. Americans can buy fewer goods and services with their money. While the Federal Reserve is printing a lot of money (~$80 billion, with a B, per month) inflation is historically low, if not nonexistent. \n\nAnd that's the Fed's job: controlling the money supply (number of dollars in the system) high enough to encourage job growth while keeping it low enough to prevent high inflation.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bx68k", "selftext": "Ok, thanks for the answer.

Obviously this means that there could be a warehouse full of apples nearby, but if you don't have any money...\n\nSo, a lot of food ends up rotting instead of being eaten, especially when austerity kicks in.  This is a problem not just with food, but as production becomes more and more automated, we're heading for the \"Google economy\" where lots of stuff is free, but no one has a job.  Look at Wikipedia, it's great.  But obviously it means nobody at Encyclopedia Brittanica has a job anymore.  I think we're seeing this on a large scale if you look at old shows like *Seinfeld* where people like Elaine work in publishing jobs which have since been replaced by the Internet and computers.  Look at old shows and you see legions of people sitting around doing jobs that don't need to be done anymore.\n\nWe're fast approaching the point where people don't *need* to be working 40 hours a week, but we still require them to.

But, most Americans don't *have* any savings.  They have debt.\n\nI'll put it another way.  If you took out a mortgage in 1970 for $30,000, that's a lot of money at first and you probably struggled to make your payments.  But, by the time 1990 rolled around, that same $30,000 mortgage is a joke.  You might as well pay off the remaining balance with loose change you find in your couch cushions.\n\nWell, I've got a $200,000 mortgage, so you can see why I'd be OK with some inflation if it means my income goes up.  My debt is fixed, it won't go up with inflation, but hopefully my income would.  Also, I think we owe it to seniors to give them some kind of stipend to live on to keep them out of poverty, as well as get them out of the work force so younger people can have those jobs.\n\nOf course, the people that make policy decisions tend to be the same people who hold my mortgage.   So for them, maybe inflation and Social Security are a bad thing?  I really don't see why though, unless it's ideological.  After all, a lot of that Social Security is so they can buy groceries from your store, or make payments on a car that came from your factory.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bx68k", "selftext": "Wow. Okay, there's a lot in here. \n\n1. I'm not a foodstuffs expert. I have no idea where you can go to get that answer. [Here's](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/worldwide-crisis-the-geopolitics-of-food-scarcity-a-606937.html) an article discussing what's driving global food scarcity. On a cursory read, it appears there *is* a scarcity problem. While many nations are wasteful in their food consumption, I do not find it credible that the waste of these nations is driving food scarcity in underdeveloped nations. Also, you need to consider transportation issues. Sure, there's an overabundance of ... apples ... in one part of the world. Can you effectively transport those apples to another part of the world cost effectively? Would it make more sense to find a substitute fruit to grow in the apple-less region?\n2. Yes, process automation is a driving force in the increase in worker productivity. That means that fewer humans are needed to do more things. [Here's an album](http://imgur.com/a/VYRqC) of tables that the [Bureau of Labor and Statistics](http://www.bls.gov/lpc/#tables) compiled showing the relative productive capacity and hourly compensation over time. The vertical grey bars indicate recessionary periods. \n3. There are some really interesting discussions on the future of an automated society in /r/automation. You should go ask them some of your questions as they'll be better equipped to answer you completely.\n4. True, Americans tend to save less than the average industrialized citizen. But that doesn't mean they *don't* save **at all**. \n5. Inflation is generally considered to be a bad thing for the economy in aggregate. But, in your debtor instance, inflation can help you repay your loans more easily. In fact, many large firms are currently taking out bonds or other debt instruments because the annual interest owed on those securities is less than inflation. So, the value of their dollar grows more than what they owe in interest. (Not to mention the [tax shield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_shield) benefit of having debt securities.)\n6. Seniors do receive a stipend to stay out of poverty in the US. It's called social security. And medicare. And pensions/401Ks/IRAs. Social security and medicare are both tied to inflation measures (consumer price indices) to ensure that the real value of disbursements is consistent over time. Currently, the US federal government is debating whether to change the CPI to what's called a \"[chain CPI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Chained_Consumer_Price_Index)\" that will reduce the amount of increased payments each year. Some argue that this will negatively impact seniors' ability to support themselves, while others argue that it won't and that changing to the chain CPI will reduce the federal deficit. \n6. The people who make policy decisions are elected officials. They do not hold your mortgage. Your mortgage is held by a bank, or more likely by Fannie Mae/Freddy Mac. While those are government owned entities, those who work for FM/FM are executive branch officials. Those who make the laws are legislative branch officials. There is a clear separation between the two. ", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bx68k", "selftext": "Thanks for the answer.

He talked about how he opened a storage shed business in California back when land was cheap.  He came from a poor family and didn't even have a high school education, but with a small business loan and a little elbow grease, he was able to become a millionaire.  In his view, anyone ought to be able to do the same.  Therefore, he has no sympathy for anyone on welfare, and only supports politicians who promise an end to \"aid-the-poor\" programs, which he believes make people lazy and shiftless.\n\nThe stuff about automation is terrifying.

Established under Title 10 and Title 32 of the U.S. Code, state National Guard serves as part of the first-line defense for the United States.[35] The state National Guard is divided up into units stationed in each of the 50 states and U.S. territories and operates under their respective state governor or territorial government.[36] The National Guard may be called up for active duty by the state governors or territorial commanding generals to help respond to domestic emergencies and disasters, such as those caused by hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes.[36]\n\n&gt;The National Guard of the United States is a military reserve force composed of state National Guard members or units under federally recognized active or inactive armed force service for the United States.[37][38] Created by the Militia Act of 1903, the National Guard of the United States is a joint reserve component of the United States Army and the United States Air Force.\n\nSo, \"National Guard\" has more than one meaning. The US NG is part of the us Military (*not* a militia), the State's NG is an *organized militia*.\n\nHowever, as from Heller, neither is the \"unorganized\" or \"citizens\" militia to which the 2A refers, as they were created by federal law and not in existence before the Constitution.\n\nAt the top of that article, the difference is further highlighted:\n\n* The organized militia created by the Militia Act of 1903, which split from the 1792 Uniform Militia forces, and consist of State militia forces, notably the National Guard and the Naval Militia.[2] The National Guard however, is not to be confused with the National Guard of the United States, which is a federally recognized reserve military force, although the two are linked.\n* The reserve militia[3] or unorganized militia, which is presently defined by the Militia Act of 1903 to consist of every able-bodied man of at least 17 and under 45 years of age who is not a member of the National Guard or Naval Militia.(That is, anyone who would be eligible for a draft.) Former members of the armed forces up to age 65 are also considered part of the \"unorganized militia\" per Sec 313 Title 32 of the US Code.[2]\n", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "id": "t1_c972xby", "parent_id": "t1_c96sklq", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431698010, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c972xby", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364925664", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "id": "t1_c96sklq", "parent_id": "t1_c96ptrg", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431702959, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96sklq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364878373", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "id": "t1_c96ptrg", "parent_id": "t1_c96ntbk", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431704254, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96ptrg", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364869412", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "id": "t1_c96ntbk", "parent_id": "t1_c96k4mx", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431705214, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96ntbk", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364863260", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "id": "t1_c96k4mx", "parent_id": "t1_c965kz6", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431706951, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96k4mx", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364853847", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "selftext": "As to straw purchases, I think we need to better define the actual offense.

If there are 100 people who want guns, you need to smuggle 100 guns. Period. If there are 100 people who want heroin, you have to smuggle enough heroin for 100 people, and then do it again when all of the junkies need another hit.\n\n&gt;That's not what I hear.\n\nFeinstein's report? She consistently lies about statistics to push her shitty legislation. Here is her statistic:\n\n&gt;&gt;In a June 9, 2011 response to an inquiry from Senator Feinstein, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) Acting Director Kenneth Melson stated that of the 29,284 firearms recovered in Mexico in 2009 and 2010 and submitted to the ATF National Tracing Center, 20,504 were United States sourced.\n\n[Here's](http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20110209-mexicos-gun-supply-and-90-percent-myth) an article debunking that. Basically, it's selection bias: Mexico only submits the firearms they think the ATF will be able to trace. They do not submit the firearms that came from their own government, were traced to Mexican citizens, or that could not have come from the US.\n\nShe then goes on to quote other Democratic politicans, and advocate her own AWB and Project Gunrunner (which was a miserable failure because of the gross incompetence and negligence of federal officials). \n\n&gt;Yes. It is completely ridiculous to imply that this is a reason not to do anything. Why is less killing not good enough?\n\nYou seem to think that an Assault Weapon Ban would result in less killing. Well, the CDC, DoJ, and National Research Council all found that the 1994 Assault Ban did not measurably decrease the US murder rate. Do you have better evidence than they do?\n\n&gt;\"No matter how effective your umbrella is, you're still gonna get some water on you.

Established under Title 10 and Title 32 of the U.S. Code, state National Guard serves as part of the first-line defense for the United States.[35] The state National Guard is divided up into units stationed in each of the 50 states and U.S. territories and operates under their respective state governor or territorial government.[36] The National Guard may be called up for active duty by the state governors or territorial commanding generals to help respond to domestic emergencies and disasters, such as those caused by hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes.[36]\n\n&gt;The National Guard of the United States is a military reserve force composed of state National Guard members or units under federally recognized active or inactive armed force service for the United States.[37][38] Created by the Militia Act of 1903, the National Guard of the United States is a joint reserve component of the United States Army and the United States Air Force.\n\nSo, \"National Guard\" has more than one meaning. The US NG is part of the us Military (*not* a militia), the State's NG is an *organized militia*.\n\nHowever, as from Heller, neither is the \"unorganized\" or \"citizens\" militia to which the 2A refers, as they were created by federal law and not in existence before the Constitution.\n\nAt the top of that article, the difference is further highlighted:\n\n* The organized militia created by the Militia Act of 1903, which split from the 1792 Uniform Militia forces, and consist of State militia forces, notably the National Guard and the Naval Militia.[2] The National Guard however, is not to be confused with the National Guard of the United States, which is a federally recognized reserve military force, although the two are linked.\n* The reserve militia[3] or unorganized militia, which is presently defined by the Militia Act of 1903 to consist of every able-bodied man of at least 17 and under 45 years of age who is not a member of the National Guard or Naval Militia.(That is, anyone who would be eligible for a draft.) Former members of the armed forces up to age 65 are also considered part of the \"unorganized militia\" per Sec 313 Title 32 of the US Code.[2]\n", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "id": "t1_c972xby", "parent_id": "t1_c96sklq", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431698010, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c972xby", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364925664", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "id": "t1_c96sklq", "parent_id": "t1_c96ptrg", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431702959, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96sklq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364878373", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "id": "t1_c96ptrg", "parent_id": "t1_c96ntbk", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431704254, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96ptrg", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364869412", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "id": "t1_c96ntbk", "parent_id": "t1_c96k4mx", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431705214, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96ntbk", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364863260", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "id": "t1_c96k4mx", "parent_id": "t1_c965kz6", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431706951, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96k4mx", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364853847", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "selftext": "As to straw purchases, I think we need to better define the actual offense.

The reason so many American guns are being smuggled to Mexico is that guns are so much easier to get in America than in Mexico. A certain fraction of a given countries problems, be it crime or drugs or guns or anything else, can spill over a border. Right now some of our gun control problem is spilling over onto their side of the border. But it's not true that just because their efforts at gun control are degraded by our policies, they shouldn't bother - and it certainly is nonsensical to say that we shouldn't bother because of this circumstance.\n\nThe point is that they *are* being smuggled. They actually aren't being smuggled from the US in large numbers; most cartels' weapons came from the Mexican government or were smuggled from overseas. The point is: Mexico has incredibly strict gun control laws and yet they're readily available.\n\n&gt;Mhm. Not nearly comprable to the ease with which perfectly good, whole, sellable drugs can be produced at home.\n\nSure, it's probably easier to throw some Miracle-gro on your pot plant than it is to obtain the machinery to manufacture banned weapons (or magazines). This isn't a contest, though. You said that drugs were easy to grow, and I said that 30-round AR-15 magazines are easy to make; those statements aren't mutually exclusive.\n\n&gt;Yep, that's true. It's also not contrary evidence to my argument.\n\nThe point is that *no matter how strict you make gun laws, people will still kill each other* (and often with weapons that are restricted). In Japan, it is almost completely illegal to own a firearm (the exceptions are very limited), but there are still a dozen or so firearm homicides each year. Since it is impossible to legally buy a semi-automatic pistol there, the Yakuza smuggle them in from China and the Philippines.

They are just on completely different scales. \n\n&gt;I carry concealed whenever it's legal, and nobody ever notices.\n\nYou carry *one* small pistol concealed, and nobody notices. How many do you think you can carry concealed without anybody notices? Compare that to the amount of drugs you can carry concealed without anybody notices - and the relative value of those two things. Keep in mind that a pound of marijuana is worth roughly $1000.

They are just on completely different scales.\n\n[This](http://www.drugwardistortions.org/distortion19.htm) may not be an accurate source, but it says that Americans spent about $64 billion on drugs in 2000. [This](http://www.statisticbrain.com/firearm-industry-statistics/) puts the total revenue for the US firearms industry at $11 billion. I'd attribute a lot of the drug spending to the fact that they're illegal, but in any case they're in the same order of magnitude.\n\n&gt;You carry one small pistol concealed, and nobody notices. How many do you think you can carry concealed without anybody notices? Compare that to the amount of drugs you can carry concealed without anybody notices - and the relative value of those two things. Keep in mind that a pound of marijuana is worth roughly $1000.

If we're talking cocaine or heroin, we're talking on the order of tens of thousands of dollars per pound. And all of the above comparisons.\n\nThey also don't have distinctive smells, can be disguised as other things (such as machine parts), etc. It's definitely easier to smuggle a large dollar amount of drugs than a large dollar amount of guns, but you also don't need to *keep* smuggling guns, at least not at the same rate. If there are 100 people who want guns, you need to smuggle 100 guns. Period. If there are 100 people who want heroin, you have to smuggle enough heroin for 100 people, and then do it again when all of the junkies need another hit.\n\n&gt;That's not what I hear.\n\nFeinstein's report? She consistently lies about statistics to push her shitty legislation. Here is her statistic:\n\n&gt;&gt;In a June 9, 2011 response to an inquiry from Senator Feinstein, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) Acting Director Kenneth Melson stated that of the 29,284 firearms recovered in Mexico in 2009 and 2010 and submitted to the ATF National Tracing Center, 20,504 were United States sourced.\n\n[Here's](http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20110209-mexicos-gun-supply-and-90-percent-myth) an article debunking that. Basically, it's selection bias: Mexico only submits the firearms they think the ATF will be able to trace. They do not submit the firearms that came from their own government, were traced to Mexican citizens, or that could not have come from the US.\n\nShe then goes on to quote other Democratic politicans, and advocate her own AWB and Project Gunrunner (which was a miserable failure because of the gross incompetence and negligence of federal officials). \n\n&gt;Yes. It is completely ridiculous to imply that this is a reason not to do anything. Why is less killing not good enough?\n\nYou seem to think that an Assault Weapon Ban would result in less killing. Well, the CDC, DoJ, and National Research Council all found that the 1994 Assault Ban did not measurably decrease the US murder rate. Do you have better evidence than they do?\n\n&gt;\"No matter how effective your umbrella is, you're still gonna get some water on you. So why bother?\"\n\nIn this case, it's an expensive umbrella that fucks with your fellow citizens and does not block a measurable amount of water.

Established under Title 10 and Title 32 of the U.S. Code, state National Guard serves as part of the first-line defense for the United States.[35] The state National Guard is divided up into units stationed in each of the 50 states and U.S. territories and operates under their respective state governor or territorial government.[36] The National Guard may be called up for active duty by the state governors or territorial commanding generals to help respond to domestic emergencies and disasters, such as those caused by hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes.[36]\n\n&gt;The National Guard of the United States is a military reserve force composed of state National Guard members or units under federally recognized active or inactive armed force service for the United States.[37][38] Created by the Militia Act of 1903, the National Guard of the United States is a joint reserve component of the United States Army and the United States Air Force.\n\nSo, \"National Guard\" has more than one meaning. The US NG is part of the us Military (*not* a militia), the State's NG is an *organized militia*.\n\nHowever, as from Heller, neither is the \"unorganized\" or \"citizens\" militia to which the 2A refers, as they were created by federal law and not in existence before the Constitution.\n\nAt the top of that article, the difference is further highlighted:\n\n* The organized militia created by the Militia Act of 1903, which split from the 1792 Uniform Militia forces, and consist of State militia forces, notably the National Guard and the Naval Militia.[2] The National Guard however, is not to be confused with the National Guard of the United States, which is a federally recognized reserve military force, although the two are linked.\n* The reserve militia[3] or unorganized militia, which is presently defined by the Militia Act of 1903 to consist of every able-bodied man of at least 17 and under 45 years of age who is not a member of the National Guard or Naval Militia.(That is, anyone who would be eligible for a draft.) Former members of the armed forces up to age 65 are also considered part of the \"unorganized militia\" per Sec 313 Title 32 of the US Code.[2]\n", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "id": "t1_c972xby", "parent_id": "t1_c96sklq", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431698010, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c972xby", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364925664", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "id": "t1_c96sklq", "parent_id": "t1_c96ptrg", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431702959, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96sklq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364878373", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "id": "t1_c96ptrg", "parent_id": "t1_c96ntbk", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431704254, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96ptrg", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364869412", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "id": "t1_c96ntbk", "parent_id": "t1_c96k4mx", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431705214, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96ntbk", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364863260", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "2A_is_the_best_A", "id": "t1_c96k4mx", "parent_id": "t1_c965kz6", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431706951, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c96k4mx", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364853847", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bdn8o", "selftext": "As to straw purchases, I think we need to better define the actual offense.

I don't mind a bit of government regulation, such as back ground checks etc. The thing is, they are notoriously awful at regulating anything. I just don't think it will be effective. A lot of states already have regulations like these, and they just simply aren't enforced. The ATF would rather lock up pot smokers. Also think about driving, just because some 16 year can pass a 20 minute test, doesn't mean they won't drive like an asshole 10 years later. Hell, even after you get a DUI, it doesn't mean you can't get on the road without a license and go crash into a bus full of kids. It just means you'll get punished afterwards. All of these school shooters are getting punished afterwards, which is how the system works. What anti gun people are doing, is trying to create preventative laws. They are trying to stop crime from happening, instead of punishing when it does. Part of being free is knowing that some people will make the wrong choices.
