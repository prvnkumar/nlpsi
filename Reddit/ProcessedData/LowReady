I guess you'll just ignore this.\n\n&gt;Well only because you've said so, apparently. \n\nNo.  The law says so.  You'll also ignore this.\n\n&gt;Nice straw man. We're talking about one decision \n\nThe US government interned Japanese during WWII.  It's the government stepping in and removing liberty.  I could give you many more examples, but you'll just ignore the facts.\n\n&gt;many define as \"murder\"\n\nMurder differs from culture to culture, also there is intent, state of mind, and reason.  You can call it murder all day long, but it legally isn't where I live.  If a woman is raped, is she forced to have the child?  How about if her life is at stake?  If not, then why is one type of 'murder' ok.  \n\nAlso, It weakens your argument considerably when you are flippant and say to me, 'only because you say so.'  And then you use, 'many define.'  I guess you'll just ignore this, too.\n\n&gt;First abortion, next internment camps. \n\nActually, it does work that way.  There's the famous quote about doing nothing when the Nazis put the Jews in camps.  I'm sure you know it.  Government loves power and removing liberty.  It's done in the name of safety (Patriot Act), the War on Drugs, or saving the children.  The current rounds of Anti-Abortion legislation (Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin) all have similar wording that will benefit the drug companies that provide drugs like the morning after pill.  Access is limited and costs go through the roof.  More government intervention... from Republicans who always talk of getting the government out of our lives.  Step by step the government tells you how to live your life.  Honestly, if you don't like abortion, just don't have one, and make sure young women have access to contraception, education, and employment opportunities.  Also, advocate for programs that eliminate the cycle of poverty.

Many pro-life advocates with whom I have spoken in the past have acknowledged that the basis for their pro-life position was grounded in their Christian faith.  This always brings up another question regarding the pro-life movement.  If pro-life stances are founded on Christianity, how does one square the support for birth with abandoning the needs of the impoverished after they are born.  That appears to be inconsistent with the tenets of Christianity and what Jesus stood for in his life.
