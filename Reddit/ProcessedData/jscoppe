I submit Hans Hoppe's proposed 4-step free market/laissez-faire solution:\n\n&gt;1. Eliminate all licensing requirements for medical schools, hospitals, pharmacies, and medical doctors and other health care personnel. Their supply would almost instantly increase, prices would fall, and a greater variety of health care services would appear on the market. Competing voluntary accreditation agencies would take the place of compulsory government licensing--if health care providers believe that such accreditation would enhance their own reputation, and that their consumers care about reputation, and are willing to pay for it. Because consumers would no longer be duped into believing that there is such a thing as a \"national standard\" of health care, they will increase their search costs and make more discriminating health care choices.\n\n&gt;2. Eliminate all government restrictions on the production and sale of pharmaceutical products and medical devices. This means no more Food and Drug Administration, which presently hinders innovation and increases costs. Costs and prices would fall, and a wider variety of better products would reach the market sooner. The market would force consumers to act in accordance with their own--rather than the government's--risk assessment. And competing drug and device manufacturers and sellers, to safeguard against product liability suits as much as to attract customers, would provide increasingly better product descriptions and guarantees.\n\n&gt;3. Deregulate the health insurance industry. Private enterprise can offer insurance against events over whose outcome the insured possesses no control. One cannot insure oneself against suicide or bankruptcy, for example, because it is in one's own hands to bring these events about... To deregulate the industry means to restore it to unrestricted freedom of contract: to allow a health insurer to offer any contract whatsoever, to include or exclude any risk, and to discriminate among any groups of individuals. Uninsurable risks would lose coverage, the variety of insurance policies for the remaining coverage would increase, and price differentials would reflect genuine insurance risks. On average, prices would drastically fall. And the reform would restore individual responsibility in health care.\n\n&gt;4. Eliminate all subsidies to the sick or unhealthy. Subsidies create more of whatever is being subsidized. Subsidies for the ill and diseased breed illness and disease, and promote carelessness, indigence, and dependency.

The idea that people are choosing illness because they know that some sort of health care subsidy is going to catch them is crazy; it would require a high burden of proof. In a best-case scenario, people are going to get sick anyway.\n\nFinally, I'll note that this \"free-market\" solution doesn't mention the elephant in the room, which for some reason \"free-market\" capitalists seem content to ignore: government-granted patent monopolies, which result in pharma companies and medical device manufacturers charging tens of times the free-market price for their products and making off with hundreds of billions of dollars of the American public's money every year. This is probably one of THE most significant health care costs, and it is almost literally the government taking money from the public and handing it over to pharma companies.

Competition in ratings bureaus never provides optimal results because there will always be monopolizing incentives to cover as much as possible, and then the monopoly will effectively be a new \"government standard,\" only governed by private interests.\n\n&gt;Because consumers would no longer be duped into believing that there is such a thing as a \"national standard\" of health care, they will increase their search costs and make more discriminating health care choices.\n\nIndividuals are not qualified to even know what a good doctor or hospital looks like; what if there is only one hospital because it's a small, rural area; also, most people in emergencies just go for the closest hospital, and if you call 911, you don't even get a choice on that.\n\n&gt;Eliminate all government restrictions on the production and sale of pharmaceutical products and medical devices.

Private enterprise can offer insurance against events over whose outcome the insured possesses no control. One cannot insure oneself against suicide or bankruptcy, for example, because it is in one's own hands to bring these events about... To deregulate the industry means to restore it to unrestricted freedom of contract: to allow a health insurer to offer any contract whatsoever, to include or exclude any risk, and to discriminate among any groups of individuals. Uninsurable risks would lose coverage, the variety of insurance policies for the remaining coverage would increase, and price differentials would reflect genuine insurance risks. On average, prices would drastically fall. And the reform would restore individual responsibility in health care.\n\nI see nothing here that is not exactly what the US had pre-ACA. This will just result in more bankruptcies, more expensive care, and more exclusion based upon arbitrary standards.\n\n&gt;Eliminate all subsidies to the sick or unhealthy. Subsidies create more of whatever is being subsidized. Subsidies for the ill and diseased breed illness and disease, and promote carelessness, indigence, and dependency. If we eliminate them, we would strengthen the will to live healthy lives and to work for a living. In the first instance, that means abolishing Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nWow. Just wow. Literally \"fuck sick people.\" \n\n\"Want to get health care? Don't get born with any genetic conditions.\"\n\n&gt;I foresee only increased government control, and with it increased costs and/or decreased quality of care.\n\nYes, exactly like all of the countries with Single Payer, which have vastly higher-priced and lower-quality health care than the U.S.\n\nOh wait.\n\nThe \"free market\" doesn't work for health care the same way it wouldn't work for drinking water or air.

When a new political party dedicated to the abolition of slavery (The Republican Party) came to power, the southern states realized they had lost the argument and resorted to secession.  \n\nBut don't take my word for it.  A number of the southern states **explicitly** cited slavery as the reason for their seceding in their Articles of Secession.  Take Georgia, for example:\n\n\"The people of Georgia having dissolved their political connection with the Government of the United States of America, present to their confederates and the world the causes which have led to the separation. **For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slave-holding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery.

This, I believe, is something that is used to cloud the fact that he did in fact suspend habeas corpus and he did take away a lot of the rights of Southern citizens.  The war was started over the fact that the federal government was infringing upon the rights of the states and of the individual, and then it morphed into a issue of slavery.  The fact that slavery is at the forefront when we talk about the Civil War is appalling because the real question of the war was again individual and state rights.  The Confederates were not evil people by nature, they were just trying as hard as they could to save and be able to maintain their way of life.  John C. Calhoun fought against Andrew Jackson much earlier on the same issues and managed to maintain peace and discourse.

That's just the definition.\n\n&gt;What is wrong with changing future earnings of the rich which obviously they don't own yet.\n\nWhen you are taxed on income, the income must logically be assessed first. Ergo, people earn the money, and *then* it is taken via taxation. Withholding from paychecks is just a matter of bookkeeping; it's a relatively new practice. Income tax used to have to be paid in a lump sum every year.\n\nSo people do own the money, and then it is taken from them.\n\n&gt;When the economy goes bad it shouldn't always have to be the people at the bottom have to be hit the hardest.\n\n\"When a new strain of the flu goes around, it shouldn't always have to be the people with the weakest immune systems to be hit the hardest.\"\n\nThe point of the above statement is that it doesn't matter to the universe what preference you hold; the truth of the matter is that those in the weaker positions will assuredly be hit harder by such an event.\n\n&gt;When you have a company giving such huge salaries at the top even when things are going bad that is a problem.\n\nHow is that *necessarily* a problem? Can you support your claim?\n\n&gt;It isn't like a person who made 10 million one year versus 500,000 the next is going to starve and not put his kids through college anymore.\n\nYou're talking about marginal utility.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_18w3zb", "selftext": "You have a typical superficial and flawed understanding of what social contracts really are. \n\nChaosMotor [explains it here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/102sj5/problem_with_the_social_contact/c69xkbe?context=2) better than I ever could, so I'll just quote him:\n\n&gt;Social contracts inform others expectations of how you will behave, based on prior experience. Social contracts, being social, can only exist between persons, and are only binding to the extent that, in essence, \"you have previously observed me to act in this manner, and you can be assured that this is the manner in which I will continue to act\".\n\n&gt;Notice that these are individual, two party contracts. \"This is how I will treat you, and this is how you will treat me\". These \"contracts\" are immediately, regularly, and constantly modified by our observation of other's behavior. If someone who has previously given you no threat of violence punches you in the face, their SC with you has been modified to warn you that further punchings may be had, and now your SC with them must be modified to respect this risk.\n\n&gt;That is at its fundamental level, what a social contract is - your informed expectation of how others will treat you, and how you will respond to their treatment. Note the lack of a state at any point in this construct. A state is a mutually shared illusion between many parties, not just two parties, and thus cannot be justified by SCs.\n\n&gt;Statists like to justify the state through social contracts, by claiming that SCs are the basis of the state, and the state is the formalization of the most generally shared characteristics of the SCs, such as, most people mutually agree that they will not commit violence on others, and will respond to violence committed against themselves.\n\n&gt;A statist points to this mutuality among diverse SCs and says \"here, the people have agreed to the police\". But this ignores that the SCs are mutable and constantly mutating. So an establishment or fixture cannot be supported by SCs because SCs change constantly, and the purpose of an establishment (such as a police agency) is to not change.\n\n&gt;So, the state is not based upon SCs, and SCs do not justify the state. At best, SCs inform what kinds of behavioral expectations are widely shared, which in some ways is reflected in the state's actions, but by no means does the fact that I treat you this way and you treat me that way justify that we impose our manners of mutual treatment on an uninvolved third party. That is to say, SCs do not justify the state.\n\nSocial contracts are not the same thing as more traditional contracts like hiring a plumber to fix your pipes.

Social contracts, being social, can only exist between persons, and are only binding to the extent that, in essence, \"you have previously observed me to act in this manner, and you can be assured that this is the manner in which I will continue to act\".\n\n&gt;Notice that these are individual, two party contracts. \"This is how I will treat you, and this is how you will treat me\". These \"contracts\" are immediately, regularly, and constantly modified by our observation of other's behavior. If someone who has previously given you no threat of violence punches you in the face, their SC with you has been modified to warn you that further punchings may be had, and now your SC with them must be modified to respect this risk.\n\n&gt;That is at its fundamental level, what a social contract is - your informed expectation of how others will treat you, and how you will respond to their treatment. Note the lack of a state at any point in this construct. A state is a mutually shared illusion between many parties, not just two parties, and thus cannot be justified by SCs.\n\n&gt;Statists like to justify the state through social contracts, by claiming that SCs are the basis of the state, and the state is the formalization of the most generally shared characteristics of the SCs, such as, most people mutually agree that they will not commit violence on others, and will respond to violence committed against themselves.\n\n&gt;A statist points to this mutuality among diverse SCs and says \"here, the people have agreed to the police\". But this ignores that the SCs are mutable and constantly mutating. So an establishment or fixture cannot be supported by SCs because SCs change constantly, and the purpose of an establishment (such as a police agency) is to not change.\n\n&gt;So, the state is not based upon SCs, and SCs do not justify the state. At best, SCs inform what kinds of behavioral expectations are widely shared, which in some ways is reflected in the state's actions, but by no means does the fact that I treat you this way and you treat me that way justify that we impose our manners of mutual treatment on an uninvolved third party. That is to say, SCs do not justify the state.\n\nSocial contracts are not the same thing as more traditional contracts like hiring a plumber to fix your pipes. They are a wholly different beast.\n\n&gt;Get over it.\n\nThis is a sign of intellectual laziness if I've ever seen it.\n\n&gt;If you want to live the libertarian dream where everything you earn is yours by right, move\n\n\"This is 'Murica.

This may not be the case at all, very reasonable as well (though higher output generally necessitates more attention or new skills or more workers or something - I am watching this happen where I work, new machines go a lot faster pump out a lot more stuff and the operators are not happy about how much more demanding these machines are. They also had to learn a ton of new software and how to operate these machines. That, to me, deserves more pay especially if the machine is generating more money or saving more money.), but in this case the value of the worker placed at that machine has been shifted, previously they were worth X because the machine put out Y if the Y goes up then the X should too because their value in relation to what they are producing has gone up. Now if it is .20 cents per hour they may only be entitled to .001% of that based on whatever determined their original wages but I don't understand why when a company begins to do better its employees should not also do better.

As soon as the lowest skilled labor dries up at, say, $3/hr, the employers who still need people will have to offer $3.50/hr. The people making $3 leave their jobs for the other ones offering $4. The competition ends around the place where the labor would cost too much to warrant offering such a position.

There are certain minimum wage workers who, if paid much more, would cause the collapse of their business but these workers are limited to mom and pop shops that have the competition of giant companies that have the economy of mass production and uniformity. If these giant companies had to pay the same percentage that the mom and pop shops paid then people would be making livable wages and the mom and pop shops would stand a better chance because the price of their goods or services would not be undercut by the fraction that mass production yields and therefore the original issue would not be an issue anymore.\n\nOf course there are pros and cons, and yes I did get a little dogmatic, you are right.

This may not be the case at all, very reasonable as well (though higher output generally necessitates more attention or new skills or more workers or something - I am watching this happen where I work, new machines go a lot faster pump out a lot more stuff and the operators are not happy about how much more demanding these machines are. They also had to learn a ton of new software and how to operate these machines. That, to me, deserves more pay especially if the machine is generating more money or saving more money.), but in this case the value of the worker placed at that machine has been shifted, previously they were worth X because the machine put out Y if the Y goes up then the X should too because their value in relation to what they are producing has gone up. Now if it is .20 cents per hour they may only be entitled to .001% of that based on whatever determined their original wages but I don't understand why when a company begins to do better its employees should not also do better. I understand there is no legal reason for this, I am talking from a moral and responsible standpoint.\n\nNow if we take that example and assume that this happened once a year or even every few years and no adjustment was made for the worker after 20 years the company would be earning $4 more dollars per hour per employee. Yes, the machines cost money to replace, maybe more electricity, and other factors as well. This should be calculated in but doesn't negate the fact that the worker is still responsible for N% of production and their wages are based off of that and have not been adjusted to reflect that.\n\nI will be back at some point because I enjoy this and you have made some good points that I have enjoyed reading and responding to.

This is outright false, only where there is a system in place to provide at least hope to these people this will happen at a certain point. That point are the workers lining up for jobs that you are referring to. What would all those people waiting in line every day say to a $4 an hour offer when they were standing in line for a %5 an hour job?

And yes, we need laws to prevent things that aren't likely to happen because they still do happen and there needs to be an understanding that even if those things seem unlikely or impossible they are still not allowed. I personally can't conceive of any situation when murder would become an option but I am sure as fuck happy that it is illegal. (I assume that statement will need clarification: I understand murder to defend one's self or if someone raped someone etc. etc. but I also can't conceive of the motivation for those initial actions. I understand that it happens but not only can I not stomach thought it honestly doesn't make sense to me. So no event that could spur the idea of murder becoming feasible could happen in the first place. Turtles all the way down.)\n\nMinimum wage laws have negative economic effects? Like what? Giant corporations raking in preposterous amounts of money move to where they have cheaper labor so they can rake in an even more preposterous amount of money on the backs of the less fortunate? I think that is a moral failing and not a economic one and certainly something that we should be addressing as such. \n\nThe positive effects are creating an economy of people who all have the ability to provide for themselves and also dedicate themselves to working hard enough to do even better than the bare minimum of surviving.

This may not be the case at all, very reasonable as well (though higher output generally necessitates more attention or new skills or more workers or something - I am watching this happen where I work, new machines go a lot faster pump out a lot more stuff and the operators are not happy about how much more demanding these machines are. They also had to learn a ton of new software and how to operate these machines. That, to me, deserves more pay especially if the machine is generating more money or saving more money.), but in this case the value of the worker placed at that machine has been shifted, previously they were worth X because the machine put out Y if the Y goes up then the X should too because their value in relation to what they are producing has gone up. Now if it is .20 cents per hour they may only be entitled to .001% of that based on whatever determined their original wages but I don't understand why when a company begins to do better its employees should not also do better. I understand there is no legal reason for this, I am talking from a moral and responsible standpoint.\n\nNow if we take that example and assume that this happened once a year or even every few years and no adjustment was made for the worker after 20 years the company would be earning $4 more dollars per hour per employee. Yes, the machines cost money to replace, maybe more electricity, and other factors as well. This should be calculated in but doesn't negate the fact that the worker is still responsible for N% of production and their wages are based off of that and have not been adjusted to reflect that.\n\nI will be back at some point because I enjoy this and you have made some good points that I have enjoyed reading and responding to.
