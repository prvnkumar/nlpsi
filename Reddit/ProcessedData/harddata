Parents can claim children as dependents but that does not grant them total control of the child's assets in all cases (child stars often set up legal trusts that control most of their assets until they turn 18). \n\n4. Parents do not always have to file taxes that include a child's assets (if the child has a lower tax rate they can file separately)\n\nSo it's complicated. For political purposes, you exercise your rights through your parents/guardians. For tax purposes you can be your own entity to a degree. For the purposes of civil law, it depends on the state whether a suit comes after the child, the child and the parent, or just the parent (considering the child as part of their entity). \n\nThe laws in the final case are funny since from a common law perspective children were originally considered separate, but in the US states have passed laws to make parents liable for the actions of their kids.\n\nSo if you don't like the taxes you'll pay when you file your returns, blame your parents.

It's democratic, so you're best bet is in the senate since they control what comes to a vote (and no member of the GOP leadership supports the bill)\n\nSo call the sponsors. Call Senator Markey, call Debbie Stabenow. Ask them why it hasn't gotten a hearing in the senate finance committee. It may be because it doesn't have enough co-sponsors.\n\nIf that's the case, you have three people you have real sway over: your house member and your senators. None support it currently. You should go to the democrats given the current breakdown in sponsorship. Find out what local groups they get money from, what organizations they care about. \n\nThen lobby those people. Bring your mom to meet with them, if it's business owners or veterans, or union leaders, ask for 20 minutes to tell your story. Tell them you know that Senator X cares about their opinion. Ask them how Alzheimer's has affected them. Share your story. Ask them to consider supporting the bill.\n\nIn six months, once you've spoken with people from every major interest group the senator takes money from, write him a letter, include the names of the people or groups in his district who now support the bill and ask him for 30 minutes to discuss the bill and learn his reservations. If you put the time in, you might just get a sitdown. \n\nThat's how you change a politicians mind.\n\nAlso, if you're a republican, or your mom is, use that with the GOP. Same with Dems, but many of them already support the bill so it's less hard.\n\nAlso, it's a funding bill is why they don't all love it. It's asking for $100 M in funding, not an easy sell during the sequester. \n\nAnd it's called the \"Health Outcomes, Planning and Education for Alzheimer\u2019s (HOPE) Act [H.R. 1507]\" now, the Hope for Alzheimer's act was the bill introduced in 2010.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n\n", "id": "t1_cdh2bd6", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "harddata", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1qusk4", "selftext": "I find it kind of funny that Markey's NOT on the bill now that he's in the Senate.", "id": "t1_cdikzu4", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "congressional_staffr", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cdh2bd6", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428586118, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdikzu4", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384922983", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t3_1qusk4", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1428612271, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdh2bd6", "author_flair_text": "[Political Consultant/BA Pol Sci][Center-Left]", "created_utc": "1384770953", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}

First, the size of the state has nothing to do with whether or not they accepted medicaid expansion. \n\nKentucky has a 40 billion dollar budget. Tennessee has a 60 billion dollar budget. Big states, small states, all accepted medicaid funding. The discriminating factor wasn't state budget size, it was which party controlled the capitol. If it was up to democrats, the state accepted the funding. If it was up to republicans, the state did not.\n\nThere were even a few cases where the republicans sucked it up and did it because the deal was just too good to pass up (Ohio and Arizona are good examples)\n\nWhat do I mean by a good deal? For the first three years, the medicaid expansion is 100% paid for. It's free money for those three years. After three years, it gradually increases up to a whopping total of 10% of the cost. \n\nYes, you read that right, the federal government will cover 90% of the cost of the expansion. So what the states are saying to the poor is \"we can't give you better healthcare because we can't bring ourselves to pay 10% of the cost eventually. \n\nThe ACA works incredibly well if you just implement the medicaid expansion, and any state that decides not to do so is just being partisan at the expense of their most vulnerable workers.\n\nSo don't blame the ACA for not giving assistance to people who didn't have it before the ACA and won't have it now because of the state's stubborn refusal to take the federal money.\n\nIt's like complaining that you don't get beer because you won't pitch in for 10% of the cost of the keg, when the party didn't have beer before I bought it. \n\n", "id": "t1_cd6rlpg", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "harddata", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cd62wnw", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428790840, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd6rlpg", "author_flair_text": "[Political Consultant/BA Pol Sci][Center-Left]", "created_utc": "1383601316", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}

Smaller states, poorer states are taking the money because it's an amazing deal. The only reason states are rejecting it is because they're run by Republicans.

If they don't like ObamaCare let them die?\n\nAgain, no. The ACA offers plans for small businesses and individuals. It does not force or encourage states to cancel any benefits to the poor. It does not make Medicaid illegal. It simply prohibits plans that offer caps, and in exchange, offers better plans through healthcare.gov. \n\n&gt; We agree that any state that declines ObamaCare should not get any benefits.\n\nNo, I never stated a personal opinion about states \"should or should not\" get benefits.\n\nI said that the ACA expands Medicaid. Some states have decided not to take the money. As a result, some citizens will face higher premiums when they should have gotten Medicaid. \n\nIt bans sub par healthcare plans. In exchange it offers better plans with subsidies through Healthcare.gov. \n\nAny state that declines Medicaid expansion doesn't get expanded Medicaid. It still gets everything else (subsides, plans through healthcare exchanges).\n\n&gt; I believe that we disagree that Congress may legally control state spending and that it is wise and/or legal to retaliate by cancelling what little the poor now have.\n\nNo. You're misstating the facts. There's no retaliation. If you cancel Medicaid you don't get Medicaid. That's it. The bad healthcare plans being cancelled isn't retaliation. It's a forced upgrade for every state. It's just that some don't offer sub par plans. \n\nTennessee could have created an ACA compliant healthcare exchange. It chose not to, so citizens who'd lose coverage through CoverTN can now buy coverage from Healthcare.gov instead.\n\nSome citizens will lose benefits because they would be covered by the Medicaid expansion, which Tennessee is rejecting.\n\nEveryone else is unaffected. Everyone else gets better plans at better rates.\n\nThe only people who are affected are the people who would qualify for expanded Medicaid but won't get it because Tennessee won't take the money.\n\n&gt; I may misunderstand though, and it seems unlikely that you really support what it seems that you do. \n\nThank you. You're right, I don't support what you implied I did. Because this isn't about personal opinion. This isn't /r/politicaldiscussion. This is a simple question of facts, not opinions. \n\nThere is such a thing as correct information. There is such a thing as facts, even in politics. I stand for facts.

It offers those plans through healthcare.gov if your state decided not to set up an ACA compliant exchange.\n\n**It does not ban existing Medicaid programs for the very poor.**\n\nAll it does is say to states offering private insurance on a state marketplace like CoverTN that they have to offer better health plans. \n\nStates that chose not to offer ACA compliant plans are told they can no longer operate their own markets for those inadequate plans. The federal government is saying that they can offer people better choices. \n\nIf Tennessee wanted to update it's state exchange, like CA and Vermont and Kentucky and many other states did, it could have done that. Instead it said fuck you to the federal government. \n\nSo the ACA says that you can't offer an inferior product through a state exchange that's not ACA compliant. It's just substituting one marketplace for another marketplace, and only because Tennessee didn't want to upgrade it's own marketplace. \n\nIt's that simple.", "id": "t1_cd7uu7m", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "harddata", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cd7uc73", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428772355, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ptp1r", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd7uu7m", "author_flair_text": "[Political Consultant/BA Pol Sci][Center-Left]", "created_utc": "1383714952", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cd7u49a", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1428772590, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1383713884, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ptp1r", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd7uc73", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1383713450", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cd7sy93", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428772692, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd7u49a", "author_flair_text": "[Political Consultant/BA Pol Sci][Center-Left]", "created_utc": "1383712817", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cd7sk9j", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428773237, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1383710023, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ptp1r", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd7sy93", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1383709643", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cd7qx46", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428773418, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ptp1r", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd7sk9j", "author_flair_text": "[Political Consultant/BA Pol Sci][Center-Left]", "created_utc": "1383708661", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cd7qljt", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1428774184, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ptp1r", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd7qx46", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1383704463", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cd7qejx", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428774335, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd7qljt", "author_flair_text": "[Political Consultant/BA Pol Sci][Center-Left]", "created_utc": "1383703664", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}

It still gets everything else (subsides, plans through healthcare exchanges).\n\n&gt; I believe that we disagree that Congress may legally control state spending and that it is wise and/or legal to retaliate by cancelling what little the poor now have.\n\nNo. You're misstating the facts. There's no retaliation. If you cancel Medicaid you don't get Medicaid. That's it. The bad healthcare plans being cancelled isn't retaliation. It's a forced upgrade for every state. It's just that some don't offer sub par plans. \n\nTennessee could have created an ACA compliant healthcare exchange. It chose not to, so citizens who'd lose coverage through CoverTN can now buy coverage from Healthcare.gov instead.\n\nSome citizens will lose benefits because they would be covered by the Medicaid expansion, which Tennessee is rejecting.\n\nEveryone else is unaffected. Everyone else gets better plans at better rates.\n\nThe only people who are affected are the people who would qualify for expanded Medicaid but won't get it because Tennessee won't take the money.\n\n&gt; I may misunderstand though, and it seems unlikely that you really support what it seems that you do. \n\nThank you.

Are you going to say homosexuality is wrong? What about polygamy? We can't even enforce our own bans on polygamy completely. And have you ever considered that the reason people are so \"backward\" is precisely because of where they live and what it's like?

It just so happens that when things are tough and people struggle to survive, they tend to favor autocracies and patriarchies and theocracies because they get shit done. Democracies are for people with time and energy to actually have elections.\n\nSo unless you A. are somehow going to get everyone to agree on what's \"acceptable\" and what's not, B. figure out a way to actually enforce your rules in the most inaccessible regions in the world, and C.  can figure out a way to get everyone to accept a government set up by a racist douchebag who thinks they're inferior monkey-people, then  sure, you can set up a unified world government.

To put this in context, I completed my graduate education in International Relations with a specific focus on American-Canadian security issues.\n\nSnowden's leaks run the risk of weakening American power on the international scene if we accept that power is inclusive of material (guns, warships, tanks etc) and non-material factors (influence, authority etc). The leaks pose a problem because they serve to embarrass the United States in the face of its allies and demonstrate weakness in its internal security processes in what should be some of the most secure institutions of the state. \n\nSo Snowden managed to dent American influence among its allies (even if everyone does spy on one another, it still doesn't look good) and now states that are genuinely interested in weakening American power have cause to believe that they might be able to successfully challenge it in ways not previously possible. Essentially, it's a problem that emboldens potential enemies and makes allies less keen to back American interests.\n\nSo why is a weakened America a problem? The United States has actually successfully maintained international peace through its existence as a world hegemon (especially if you suscribe to [Hegemonic Stability Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemonic_stability_theory)] and a strong America lends economic stability because of its immense consumer base and the fact that the USD is still the reserve currency of the world. So remember, peace through power, stability though power. These are fairly core principles of [realism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_%28international_relations%29). So with the United States' non-material power weakened, it's not able to project itself as effectively as it was once able to do.\n\nNow, let me caveat a bunch of stuff I've just said. The damage is **proportional** - so I'm not saying 'Snowden will cause international chaos'. What I'm suggesting is that his leaks, in the greater scheme of international relations has the *potential* to make life difficult for the United States and its allies. The United States has *a lot* of power to go around, so no one can say what the immediate impact will be. My argument is simply that there is the *potential* for a decrease in non-material power - which negatively impacts the United States and its allies.\n\nAlso, my arguments don't care about internal American politics or law. I don't care if what he did was illegal, or legal, those are inconsequential to my argument. He might be legally justified, he might be ethically/morally justified, and that's fine. But in this analysis, ethics, morals and law mean precisely bunk. Power (in this analysis) is essentially all that matters. What I personally think about the morals/ethics/law of all this is completely separate (but it may or may not be similar) to my analysis of the international implications of his actions.\n\ntl;dr - The leaks hurt American non-material power. No one can quantify how much, or predict the exact impact, but the best argument against his leaks is that the United States plays an integral role in maintaining international peace, and the leaks have the small potential for hurting that peace.\n\nEdit - No acrimony, only intelligent and pleasant conversation.

Realism isn't some monolithic beast that only cares for material power (even if people like Waltz, Mearsheimer, Rose would have it that way). This comes down to the non-material forms of power that the United States draws from to supplement material powers (the nukes, the carriers etc). You'll also notice how careful I was in describing and limiting the impact of the leaks, given the importance of material power and Snowden's negligible impact thereon. \n\n&gt;If you also subscribe to game theory in relation to IR then the \"anti-US\" countries would also know that and act accordingly.\n\nYou don't need to be a game theorist (which I'm not) to draw that particular conclusion. It's obvious on its face that states act according to international power dynamics, which was sort of the point of my analysis. Except I consider non-material factors, not just material ones. \n\n&gt;For example, you could argue that the US/German relationship has been \"damaged\" by the outrage of them spying on Merkel, but according to realist theory the fact they are spying on you is irrelevant, if being a close ally of the US gives you the best possible outcome for your national interest, you're never going to switch to being China's ally no matter how angry you are. \n\nAgain, you're right in the context of game theory. Except my argument wasn't limited to \"You're either an American ally or you're going to switch allegiance.\" Damaged relationships between allies can result in lack of enthusiasm to protect American interests (or to perhaps encourage Germany to share American interests), it doesn't mean they're going to defect. That's rather extreme and my argument was a little more subtle.\n\nSo you're not wrong, but my argument was a little more subtle than maybe game theory is equipped to handle. It's also possibly a product of my education, American scholars of IR tend to favour old school material power analyses and game theory, Canadian/British/Australians have a different flavour of realism (some Canadian programs are American style mind you, just not my graduate program).\n\n", "id": "t1_cd6uibi", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "ThornyPlebeian", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1pwk5w", "selftext": "I'm British so the geography isn't an issue!\n\nI get your argument was that it's all proportional, but really I don't think realism has the tools to deal with that sort of situation. \n\nRealistically the fundamental basis of realism is that countries will always act in their best interest.

At it's heart realism is defined by a few core assumptions, one of which is the importance of national interest. But, national interests are defined by power. If we want to go back to the holy bible of realism, that particular line is present in Hans Morgenthau's *Politics Among Nations* where he says\n\n&gt;The main signpost of political realism is the concept of interest defined in terms of power [Morgenthau, 1948]\n\nWhat I'm getting at here is that you can't separate national interest from power, even non-material power. So American material or non-material power is very relevant when discussing national interests of allies and enemies alike. So if American power (non-material in this case) is dented (even a little) the 'calculations' that go into determining the national interests of its allies (such as Germany) change - even if it's a slight change. So it doesn't imply that there is more at play than national interest, what I'm suggesting is that the interplay between national interest and power is dynamic - which is consistent to realism. \n\nSo when I say that, hypothetically Germany, is less likely to cooperate as keenly with the United States what I'm saying is that Germany's national interests have shifted slightly in response to America's relative power change (even if it's slight).\n\nI hope I'm making sense.", "id": "t1_cd6wcfx", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "ThornyPlebeian", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Can I just say how amazed I am at you two disagreeing with each other and neither of you has a single downvote?

Furthermore, the gaps between the U.S. and other countries in both quantity and quality of military forces have also been shrinking.\n\nAt the same time, a reduction in American political will for overseas operations, reduced spending (both military and non-military), and lowered international opinion of the U.S. (since the start of the Iraq War) have all reduced American capacity to influence the policies of other countries, and reduced their relative power in the international system.

You mentioned the UK, but France has virtually the same military capabilities.  There's also the material power of Germany and Japan, vast potential power from India and Brazil, and an enormous amount of existing power from the PRC and the Russian Federation.  Which of these countries eventually emerge as counters to the U.S., and in what form (U.K. or EU?), I do not know.\n\nMy real issue with your comment is your definition though.  You seem to be taking an extremely \"naval-centric\" view of power.  Just an example of why I disagree wholeheartedly with that view:  if Soviet power had ever extended from the western shores of France to the Korean Peninsula, and from Siberia to the Mediterranean and Southeast Asia, then the country could have been economically and militarily dominant.  Even if they would have been unable to fight in another hemisphere or across an ocean.\n\nThe problem with your definition of unipolarity is that it implies that only great powers like the current U.S. or the former British Empire were \"real\" great powers, and that there is somehow less value in being able to project a million troops a thousand kilometers from your border than there is in being able to send a few hundred thousand troops several thousand kilometers away.  It really depends on the country in question and the geopolitical situation, regardless of how impressive logistically one feat is over another.\n\nThe U.S. is in a unique position since it has no real regional competitors and is isolated from much of the world, so it relies on power projection, but other possible poles of a multipolar system have little to no concern with projecting power in another hemisphere, because most, if not all, of their national interests occur within their own hemisphere, if not their own continent.  The Eurasian landmass is where these countries will be most interested, as well as Africa which is very close by.\n\nAnd honestly, 10 000 troops is not very much, assuming that by \"equipment\" you mean just the troops' equipment, and not tanks or APVs, and you're talking about doing this in just one trip, then I know the PLAN is more or less capable of doing so already.  If we talk about Australia or somewhere else in Oceania, for example, as being that other hemisphere then we can see that, even excluding the PLAN's new aircraft carrier and any future aircraft carriers or amphibious ships, the PLAN's current complement of 3 Type 071 transport docks along with dozens of landing ships (mostly medium or tank and generally capable of carrying 250 fully equipped troops or more depending on variant) could easily ferry 10 000 fully equipped troops in a single trip, and if every amphibious ship was used to its full capacity then they could likely more or less double the 10 000 troop requirement.\n\nI don't know much about other countries' navies, but I doubt that any besides the U.S. and PRC could accomplish this in a single trip as things tand right now, but perhaps the U.K. and France could.  If you're willing to look at more unconventional uses of traditional military hardware (using non-amphibious attack ships for amphibious landings or simple transportation), and allow for multiple trips, then I am confident that we could add some other countries into the mix, probably starting with India or Japan, and maybe including Italy or Spain.  Also, Russia's landing craft and aircraft carrier combined could probably come pretty close to bringing 10 000 troops into southern or central Africa, but they might fall short a couple thousand, I don't really know to be honest.\n\nI really don't think that this is a good gauge of relative material power capabilities, though.

Now, I don't view it as immoral, so much as amoral and we'll have to agree to disagree on it since I'm guessing it largely comes down to philosophical differences.

A lot of realists find ways to justify interventions to prevent human rights atrocities like genocide through other means. For instance, instead of arguing for intervention based on human rights violations, a realist (of most variations) might argue intervention is required to maintain regional stability and local balances of power. The human rights concerns just happen to end up as a happy by-product of maintaining the balance of power/regional stability. Also, the intervening states need some sort of interest in doing so. So if regional stability is in the interest of say, France, the French will intervene (like Mali), if it's not - they won't (like Rwanda). The protection of human rights is incidental to the larger picture.\n\nNow, this doesn't always happen. Rwanda, Darfur and a few other human rights abuses have gone unattended. This only reinforces the idea if no state finds it in their interests to stop genocide, they simply won't. It's terrible, but it sort of goes towards proving that the international system doesn't give two shakes about what is 'right', they care about what's in it for them.\n\nYou might also find it interesting that I'm a gay, Canadian that subscribes to realpolitik in international affairs...

It's not necessarily something I agree with, but it's an argument that I think has legs. It's formulation is by no means perfect or universal, but I think it's a fairly reasonable argument.\n\n1) Ethics and morality largely inconsequential until they intersect with society. That is, we can speculate and argue all we want in a vacuum, and it's fun, and potentially useful to us as people. But, by the definition of this argument, it has very little impact on the lives of real people. In the crudest form: the lives of billions of people are not affected because you read Socrates and decide that Platonic forms are the correct way of thinking about epistemology.\n\n2) The intersection of society and ethics is called the law. Since this is America I'm going to restrict myself to talking about American lawmaking processes. The basis of our system is consent. The social contract conceit explains that government exists to safeguard certain rights in exchange for freedoms guaranteed to us by the \"state of nature.\" In order to best maximize our freedoms and safety, we trust a system of government defined by our Constitution. Broadly, it filters popular and \"reasoned\" opinions into law. This law both mirrors and norms our social values. Therefore, what is legal is good, by force of definition and appeal to the value of our society. So, if you believe that you lead a more comfortable life than not, and that your comfortable life is predicated on the society that you live in, then you value the society we live in.\n\n3) Seeking to preserve that society, we should value, foremost, what is legal and what is not. While we can express distaste or pleasure for certain things not codified or specified by law, generally we should try to constrain ourselves within the boundaries of law if we wish to preserve our society. \n\n4) Applying that framework to Snowden exposes that much of what the NSA does is, within the confines of how our legal system understands itself, legal. The Patriot Act, FISA, etc. all authorize (or at least fail to condemn) the collections that the NSA has conducted. The creation of the FISC, the procedures in the Patriot Act, and the general defense that for the purposes of a search, collected data analyzed by machine is not a search within the meaning of our Constitution, all provide significant legal room for the NSA to operate legally. \n\n5) Hence, the NSA's actions are largely legal. Snowden's actions are, almost without question, illegal. His violation of the law is, under this framework, an unqualified wrong. The disrespect (ie the lack of consent) to the normative and structural power of the law is very dangerous to its power and continuation. Thus it is dangerous to the society that we believe is predicated on that rule of law. \n\n6) One obvious counter-argument makes an appeal to the rule of law as well, though per the terms of this framework it is an illegitimate appeal. The rule of law means what the law says-- not what someone feels privacy or due process, etc. should mean. This includes appeals to alternate theories of legal rationales and defenses for Snowden's actions. In our legal system such arguments are persuasive only if raised in a setting approved by law, i.e. at trial or in the law making process, etc. Otherwise, they are, returning to 1) simply ethical arguments without importance. \n\nA similar argument might be made that Snowden's actions are an appeal to a lawful authority: the will of the people and the democratic process. Such a theory seems appealing, but is inconsistent as it is predicated on an act of disobedience to the law. But, a counter-reply is available. This is where you enter a more disputed area as there is some historical evidence (eg the Civil Rights Era) to suggest that civil disobedience may be part of our lawmaking process. However, civil disobedience historically entailed submission to the punishment of the law. So again, Snowden has failed to act legally, even under this alternative theory. \n\nThat's at least what I've got off the top of my head.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "The answers in here so far are partially right. \n\n* (1) Changing from First Past the Post would make it easier to allow people to vote for 3rd parties without worrying they'll **waste** their vote. But Canada has had multiple parties for years with a FPTP voting system. \n\n* (2) I completely disagree that this would be helpful. Remember, the goal here is a third party, not the third party *you want.* Reforming redistricting would give more control to the middle, but if previous American elections are a guide, new political parties form along the extremes. As a result, you're more likely to get a third party in districts that are very safe for either the Republicans or the Democrats. \n\nIn a far right district, a Tea Party candidate would have a real chance of beating the incumbent Republican. In a far left district, a Green Party candidate could gain enough standing to challenge a more moderate Democrat. \n\n* (3) This really won't have an effect on creating a third party, especially if the smaller districts are drawn more fairly. The more *fair* the district is, the more a center balance will exist, giving more weight to the existing two major parties as logical options in a first past the post system. \n\nSo if changing from FPTP to ranked/range voting isn't a good answer because it'd be incredibly hard to accomplish politically (try explaining to your grandma's friends how range voting works) and redistricting reform and removing the congressional size limit won't help, what will?\n\nSimple. Fix ballot access. The problem is that a qualified 3rd party potential candidate needs a ballot access line. And the way election laws are currently written, even a great candidate can't generally get on the ballot unless he becomes a part of one of the existing parties that have a spot on the ballot in a major election.\n\nEspecially as we move closer to 2014, and the GOP centrists start to push hard against letting Tea Party candidates win primaries, there will be a better and better argument for a tea party candidate to try and win from a 3rd party spot.\n\nThe problem is that unless you change ballot access rules, that candidate won't get on the ballot without gathering an inordinate number of signatures and paying a large fee. In some cases (I'm only partially confident on this part of the answer) you're required to become a member of an existing party or go through the steps to form a new one in advance of the elections (rather than allowing an individual to gain ballot access outside of a party structure). Imagine having to set up an entire party structure just to get one guy on the ballot. \n\nThe nice thing about this change is that it's fairly easily explained to any average voter. You just present the requirements for getting on the ballot as a major party nominee, vs that for a non-major party candidate. Especially when you have a popular 3rd party option, it's a pretty easy argument to say that that candidate is getting royally shafted. \n\nFortunately the rules are changing. California just switched to top two voting system with easier ballot access for non-party candidates. As more states see positive changes in governance (for both sides) from allowing better ballot access, I expect you'll see a gradual shift in that direction, especially when voters can change the law through the initiative process.", "id": "t1_cd4pteo", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "harddata", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cd4lskp", "score": 6, "retrieved_on": 1428895650, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1poy5j", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd4pteo", "author_flair_text": "[Political Consultant/BA Pol Sci][Center-Left]", "created_utc": "1383342934", "ups": 6, "distinguished": null}

If you create more reps, you fix that, and now urban voters have equal, and thus more representatives than they did before.\n\n&gt; 2) It would be more difficult to buy off votes either through corrupt practices or through logrolling. \n\nMembers would need leadership support to become an influential part of the legislative process (to get their bills considered, to build support, to become part of leadership) members would gladly sell their votes to get more power and not be drowned out by all the noise.\n\n&gt; 3) With the decreased practice of logrolling, pork barrel spending would actually decrease.\n\nWhen representatives have less individual power, the leadership controls the process more, so they can put whatever they want in bills and members will just have to swallow it.\n\n&gt; 4) Your representative would be accountable to constituents on a MUCH more local basis, in most cases a suburban town of 30,000 would have a Representative in DC, which means that your local concerns would have a voice!

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ouflo", "selftext": "&gt; I assume you're talking about the healthcare.gov website?  There's a limit to how much testing you can really do for a big project like that.  In a lot of ways, it makes more sense to launch the thing and figure out what needs work when it crashes and burns. \n\nNo. You fuck up like this and some people won't come back (young people who aren't sure they need healthcare) those people are who you need to make the marketplace work. You need quick mass adoption. Insurance doesn't work as well if everyone does a needs test first (because some healthy people will pass)\n\nThis wasn't an Apple Maps failure, because Apple Maps worked 90% of the time (I used it from day 1). Healthcare.gov didn't work at all on day 1. It was a technical cluster fuck of epic proportions.\n\n&gt; Especially for something like helathcare.gov that isn't time sensitive.  (As long as you're signed up by Dec. 15, your plan starts at the same time as everyone else's)\n\nSee my earlier answer. Making it work means getting people on the margins of needing healthcare, not just sick people.\n\n&gt; They could have spent millions of dollars in testing, and shit would have probably still broken.  Instead, they are just fixing it in the field.  Same approach Apple used when they launched Apple Maps knowing that it was incomplete but that people would report inaccuracies.  \n\nNo. No. No. No. No. Apple maps launched. I could get driving directions from day 1. Maybe once in 100 times I got directed to a Jamba Juice in the wrong place, but it was the exception. The only reason it was a big deal is because it was Apple, and people said \"Steve Jobs would never put out something that had flaws\" and it was being compared to Google Maps, which was a finished product with years of development history.\n\nHealthcare.gov didn't work. Journalists couldn't sign up. They all had to interview the same guy during week one because he was the only person they could find who actually signed up. Think about that for a moment. *The launch was so bad that a nation full of journalists couldn't find more than one person who made it work.* That's insane.\n\n&gt; And a google-style soft rollout with \"invites\" or something was politically impossible, even if it would have made sense from a technical standpoint.  People would assume that the gov was hiding something and freaked the fuck out.  \n\nNo. You had thousands of journalists who would report on the launch. The fact that it was limited would be seen as a partial failure but people would forgive. The problem is that it's not a tech launch. It's a government service. Everyone gets it at the same time. It might be the wrong approach but that's how government works. \n\nAnd you can test for this kind of thing. You create software that pretends to be a user. Then you launch 10,000,000 of them at once.\n\nThe government just figured they could build it, get what they thought would be scale. But that's not how you launch a website these days, especially when you know it'll get millions of visitors.\n\nThis was a colossal fuck up and someone high up should get fired. There's no excuse. \n\nSource: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/21/us/insurance-site-seen-needing-weeks-to-fix.html\n\nIf you're down voting my answer, reply and explain why.", "id": "t1_ccw5gbx", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "harddata", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ouflo", "selftext": "&gt; You fuck up like this and some people won't come back\n\nDon't forget that there's an individual mandate and that the exchange is the only place where you can get subsidized plans.  \n\n&gt; You had thousands of journalists who would report on the launch\n\nAnd they would report that they either weren't allowed on or had to track down invites to get on.  \n\n&gt; The fact that it was limited would be seen as a partial failure but people would forgive.\n\nNo, people would see a health care exchange that locks most everyone out and think something shady was going on.

And since we're talking about meanings employed by the average American, I'm avoiding any legal/political dictionaries.\n\nIf you want to, you can exclude the Google Dictionary results because they appear to be tied to Oxford Dictionaries (although I still think accessibility is key to common usage). You might also want to point out that we should be looking to what people actually use in real life rather than dictionaries, but there are two major problems with that:\n\n* If we look to what people use in real life without the aid of dictionaries, you've either got to find a really nice study (I can't find anything on SSRN, JSTOR, or Project MUSE at the moment but maybe I'm entering the wrong search terms; I don't have access to Lexis so maybe you could check that- I'm also a bit database-challenged so maybe I'm looking in the wrong places) or rely on anecdotal evidence. If you want to rely on anecdotal evidence, here's my submission: I've only seen that definition of republic used by two wanna-be pedants so far, though I'll concede I haven't been alive for very long.\n\n* Dictionaries are meant to reflect word usage by the speakers they're attempting to represent. I think a broad cross-section of dictionaries is the best way to represent real-world usage.\n\n\n\n## EDIT: Just saw your other comment.\n\n&gt; In common parlance a republic is a state that does not practice direct democracy but rather has a government indirectly controlled by the people. This understanding of the term was originally developed by James Madison, and notably employed in Federalist Paper No. 10. This meaning was widely adopted early in the history of the United States, including in Noah Webster's dictionary of 1828. It was a novel meaning to the term; representative democracy was not an idea mentioned by Machiavelli and did not exist in the classical republics.\n\nEven this definition couldn't be used to argue that the two are mutually exclusive, seeing as it only mentions a republic as being distinct from a **direct** democracy. Furthermore, the last sentence identifies \"representative democracy\" as a subset or synonym of \"republic,\" so there's no reason to assume that a republic automatically means \"not a democracy.\"\n\nUltimately, you can't just say Boehner's power is justified simply because the US \"isn't a direct democracy\" either, because that doesn't automatically justify every purported check against tyranny of the majority or even demonstrate that the powers accorded to Boehner represent a check against majority rule.", "edited": 1382319304, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ccvxbi7", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1382309887", "ups": 6, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_ccvwv5x", "score": -3, "retrieved_on": 1429047900, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ougkb", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ccvwyo2", "author_flair_text": "[Political Consultant/BA Pol Sci][Center-Left]", "created_utc": "1382308928", "ups": -3, "distinguished": null}

It goes down to $3 under this plan.\n\nMy copay for prescription drugs is $30 or 10%. It's $5 under this plan.\n\nThe other copays:\n\nPrimary Care Visit Copay $3\n\nSpecialty Care Visit Copay $5\n\nUrgent Care Visit Copay $6\n\nGeneric Medication Copay $3\n\nLab Testing Copay $3\n\nX-Ray Copay $5\n\nEmergency Room Copay $25\n\nHigh cost and infrequent services (e.g. Hospital Care) 10%\n\nPreferred brand copay after Drug Deductible (if any) $5\n\nThe entire deductable is $500, which is 500 less than my current insurance. \n\nAnd the best part, I get to switch from Blue Shield back to Blue Cross. I had to leave Blue Cross because I changed jobs. Blue Shield sucks monkey balls in comparison (many doctors don't take it), and amazingly, the Blue Shield plan offered on the exchange is more expensive than Blue Cross. \n\nSo yea, I'm incredibly stoked. This will lower my healthcare costs across the board even if I don't get a dollar in subsidies, and based on how much I make, I know I'll qualify for at least $19 in subsidy to make the monthly premium a break even from what I was paying before. \n\nSo I guess I only have one thing to add:\n\n[Thanks, Obama!](http://themissouritorch.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/thanks-obama-28.gif)", "id": "t1_ccwn38r", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "harddata", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1oxd5l", "selftext": "That's all nice, but considering you wrote this:\n\n&gt;I'm tired of people claiming the ACA will help/hurt them without seeing actual data.

One, the health insurance people who came to our office to explain why they rose so much showed us their cost/profit graphs and outlined several provisions in the ACA that were responsible for it. Two, part of my company's business is explaining ACA changes to small businesses and incorporating those changes into our software package. Costs are going up for all insurance companies and businesses that provide insurance. \n\nIt makes logical sense to me. The ACA requires that insurance companies provide a long list of 'preventative' and other care with no out of pocket expense to the customer. This cost must be offset somewhere. They also require that the insurance company take pre-existing conditions. Those customers can only be a cost to the insurance company and they need to recoup that cost somewhere. The ACA also mandates quite a bit more reporting and compliance for the insurance companies. The cost to implement and comply with it will also be passed down to the customer. \n\nThis also doesn't include the additional cost to the businesses that must somehow comply with all of the rules and regulations in the ACA. We've spent well over 100K re-writing code and advising our clients how to comply with the ACA.

Labor-backed candidates raise money from labor, but that's because when they run they have people in labor saying \"run, we know you're one of us.\" \n\nSame thing with big business. They go to candidates they think can win and say, we like you better than Moe Scumpt over here who will vote against us.

That would also mean everyone would need equal money? How many people do you think would run for president if they knew money was provided for them.\n\nWe have tried these systems in many states. You have to gather signatures to receive funds, and you can't spend any money above a specified limit. The problem is that [voters don't like giving money to politicians.](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Elections) \n\n[In the presidential race, the general election is funded out of federal dollars.](http://www.commoncause.org/site/pp.asp?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&amp;b=1389223) You have to win a major party primary to get that money. \n\nSo we do fund campaigns. You just have to prove you have grassroots support to get the money. \n\n&gt; As much as money in politics sucks, it is a good indication of support and a good way to weed out candidates who probably won't get elected in the first place.\n\nIf they raise the money themselves directly from voters, yes. If it's PAC money, no. If it's self funding, definitely not.\n\n&gt; *A few T.V debates, some travelling and speeches, national platform proposal. That's all it should be IMO. There's no need to fill 30,000 seat arenas and have flamethrower entries.

Try living in Ohio during a presidential election year. You'll be begging to see Billy Mays on your TV after 6 hours of non-stop campaign ads.\n\n&gt; While I too think it has gotten a little ridiculous, campaigns do this because it mobilizes voters and gets them to come out to vote. Without the whole spectacle less people would vote and elections would be more polarized.  \n\nNo. Empirical surveys show that ads do not strongly affect turnout. \n\n\"Even if we attribute all of the possible differences in campaign activity and news coverage between battleground and non-battleground states to advertising \u2013 a move that surely overstates the true impact of advertising \u2013 the effect is essentially 0.7 And this is in spite of a considerable difference in self-reported exposure to advertising (21.2%).

Then the Greeks and the Spanish and the Italians and the Cypriots all turned out to be not great at managing their finances, and the Euro wasn't designed to allow for the kind of market manipulation we can do in the US.\n\n(You can't make the euro worth less to stabilize the economy if other countries also use Euros and they're doing fine. Germany doesn't want you to fix the problem, it just doesn't want you to die on their doorstep)  \n\nSo you can't trust the Europeans, the Russian currency went to shit after the Soviet Union fell apart and a lot of people lost their shirts in the process. Also the Kremlin isn't exactly open about its economic decision making, so there's not a lot of worldwide trust there.\n\nThe Japanese! Wait, they tried to take over the world a while back, so nope.\n\nAnd, well, see my Russian argument when you consider trading in Chinese money.\n\nSo the TLDR is actually simple:\nThere ain't nobody else everybody else can trust. We may be the reckless child, but we're the LEAST reckless of everybody else over the long term.\n\n'MURICA!", "id": "t1_ccsqgxr", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "harddata", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ojz6j", "id": "t1_ccsuqt8", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "workguy", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ojz6j", "selftext": "I'm sorry, but no.

The term \"parliamentary system\" refers to a form of government where a legislative body also controls the executive authority the nation.\n\n&gt;So no, a parliamentary system wouldn't eliminate a division of governing responsibility (you could still have a lower house, an upper house and a president.\n\nThen it's not a parliamentary system.  That is how the US works *now*, what change are you imagining?\n\n&gt;At which point I become confused with your statement about a single unifying leader. How is it we have that and England/France/Germany does not?\n\nOkay first of all: France doesn't have a parliamentary system.  They're a Presidential republic where the elected President actually has *even more power* than the same office in the US.  I actually rather like the French model of government, even just the fact that they have run-off rounds in their presidential elections puts them a step ahead of the US.\n\nThe UK's \"single unifying leader\" is a hereditary monarch, which is a concept offensive to egalitarian principles.  The monarch has also been rendered an effective figurehead over the last couple centuries, so while she may be a national figure, she has no (realized) power to actually push national policies.\n\nGermany's President is appointed by a committee of the Bundestag and the state parliaments, and is therefore not beholden to the German public.  He is also an essentially powerless figurehead.", "id": "t1_ccthbmv", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Lorpius_Prime", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Okay first of all: France doesn't have a parliamentary system.

The prime minister is an appointee of the president but he can be fired by the parliament, forcing the president to serve with someone of a different party then his own. \n \n\"However, when the President's political opponents control parliament, the President's dominance can be severely limited, as he must choose a Prime Minister and cabinet who reflect the majority in parliament, and who will implement the agenda of the parliamentary majority. When parties from opposite ends of the political spectrum control parliament and the presidency, the power-sharing arrangement is known as cohabitation\" Government of France (Wikipedia)\n\n\nThe reason that doesn't happen much anymore is that Presidential and Parliamentary elections happen in the same year, so voters would have to change their minds dramatically in a short period of time. \n\nAlso, where does the \"single unifying leader\" concept come from.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ol4yc", "selftext": "His point is that you said that:\n \n\n&gt; The debt ceiling is structured the way it is because it forces the Congress to stop and think about how much debt we are adding.\n\n\nHis point, and he's right, is that the debt ceiling was not designed to be what it is used for in the modern age, it is simply an iterative outgrowth, a mutation of pre-existing policies. Saying that the debt ceiling was designed for the modern political process is like saying the bone in my nose was designed to hold up my glasses. \n\nNo, the glasses were a modern invention that used my nose as a vehicle to work. The debt ceiling is like my appendix, it serves a purpose, but only because it still exists. It does something, but it doesn't need to be there for the system to work. \n\nAnd the thing is, that's how all policy in Washington works. It's adaptations on top of adaptations. It's the old law or the old policy repurposed to fit a modern goal. \n\n\nThe Electoral College was an excellent system when every state was small and partisanship &amp; the permanent campaign was less pronounced. You simply didn't have red states and blue states because the coalitions changed every 20 years. \n\nSo candidates would have to campaign, mostly through their few surrogates, in every state they wanted to win. (It was tough to visit 13 states during a presidential campaign when railroads didn't exist.)\n\nThe procedural filibuster didn't exist until the modern political era. Politicians in the senate of the 1800s would be horrified to think that their great deliberative body was using tricks to stop the legislative process in its tracks. The point of the senate was to be deliberate, not obstinate. It was to check the unruly behavior of the house, not to limit the lawmaking process from happening at all.\n\nI could go on and on. The interstate commerce clause, the 14th amendment and substantive due process. Tricks are how we make a 200 year old document work for a modern government. \n\nThe debt ceiling is structured the way it is because it was an iterative outgrowth of a policy that began with a security by security debt authorization process.\n\nIt's left over from a switch, from a time when the president managed the budget and congress managed the debt, to a time when the congress manages the budget and the president (through the treasury department), manages the debt. \n\nThere's no point in the congress keeping the debt ceiling, except for the fact that they can't get away with removing it and it still has some modern political use: (it would be political suicide for members to ask for the unlimited power to borrow whatever money they wanted, and also because it serves as a check by the minority party on the majority's control over overall spending).\n\nBut from a policymaking perspective, assuming congress is acting like adults, it makes no sense.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ola03", "selftext": "&gt; That said, here is the basic lowdown. In the Affordable Care Act, there is a provision that grants subsidies to Members, certain administration officials and staff to help them buy health care on the exchanges. This is designed to take the place of employer contributions, because Congress doesn't give those directly to Members or staff.\n\nI'm sorry, I'm going to be a dick, but this is 100% wrong. \n\nWhen the ACA was being passed, Senator Chuck Grassley put in a provision to require the President, VP, the Congress and all their staff to buy healthcare on the exchanges. It did away with the employer provided healthcare that had been the norm. (So congress and their staff previously got their healthcare just like a private businesses' employees)\n\nGrassley essentially made congress the only organization that was prohibited by law from offering employer provided healthcare to their workers. It was done as a political fuck you to the democrats passing the bill, and was never intended to become law.\n\nAnd then a strange thing happened. The democrats accepted the amendment. They said, if a GOP member wants to poison the bill just to fuck over their own staff, okay, be our guests!\n\nNow the initial interpretation was that this meant there would no longer be any healthcare benefits that congress could offer. The president didn't like that interpretation so he created a legal workaround that said that congress could provide a health subsidy equal to the cost of buying insurance on the exchanges. \n\nSo, 1) This workaround was not part of the bill. \nAnd \n2) the provision in the ACA wasn't designed to take the place of contributions congress doesn't offer. It was designed to do away with the healthcare congress explicitly did offer until the ACA was passed. \n\n\nWhat the Vitter Amendment does it take away the president's power to authorize the work around. It says to staff, not only do you have to buy healthcare on the exchanges, but we're not going to give you any money to do it. \n\nIt's a giant fuck you by republicans on top of a pre-existing giant fuck you. \n\nNow, why would they do this to their own staff? Because they needed to make it look like the shutdown was worth doing, and the conservative press made a field day out of Obama's \"special Obamacare exemption for government workers.\"\n\nYes, you read that right. The republicans who made congress the only employer in the country prohibited from offering private insurance to their employees, those same people were now blaming the president for trying to fix their mistake. \n\nSo that's why the republicans wanted it in the bill.

People would obviously work as they have to support themselves, but it would be underground.  What percentage of people would be caught?  Its impossible to know, especially ten years out.\n\nBaseline likewise has its drawbacks - anything on the budget without a sunset provision is assumed to go on forever.

Money is a fungible good and what is described as \"paid for\" depends on how you count the spending.\n\nIf we have $100 and three $50 items - say a men's shirt, a coffee maker and women's shoes  - when we allocate the money for it, and borrow $50 to cover it - what is actually being borrowed to pay for?  Depending if its my wife, she'll say its my shirt.  I'll say its her shoes.\n\nYou have a bit better leg to stand on saying that \"Well, it was the latest thing authorized\" but that's just as valid a stance as saying \"the thing recently authorized as the ones that really need to be paid for first\", the logic there being if something is pressing enough to be created, its the first thing you'd spend money for.\n\nPersonally, I think we need to revamp the tax code to something very simple (no deductions, tiers if needed) but those tiers adjust up and down depending on the budget passed that year relative to some index year.  So if in 2xx1 the rates were 5%/10%/20% and the budget $2 trillion dollars, if in year 2xx2 the budget went up to $2.2 trillion in 2xx1 dollars (as in, adjusted for inflation), the rates would be 5.5%, 11%, 22%.  If in year 2xx5 spending was inflation-adjusted $4 trillion, rates would be 10%/20%/40%.\n\n&gt;The president has already cut the deficit dramatically from his proposed budget. You want him to cut more services to people who need them? To fire federal workers during a recession?\n\nTake a look at the [Historical Tables](http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/historicals) and tell me again about these spending cuts?  And I wouldn't use the word \"dramatically\" when you're still roughly 2x to 50% higher than the average budget deficit from the average deficits from the Bush era.

I assure you,  they aren't always. \n\nLet's take your example about heart surgery and talk about how complicated that is compared to laser eye surgery. First off, you don't just go the doctor and say \"I need heart surgery\". Generally, you start off with symptoms. Let's say they're minor and intermittent, so you're able to wait and go to your primary care doctor. Most likely your primary care will order some basic tests, blood work, EKG and the like, maybe a chest x-ray just to make sure you don't have anything that needs immediate attention. All perfectly reasonable sounding, with a reasonable cost. Most things look okay, but you have a few risk factors (weight, age, family hx, etc) and a few minor EKG changes that may or may not be anything serious. \n\nSo he refers you to the cardiologist.\nYou shop around and find a practice that has reasonable prices for an initial consult and positive recommendations from other patients. So you make an appointment. The cardiologist looks over the information your primary care doctor ordered and then recommends some additional testing, that again, seems reasonable and is competitively priced. After he gets those results, he says he'd like to do a transesophogeal echocardiogram to rule out a valve disorder and evaluate your aorta.\n\nSince you're cost conscious you ask about price and you find out the procedure is more complex than any previous testing you've had and after shopping around you find that the TEE is significantly cheaper at another cardiologists office (it turns out they're affiliated with a same day surgery center, do so this particular procedure, which requires sedation, can be done at a lower cost) but it requires you to have a consult with that doctor prior to the procedure (the cost of the consult is reasonable and will be credited toward the cost of the procedure). The second cardiology office also has good patient reviews but it had a slightly higher initial consult rate which is why you didn't choose it the first time. (Remember, you need the consult to determine what testing you need) Rational  behavior would dictate that you go the cheaper office, so you show up but the doctor you were scheduled to see got held up in the OR, so they set you up with his partner. This cardiologist reviews your record and he's confident the first cardiologist is being too cautious and that you don't actually need a TEE, a regular echocardiogram (which is cheaper by half) will be adequate for diagnosis and he'll be happy to set you up with one. So now you have two conflicting opinions, with drastically different prices. How do know which one is correct? Assume both doctors have made reasonable arguments as to why their recommended course of testing is correct. Do you get a third opinion? Do you trust the internet to give you enough information regarding the diagnostic benefit of either test versus the cost? Do you go back to your first cardiologist and ask if he'll do the regular echo instead? Should he accept the second cardiologists recommendation and order the regular echo even though he feels strongly that you really need the TEE? What if he declines to treat you if you aren't going to agree to his treatment plan? \n\nLet's say that you do go back to your first doctor and he reluctantly agrees to the regular echo. After getting the results, he insists he needs the additional information the TEE provides to make an accurate diagnosis. What do you do now? Do you go back to the second, cheaper, cardiologist? Do you insist on being treated without the more expensive test? Option A) means you would have been better off going with the more expensive test in the first place, Option B) means you risk a wrong diagnosis and a potentially worse outcome. \n\nNotice we haven't even gotten to the heart surgery yet. In this scenario consider that the doctors involved could have many motivations for their recommendations. The first cardiologist makes more money if you get the TEE and the more advanced testing gives him greater protection in a lawsuit. As it turns out, the second cardiologist isn't credentialed to perform TEEs, so he would make more money by reading the regular echo. He's got nothing to lose by recommending it because if it provides all the information needed, great for you. If it doesn't, you'll still need the TEE but at least he got something. When you go back to the first cardiologist, he's now either in a really tough position or a really good one. The tough positon is if he truly believes the TEE is necessary. In that case, he can either drop you as a patient (losing money), or perform the regular echo, knowing it's likely not to be useful and be left wide open to liability if he doesn't have the information he needs and you refuse the TEE. (He'd likely drop you as a patient before risking malpractice). The good position (for him) is if he's more interested in the profit. In that case, he's going to do the regular echo, then try to convince you you need the TEE. If you agree, he's made a killing on you. If you don't, he can still keep treating you (because he's probably okay liability wise) and keep the profits in house when he refers you to his partner, the cardiovascular surgeon. \n\nAlternately, you could have just listened to the first cardiologists recommendation and had him perform the TEE and you'd never know if it was really needed or if the cheaper test would have sufficed. \n\nThe decision whether to have surgery, what type of surgery to have, etc could potentially make the testing dilemma I  outlined look cheap and easy in comparison and you are, again, at a significant disadvantage because the price of a wrong decision could have long term implications for your cardiovascular health.\n \nSo yes, slightly different than a consult exam to determine eligibility (which is usually offered free and is a very simple process), comparison shopping a procedure that has almost zero variability in complexity, has a clear and predictable benefit and will not have an adverse outcome on your health if you choose not to get it.

Since a single payer system isn't really a regulation and more about negotiating prices as a single consumer entity with a massive number of suppliers, I feel like it is a market based system not all that dissimilar from insurance. I mean, health care and the insurance system is pretty divorced from markets for normal goods naturally because it's something that has completely warped incentives and insurance is completely and solely about spreading the cost among a large group of people. Although I suppose my argument might be countered by saying you're forcing people to buy medical care through the payment of taxes. I guess you could make a single payer system that individuals could opt out of before they're 26, and that would be more market friendly (but would have problems in a society that doesn't like people to die from medical ailments because they can't afford care).\n\nAnyway, my point remains that governments can and do use markets to achieve certain goals. In the case of a single payer system, it is still using a medical services market, it just has incredible buying power that would be hard for most in the medical services market to not alter their prices and services in reflection of it and difficult for health insurance companies to offer anything but supplemental services (a market that still seems healthy among medicare recipients).", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ccuoj6l", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1382140846", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_ccugrdl", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1429083669, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1382122674, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ccuhvby", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1382122365", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_ccuez9o", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1429084188, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I guess I see governments as entities that can still operate within a market.

Talk radio and cable news plays to extreme views because that's what gets people to pay attention. People stop listening to you as an entertainment information source if you're boring. \n\nSo media has no reason to try to push you to moderate your beliefs, and politicians don't want to upset the media narrative by saying something that will make them look like a traitor to the cause. \n\nThe result is that voters who work a 40 hour week and get their political views from their friends at work and their friends on TV don't have the mental energy to care that their beliefs might not be based in fact. If they feel good, they must be right. \n\nIt also helps that they have an enemy. Barack Obama's unwillingness to work with (capitulate to) the Tea Party Republicans makes him and everything he stands anathema to them. So if Obama says \"raise the debt ceiling,\" then maybe it's not a good idea to do it.", "id": "t1_ccruj5w", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "harddata", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_ccs03gn", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "metamongoose", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ogtx2", "selftext": "I think that was exactly my point.

This was simply a new service from the White House to emphasize that it was listening to the people.

The federal government shut down the USDA website. It killed the Panda Cam at the National Zoo. It would be hypocritical to keep the petition site up even if it was legal.

Look up Andrew Jackson and the trail of tears for the last time the court tried to stop the president in a somewhat similar situation.\n\nObamacare is actually a good example. The conservative republicans think it is a bad law. States that were asked to enforce it sued the federal government. The Supreme Court was asked to decide if the interstate commerce clause of the constitution gave congress the power to force people to buy health insurance. They decided it did not. \n\nBut since the requirement to buy was enforced by making you pay a special tax, the court found that Congress' power to impose taxes was not as limited. So the court essentially decided the the federal government can force you to buy insurance but only by making you pay a fine if you don't. \n\nIt's unlikely that the people who gave congress the power to tax in 1789 saw it as a way to let the federal government force you to buy a private product. So in that way, the federal government has used the constitution to attempt to extend its power, and the Supreme Court has examined the law to decide if the 200 year old words allow that increase in power. \n\nThe reason it's significant today is that the republicans are using their power to not fund the government or raise the debt ceiling to force the president to accept changes to the law, despite it being legally passed through congress, signed by the president, and upheld by the Supreme Court as constitutional.

Judges tend to stay away from controversies about how congress makes laws because congress is a co-equal branch with the judiciary).\n\nSyria relies on the president's power as commander in chief, and the Supreme Court hasn't tried (recently) to object to that power. Look up Andrew Jackson and the trail of tears for the last time the court tried to stop the president in a somewhat similar situation.\n\nObamacare is actually a good example. The conservative republicans think it is a bad law. States that were asked to enforce it sued the federal government. The Supreme Court was asked to decide if the interstate commerce clause of the constitution gave congress the power to force people to buy health insurance. They decided it did not. \n\nBut since the requirement to buy was enforced by making you pay a special tax, the court found that Congress' power to impose taxes was not as limited. So the court essentially decided the the federal government can force you to buy insurance but only by making you pay a fine if you don't. \n\nIt's unlikely that the people who gave congress the power to tax in 1789 saw it as a way to let the federal government force you to buy a private product. So in that way, the federal government has used the constitution to attempt to extend its power, and the Supreme Court has examined the law to decide if the 200 year old words allow that increase in power. \n\nThe reason it's significant today is that the republicans are using their power to not fund the government or raise the debt ceiling to force the president to accept changes to the law, despite it being legally passed through congress, signed by the president, and upheld by the Supreme Court as constitutional.
