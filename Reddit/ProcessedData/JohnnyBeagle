This is the type of situation that brought about the American labor movement, because the situation is intolerable to any person.\n\nSo... best option? Maybe.

Apparently people disagreed with that.\n\nBut let's address OP's question, then. Many of these companies, whether it's Apple producing iPhones and iPads in China or Hanes producing t-shirts in Haiti, make a significant profit, enough that they could afford to increase the wage they pay their workers. Hanes, for example:\n\n&gt; Haiti has about 25,000 garment workers. If you paid each of them $2 a day more, it would cost their employers $50,000 per working day, or about $12.5 million a year ... As of last year Hanes had 3,200 Haitians making t-shirts for it. Paying each of them two bucks a day more would cost it about $1.6 million a year. Hanesbrands Incorporated made $211 million on $4.3 billion in sales last year.\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/wikileaks-haiti-minimum-wage-the-nation-2011-6\n\nNow, Haiti could increase their minimum wage, but they run the risk of losing the small amount of business they already have. In contrast, the United States and other Western nations could establish standards that they refuse to import goods that are produced under conditions such as these. In response, companies would have no other option but to take the hit on their bottom line, or raise their prices for Western consumers, and that would effectively raise the quality of life of workers throughout the third world.\n\nI would be willing to bet it would be almost universally beneficial for Western nations to establish these standards. If foreign companies wanted access to Western markets, they would need to meet those standards.\n\nAdmittedly there are other issues with this, for instance it could be seen as elitist because certain Americans maybe \"rely\" on cheaper goods, however when it comes to the amount of relieved suffering worldwide I don't think there is any comparison.", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sanemaniac", "id": "t1_cewhobn", "parent_id": "t1_cewheql", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1432064240, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cewhobn", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1390443833", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "FacelessBureaucrat", "id": "t1_cewheql", "parent_id": "t1_cewh9q2", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1432064103, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; Because it is their best option does not mean that it is a good option.\n \nThat's not the question.

But, the War Labor Board ruled that those wage controls did not apply to fringe benefits like health insurance. Vehicle insurance didn't become popular until the 60s and 70s when states started passing laws making it compulsory, and only about 50-60% of the population owned their own homes (compared to 100% of people who need a doctor from time to time). Therefore, as a means for employers to attract more and better workers during the war, health insurance was the best option. \n\nWorkers could have tried to negotiate for HO and auto insurance benefits later on, but they didn't because they had other priorities. Auto insurance and homeowners insurance are far more affordable than health insurance, which means it's a lesser need and a lower priority for workers. Even if they could theoretically get better coverage at a lower rate by taking advantage of an employer's group rate, the difference wouldn't be nearly as noticeable. Whereas most people need to visit the doctor multiple times per year and incur medical costs very regularly, they really only need to rely on auto or homeowners insurance in the event of a rare emergency -- personally, I think I've filed one car insurance claim in my entire life, and I can afford the premiums very easily. Therefore, when workers go to negotiate with employers, they have much bigger priorities than these other types of insurance.\n\nThe reason the *government* wants employers to provide health insurance is because we've decided that hospitals shouldn't throw people out on the streets to die just because they can't afford medical treatment. But to keep health care providers from incurring huge expenses for treating such patients, the government pays them to help cover some of the costs. Therefore, it is in the government's (and taxpayers') best interest to make sure everyone has health insurance so the government doesn't have to pay for their ER visits. However, e have no similar law that says people are entitled to home or car repairs even if they can't afford them, so the government doesn't stand to gain or lose money like they do with health insurance.", "id": "t1_cci66ep", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Doctor_Worm", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "There was also big changes in medical care after the advancements made during two world wars.
