You're forgetting the monumental cost of shipping the materials and the product halfway around the world, and the huge losses the companies suffer when cheap knockoffs are created using American specs. \n\nWhat sounds more efficient? Manufacturing iPhones, for example, in America, then putting them on trucks to be sold in America (the primary market) or making iPhones in China, putting them on ships, sailing them 10,000 miles, offloading them, running them through Customs, shipping them to a distribution center, and then putting them on trucks to be sold in America? Why is it cheaper to do the latter instead of the former? Because we're not ensuring that companies have incentive to conduct domestic operations. That's why.

Your thinking is only one layer deep!", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Did what?\n\nCompared \"sweat shops\" to \"slave labor.\"\n\n&gt; You're the one putting my words in boxes you've constructed.\n\nI am not. If you don't want to sound xenophobic, quit being xenophobic.\n\n&gt; We need manufacturing jobs here.\n\nWe need efficient, competitive jobs here. If you can make iPhones cheaper than they can in China, roll 'em out.\n\nThat is why the Chinese are making iPhones and Americans are not. It is not because of anything the government did or failed to do. It is because they are doing it more efficiently. And this is good. It is good for Americans to have access to less expensive goods. It is good for the Chinese to have jobs making these goods. Everyone's a winner with trade.\n\n&gt; But what about when we go to war with China in the next 50 years? What then?\n\nFor someone who doesn't give a fuck about the Chinese, you seem to give an awful lot of fucks about the Chinese.\n\nIn any event, countries that trade with each other don't go to war. It's bad for business.\n\n&gt; Did you ever think that a robust middle class might be better able to afford domestically manufactured products?\n\nThis isn't true. When computers were made in America, very few could afford them. Now computers are made in China and everyone has one. Even the guy who got laid off at the manufacturing plant has one.

Funny things, commas. \n\n&gt;xenophobic\n\nWhy are you race-baiting? Stop that. I don't care about the ethnicity of the people with the jobs. I care about American workers and American manufacturing self-sufficiency. We need to have the capacity to manufacture the things we want and need domestically, or whoever does it for us has a geopolitical Sword of Damacles to hang over our heads.\n\n&gt;We need efficient, competitive jobs here.\n\nNot false. But you're ignoring the fact that manufacturing jobs *can* be efficient and competitive. First thing's first though, companies need a reason to keep the jobs here. You're forgetting the monumental cost of shipping the materials and the product halfway around the world, and the huge losses the companies suffer when cheap knockoffs are created using American specs. \n\nWhat sounds more efficient? Manufacturing iPhones, for example, in America, then putting them on trucks to be sold in America (the primary market) or making iPhones in China, putting them on ships, sailing them 10,000 miles, offloading them, running them through Customs, shipping them to a distribution center, and then putting them on trucks to be sold in America? Why is it cheaper to do the latter instead of the former? Because we're not ensuring that companies have incentive to conduct domestic operations. That's why. How in the world would it be bad for the economy to have a higher volume of domestic manufacturing? So people have to pay $25 more for an iPhone. So what? Think what they're already charging. It's a drop in the bucket and we get more jobs out of it.\n\n&gt;For someone who doesn't give a fuck about the Chinese, you seem to give an awful lot of fucks about the Chinese.\n\nThey're not our friends, they're our competition. There are no friendships in business. There's profit and there's loss. Period. \n\n&gt;In any event, countries that trade with each other don't go to war. It's bad for business.\n\nWar is bad for business. Unless you're in the defense industry. But if your rule were true, there would have never been any wars ever. International trade is not a new thing. And there have been plenty of wars between major trading powers. \n\n&gt;When computers were made in America, very few could afford them.\n\nCitations needed.\n\n&gt;Now computers are made in China and everyone has one.\n\nCitation needed.\n\n&gt;Even the guy who got laid off at the manufacturing plant has one.\n\nCitation needed.\n\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; No, what I said was \"slave labor, sweat shops, and child labor\"... three separate things.\n\nThree things that you are trying to get people to equate. I'm just reading what you wrote.\n\n&gt; I don't care about the ethnicity of the people with the jobs.\n\nYou seem to care very much that they are not Americans. That's xenophobia. It's not racism, but it is xenophobia. This is textbook shit.\n\n&gt; We need to have the capacity to manufacture the things we want and need domestically\n\nDivision of labor, how does it work?\n\n&gt; But you're ignoring the fact that manufacturing jobs can be efficient and competitive.\n\nDo it then. Roll 'em out.\n\n&gt; What sounds more efficient? \n\nLetting the Chinese do it, obviously. That's why they're doing it.\n\n&gt; we're not ensuring that companies have incentive to conduct domestic operations.\n\nThat's not what trade barriers are. They are not incentives, they are *disincentives.* They make things artificially more expensive or harder to obtain. They are a tacit admission that your way of doing things is inefficient and uncompetitive. If it were not so, no trade barriers would be necessary.\n\n&gt; How in the world would it be bad for the economy to have a higher volume of domestic manufacturing? So people have to pay $25 more for an iPhone. So what?\n\nYou can't be serious. You just explained how it would be bad, then shrugged it off. You're just suggesting the same old tired protectionism. You want everyone to pay more for everything so some people can make more money, and presto, prosperity! But that is not how the math works.\n\n&gt; They're not our friends, they're our competition.\n\nCompete, then.\n\n&gt; International trade is not a new thing. And there have been plenty of wars between major trading powers. \n\nAnd nearly 100% of the time they are precipitated by embargoes, protectionism, and trade wars. See the United States' commercial relationship with Japan during the runup to WWII.\n\n&gt;&gt; When computers were made in America, very few could afford them.\n\n&gt; Citations needed.\n\n&gt;&gt; Now computers are made in China and everyone has one.\n\n&gt; Citation needed.\n\n&gt;&gt; Even the guy who got laid off at the manufacturing plant has one.\n\n&gt; Citation needed.\n\nAre you fucking kidding?", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Three things that you are trying to get people to equate.\n\nAccording to the assumptions you made based on reading into what I said.

Okie dokie.\n\n&gt;Division of labor, how does it work?\n\nApparently it only works through unfettered globalization. Right?\n\n&gt;That's not what trade barriers are. They are not incentives, they are disincentives. They make things artificially more expensive or harder to obtain. They are a tacit admission that your way of doing things is inefficient and uncompetitive. If it were not so, no trade barriers would be necessary.\n\nDo you not understand what cost of living is? Things are more expensive to manufacture in America because it costs more to live here. Are you saying that we should have no manufacturing capacity because we don't want 85% of the population to live in rice paddies and smog-choked urban slums with a sub-plebian standard of living? That's fine logic. \n\n&gt;You can't be serious. You just explained how it would be bad, then shrugged it off. You're just suggesting the same old tired protectionism. You want everyone to pay more for everything so some people can make more money, and presto, prosperity! But that is not how the math works.\n\nI get it. You're one of those \"free-market\" worshippers. If it's good for the CEOs and the Executives, it's good for everyone because everyone would be a CEO or an Executive if only they'd quit voting for Obama. Right? I mean, honestly, who cares if America becomes a stagnant third-world slum as long as goods are being manufactured *somewhere* for the cheapest possible overhead? Right? \n\nAnd don't you see that power and wealth accrue to the influential? Zero regulation doesn't lead to prosperity. It leads to oligarchy and tribalism. Libertarianism is a bullshit philosophy that leads to anarchy and division. Why is it good for America for the Chinese to have jobs that Americans could have? Is double-digit unemployment and an end to manufacturing independence really worth a 5% discount on the price of goods?", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1vuvsy", "selftext": "&gt; So... it's xenophobic to want Americans to be employed?\n\nWhen it is quite plainly at the expense of foreigners who have wronged you in no way, yes, that is emphatically xenophobic.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Yeah, yeah. Ron Paul.\n\nIt's true though. I went to caucus last year for the first time in my life, I'm 32, I've never identified as a Republican or voted for a Republican, didn't know shit about the process, just knew that \"if you support Ron Paul, go to this caucus, vote for him in the straw poll, and if you're feeling real froggy stand to be a delegate to your district convention.\"\n\nSo that's what I did. I thought that would be the end of it, like I'd cast my vote, stand to be a delegate, get shot down because what kind of Republicans would vote for this crazy longhaired loudmouth, and then I'd maybe flip 'em the bird and go get a beer.\n\ntl;dr - I lost control of my life at that exact moment. I wound up being a delegate to my district convention and the state convention and now, a year and a half later, I stood for and was elected as a ward chairman for the city Republican party and a senate district chairman for the state party.\n\nNot glamorous. Mostly work. There are few cigars, and almost no blowjobs. My job is to organize my district, identify and contact likely voters, take the lead in finding candidates for city offices in my ward and state senate in my district, chair meetings, all kinds of unglamorous crap. But it's important, it's work that needs doing, it gives me a chance to have a real and immediate effect on the future of the party on the local level, and doing the work gets you street cred. Even beyond my immediate sphere of influence (the ward, the district, the city at large), this longhaired loudmouth libertarian gets listened to and respected, because I do the work and people recognize that I don't fuck around. A political party's a big beast to steer, but I do have real influence in that process, even if it's just one small piece, one vote, one guy talking.\n\nThis isn't just me sucking my own dick here, I've got a point to make, and here it is:\n\nDo the work. There's no shortage of people willing to sit around and drink beer and bitch about shit, but there's never enough people willing to do the work. Update the spreadsheet. Make the phone calls. Set up the chairs in the community center. All that crap. Do the work.\n\nWhile you're doing the work, you will meet all kinds of people who are also doing work. Your two jobs are to soak up every fucking scrap of information you possibly can from them because they know the process and they know the work and you don't, and to gain their respect through doing the work, especially the shit work. I can say that from both sides now, because I've been the guy willing to work, and now I'm the guy who's really fucking short on people willing to work and I could use the help.\n\nWhatever your ultimate goal is, it starts with shit work and spreadsheets. Whether you're trying to get a law changed, someone elected, yourself elected, no one's going to listen to a damn thing you have to say (and they shouldn't, who the fuck are you?) unless you build a reputation for yourself.\n\nThat doesn't need to be party-based at all, that's just the example I've got to work with. Maybe it's a community organization like /u/Putr said. Maybe one exists, maybe not. If so, find out what they need and do it. If not...ha! More work, sucker.\n\nBut you sound passionate about municipal-level stuff, so I'd really very strongly recommend starting with whatever neighborhood associations or community organizations exist, whether they're oriented toward the issues you're passionate about or not. Why? Because that's where you will find the people who are doing the work and if you let them they will tell you where to go, what to do, who to talk to. If you're electorally oriented and there's a party you identify with, find out what their lowest level of organization is in your area, find out when they meet, and go there. Meet people. Listen. Shut the fuck up. Find out what they do.\n\nWherever you go, here's a protip: **Help put away the chairs.** That's how I got started.", "id": "t1_cd57r06", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "buffalo_pete", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cd58323", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Leciant_Cruz", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Good, I hope so!

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I'm going to take a somewhat different angle than most of the other people who've posted. First, I need to explain how prices work. Why is it that wherever you go, a loaf of generic grocery store bread is about the same price? It always has a little bit of swing in it depending on the time or place, but you can always pretty much guess what it's gonna cost before you go to the store (*any* store, which is important). Why is this? And why the hell is this relevant?\n\nBecause of the price mechanism; because millions and millions of people every single day decide how much money they're willing to spend on bread, and thousands and thousands of bakeries decide how much they're willing to take for bread. It's amazing to think about, but all those millions and millions of individual choices \"set the price\" for the loaf of bread in your cupboard, and the aggregate of all those decisions comes up with a \"just\" price, a price you were willing to spend and a price the supermarket was willing to take. I don't know about you, but I think that's incredible.\n\nSo to answer the question, a price is an aggregate of innumerable individual valuations. And in fact, it *must* be so, in order for it to work.\n\nBack to health care. Presently, the United States government pays for around half of all the health care consumed in this country, mostly through Medicare. This gives the government a monopsony power over the price of health care. (Monopsony is the opposite of monopoly; it means \"single buyer\" rather than \"single seller.\") This breaks the price mechanism. Markets work best when there are as many buyers and sellers as possible; the aggregates of all their choices \"set prices,\" remember?\n\nSo the market for health care is already distorted, before we even begin to discuss the ACA. But the ACA, through the exchanges, new regulations on minimum coverage and the like, and dozens and dozens of other means, further restricts and distorts the buying and selling of health care and health insurance, as well as expanding the government's harmful monopsony power.", "id": "t1_ccu71aw", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "buffalo_pete", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ooq6p", "id": "t1_ccubxdc", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Cleverpenguins", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_ccueqcl", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_ccubxdc", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429085134, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; Do the republicans want to get rid of all forms of government sponsored health programs in favor of private competition?\n\nIt's not exactly clear what the Republicans want to replace the ACA with, but I think the principal objection is to the insurance mandate.

The tactic entails cutting the most visible or appreciated service provided by the government, from popular services such as national parks and libraries to valued public employees such as teachers and firefighters. This is done to gain support for tax increases that the public would otherwise be against.

The head of the German audit court said that [\"a compromise was reached,\"](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-25/new-york-fed-to-help-bundesbank-meet-gold-audit-requirements.html) whatever that means.

The head of the German audit court said that [\"a compromise was reached,\"](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-25/new-york-fed-to-help-bundesbank-meet-gold-audit-requirements.html) whatever that means.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1dkxlr", "selftext": "&gt; do you honestly believe that?\n\nAbsolutely. In California and New York, they are indeed coming for people's guns. It is happening. And if Feinstein thought for one minute that she could get away with it, yes, without a doubt I have no trouble believing that. To imagine that the real goal is just to do away with \"100-round magazines and assault rifles\" that pretty much no one owns anyways and are never used in any sort of violent crime is absurd.\n\n&gt;  At most they're trying to come for your 100-round magazines and assault rifles.\n\nLeaving aside my qualification above... Maybe you think that makes it more okay that they're just coming for \"scary guns.\" I don't. The second amendment ends with \"shall not be infringed,\" not \"except for the big scary looking ones.\"\n\nWe already tried an \"assault weapons\" ban in the 1990s, and it was a worthless failure. Why? Because no one's gonna mug you or hold up your gas station with a rifle. It's ridiculous.\n\n&gt; I'd love to have a rational gun discussion\n\nCool, I'll start. [Get a load of this gif.](http://www.gun-nuttery.com/rtc.gif) It tracks changes in state gun restrictions since the late 1980s.\n\nEach state turning blue represents a state that passed \"shall issue\" carry laws. Every state that turns green is a \"don't even need to ask permission if you arn't a felon\" state. Every time one of those states turn green or blue, that is several million ordinary people who start to carry a firearm daily.\n\nAlso, in every single state crime has gone down. Every single one. Nationwide, since the peak in 1991, we've cut the violent crime rate, including criminal homicide, in half. **Half!**\n\nThis is why the gun grabbers have lost. This is why they tried to go for background checks and so-called \"assault weapons\" instead of trying to ban handguns. They tried, and they lost there too, because people aren't stupid. This is why, rather than have a rational discussion, which they *refuse* to do, they hold up pictures of scary looking rifles with scopes on them and expect America to piss its collective pants.\n\nI too would love to have a rational gun discussion.

To imagine that the real goal is just to do away with \"100-round magazines and assault rifles\" that pretty much no one owns anyways and are never used in any sort of violent crime is absurd.\n\n&gt;  At most they're trying to come for your 100-round magazines and assault rifles.\n\nLeaving aside my qualification above... Maybe you think that makes it more okay that they're just coming for \"scary guns.\" I don't. The second amendment ends with \"shall not be infringed,\" not \"except for the big scary looking ones.\"\n\nWe already tried an \"assault weapons\" ban in the 1990s, and it was a worthless failure. Why? Because no one's gonna mug you or hold up your gas station with a rifle. It's ridiculous.\n\n&gt; I'd love to have a rational gun discussion\n\nCool, I'll start. [Get a load of this gif.](http://www.gun-nuttery.com/rtc.gif) It tracks changes in state gun restrictions since the late 1980s.\n\nEach state turning blue represents a state that passed \"shall issue\" carry laws. Every state that turns green is a \"don't even need to ask permission if you arn't a felon\" state. Every time one of those states turn green or blue, that is several million ordinary people who start to carry a firearm daily.\n\nAlso, in every single state crime has gone down. Every single one. Nationwide, since the peak in 1991, we've cut the violent crime rate, including criminal homicide, in half. **Half!**\n\nThis is why the gun grabbers have lost.

Note that Obama didn't pull any Reagenesque assassinate Khadafi bullshit, but a controlled intelligent campaign: less CIA more liberalism there.\n\nPresidents make decisions as commanders-in-chief. However, the data for these decisions is selectively provided by a massive intelligence apparatus which answers mostly to itself and has numerous demands and right-violations which never see the desk of a president. \n\nThe CIA informs an American president of what they need and the president accommodates, unless the demands are blatantly in violation of the law (in this case, they are not, the Patriot act is the rule of the land). If you blame Obama for it, you are treating him as an exception, when Obama is merely a traditional American president.

Hell, it wouldn't be far from the current conservative discourse. \n\nPoint 2: Drones directly remove danger from American lives. This is not some high handed metaphor: it is pragmatism. A drone delivers a weapon without risking the operator of the weapon. A drone can be operated from a mobile naval platform, meaning that most contemporary enemies would have little or no way of reaching it.

First, although Comcast often has monopoly status in the areas it operates in, it is by no means \"unregulated.\" The reason they *are* a monopoly in some places is because they're granted sole carrier status by those municipalities. There's no reason I know of why a cable company should be any kind of \"natural monopoly.\"\n\nThat ties in with my second thought, which is that the (ostensible) reason for such sole carrier agreements is the problem of access for underground cable, which is certainly not comparable with an industry like over-the-road delivery, where anyone with a car has access to the infrastructure. The barrier to entry is about as low as any you could come up with.\n\nTo touch on the \"capital intensiveness\" part of your comment, I don't think that necessarily has to be true. You seem to be assuming that one monolithic company would handle mail delivery, where I don't think that would be the case at all. Think about power delivery, and how different companies (and even private citizens) pay each other for power and the right to use each others' lines. I think you'd see something much more akin to this model in a privatized mail delivery system.\n\nHistorically speaking, when allowed to be, mail and package delivery has always been a highly competitive industry, and I don't see any reason why that would cease to be the case.\n\nOne last thing...\n\n&gt; I think junk mail should be either illegal or very costly to send.\n\nWell then, unfortunately the verdict is pretty clearly in: You just don't get to have a US Postal Service that isn't funded in very large part by junk mail. Their revenue model would absolutely not accommodate that.

What American values or ideas does the Progressive Era represent, especially those that are so vehemently despised by the right? and what's uniquely liberal about them?\n\nI think in time the progressive era will, but if the Dems wanted to use it they have to do a better job of associating core American values and ideas with it. \n\ni think my whole original statment is that the repubs have worked the idea of a narrative to get indoctrinated Americans to buy into ideas that are quite frankly against their own best interest (and to an increasingly large degree against the interest of America as a nation), in a way you can't say for the Dems.  without a real narrative of some sort, its still true that it's a republican thing as opposed to a \"everybody does it\" thing.\n\nThe best proof that this exists the way im saying it is looking at the struggles of the Republicans in the last election cycle.  They trotted out their narrative yet again, but this time they couldn't get enough people to buy it to get them elected.  As demographics shift, less people are going to buy the narrative that underlies their party and they'll continue to lose. \n\ni'm interested in a response about what values we believe the progressive era represent, but more importantly which of those values parts of our country are against...

Here we go.\n\nImmigrants came to Ellis Island to escape from poverty and tyranny and build a better life for their children, but they were faced with a *new* tyranny, perpetuated by capitalist robber barons and embodied in filthy tenements and exploitative working conditions.

The 2nd can also be said to be primarily against armed insurrection or foreign invasion, but we are talking about a 200 year old document written in very different times. As the time changes, we must re-evaluate our values and laws as a democratic society. Unfortunately, many people on the anti-gun control side refuse to have an actual debate and don't even entertain the notion of moderate gun control. \n\nThere is no logical reason for the government to switch to the dystopian picture you painted, no reason.

It is a VERY important subject ethically speaking.\n\nThe only valid non-religious arguments against abortion are likely to be based in effectively equating an embryo, fetus, etc. as a human life, or something close to it. Thus, it is important to examine *very closely* the term \"life.\" WhirledWind uses the term \"life\" in two different sentences above, and in each sentence the term life has very different meanings.\n\nFirst sentence, \"life\" means that of an \"individual organism,\" or so he says. What is revealed is a stark misrepresentation of what happens at conception. There is an ovum (egg cell) that is fertilized. The fertilized egg has human DNA and is set on a course to potentially develop into a full-blown human being. But somehow, magically, this is when \"life\" begins for an \"individual organism.\" You can argue every single cell in your body is an \"individual organism\" by this logic, as objectively there is very little distinction to be made between the fertilized cell and any other cell in your body.\n\nSecond sentence, \"life\" seems to be referred to a in a legal sense, and the only reason such \"life\" should be under the jurisdiction of law, vis-\u00e0-vis abortion specifically, is if it were considered \"human life.\"\n\nChibano calls out these clumsy renditions with good reason. I followed suit. Taken to its logical end, the notion that any cell containing human DNA is human life with full ethical implications leads us to be carrying out abortions whenever we type, bite our lip, or shed a hair.\n\nIf they were explaining the biological definition of \"life,\" they were failing miserably.
