Madison.\n\nIs a gross simplification of what happened, to the point of being inaccurate and accurate at the same time. The Marbury v. Madison case is a topic in and of itself, but what is relevant to this discussion is the Supreme Court has judicial review powers with over 200 years of legal prescient. No matter what you opinion on the matter, the legal fact is they do have the authority.\n\n&gt; What is the point of Section 5?\n\nThe point of section 5 of the 14th Amendment is to give congress the authority to make and change the laws that pertain to the Amendment. Section 4 of the 14th amendment (referring to the validity of Public debt) will require regular new laws from congress to address an ever changing economic environment. If the 14th amendment spelled out exactly how the Public debt had to be paid, it would have to be changed over and over again (though new constitutional amendments) as economic factors changed. Section 5 gave the congress the ability to make the specifics of how this is done to simplify to process and make ease of updating. \n\nAlso remember that section 5 of the 14th Amendment *only* applies to the 14th Amendment. It does not extend to any other laws.\n\n&gt; May Congress pass a law reversing a SCOTUS decision (as authorized in Section 5)?\n\nThis is actually a complex issue. The Supreme Court rules on the constitutionality of laws. Congress can pass laws that can then come up for judicial review. So depending on the reason why the Supreme Court ruled the way they did, in some situations Congress could change the affects of a Supreme Court ruling after the fact. In other situations the new law would fall by the same constitutional challenge of the previous law. \n\n&gt; May Congress determine that an abortion denies the fetus a right to life\" and so reverse Roe v. Wade?\n\nCould congress pass this law? Yes. It would then go to the Supreme Court and they would rule on the issue. It would almost certainly strike the down as unconstitutional citing the ruling in Roe v Wade. \n\nSo in conclusion, Congress can pass any law they want, and the Supreme Court can rule on cases however they want.

It lays down limits on the powers of the crown and sets out the rights of Parliament and rules for freedom of speech in Parliament, the requirement for regular elections to Parliament and the right to petition the monarch without fear of retribution. It reestablished the liberty of Protestants to have arms for their defence within the rule of law, and condemned James II of England for \"causing several good subjects being Protestants to be disarmed at the same time when papists were both armed and employed contrary to law\".\n\n---\n\n[^(**Picture**)](http://i.imgur.com/mZBu8Jz.png)\n\n[^(image source)](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Coat_of_Arms_of_England_\\(1689-1694\\).svg) ^| [^(about)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| *^(/u/RomanNumeralVI can reply with 'delete'.

It is possible for a person who is a slight conservative (and identifies as such) to vote for the more liberal of two candidates if its a choice between a moderate liberal and a hard-liner conservative.  \n\n3)  Moderates in recent years tend to break towards liberal candidates.  While the margin of the liberal/conservative split is smaller percentagewise that the party identification split, bear in mind the moderate/undecided group is significantly larger, as large as the conservative and liberal groups combined.  A 5 point split among moderates might bet the same as a 10 point direct party identification split.\n\n4) Individual candidates matter.

That's a pretty important distinction. \"Liberal\" has a somewhat pejorative connotation in modern political discourse due a loosely conducted campaign by Republican/conservative pundits and politicians over the past 50 years to make it a dirty word (see commonly utilized phrases such as \"tax and spend liberal,\" \"limousine liberal,\" \"bleeding heart liberal,\" etc. and their constant portrayal of liberals as \"coastal elites,\" \"ivory tower academics\" and effeminate Europhiles who sip lattes and drive hybrids). Conservatives really have won the rhetoric war - among Republicans, it's a pissing match between who is the most \"conservative\" during primary elections. You don't really see that kind of pissing match among Democrats, who generally prefer to identify as \"centrist,\" \"moderate,\" \"progressive,\" etc. \n\nConsider what JFK famously said about being a liberal:\n\n&gt;\u201cIf by a \"Liberal\" they mean someone who looks ahead and not behind, someone who welcomes new ideas without rigid reactions, someone who cares about the welfare of the people-their health, their housing, their schools, their jobs, their civil rights and their civil liberties-someone who believes we can break through the stalemate and suspicions that grip us in our policies abroad, if that is what they mean by a \"Liberal\", then I'm proud to say I'm a \"Liberal.\u201d\n\nNow compare that to one of Obama's most famous quotes:\n\n&gt;\"There is not a liberal America and a conservative America - there is the United States of America. There is not a black America and a white America and a Latino America and an Asian America - there's the United States of America.\"\n\nNow, I'm sure he has self-identified as a \"liberal\" at some point, but not in the way that JFK did with such strong words. Though I have my reservations about calling Obama a \"liberal\" as he has maintained so many of the status quo, neoconservative and corporatist policies of his predecessors, I think most people in the country would say that he is a \"liberal.\" And clearly, people voted overwhelmingly for him - twice. \n\nMy point is: a lot of people in this country are going to call themselves \"moderates\" because it's less offensive, it makes them seem less ideological and more open-minded, it's ambiguous, it doesn't carry the connotations that \"conservative\" or \"liberal\" have, and most importantly, it allows them to not have to pick a side in what is a politically divided country. But while they identify as moderates, their voting behavior suggests otherwise.     \n\nAnd yet there is hardly a consensus on what it means to be a \"liberal\" in modern day America. Most people presumably consider Obama to be a liberal - but is he really a \"liberal\" in the same way that Noam Chomsky, Ralph Nader, and Dennis Kucinich are? \n\nTo put it another way - according to most Republicans, \"liberals\" control the Executive Branch and the Senate. But as I mentioned earlier, are the Democrats in power really doing anything to change or reform the status quo (which, in its simplest definition, is the goal of liberalism)? \n\n**TL;DR: Liberal is a dirty word in American politics. There is no agreed upon definition for what a liberal is. Its definition is dependent on the context in which it's used. Most politicians who are considered \"liberal\" probably wouldn't call themselves \"liberal\" - same goes for the people who vote for them.**", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cemrmli", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1389420004", "distinguished": null, "ups": 20}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1uxwbg", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Euronomus", "id": "t1_cemrtzh", "parent_id": "t3_1uxwbg", "score": 5, "retrieved_on": 1431893755, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Because there's almost no such thing as a moderate Republican anymore.

The exchange offers subsidies toward lowering premium costs, but some people may not qualify for the subsidies.\"* http://knoxblogs.com/humphreyhill/2013/09/30/coverkids-covertn-accesstn-coverrx-either-ending-limiting-enrollment-aca/\n\n*\"The state of Tennessee this month notified thousands of residents that they will lose coverage under a TennCare-sponsored program that helps small businesses and the self-employed buy health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act. The letter states that as a limited-benefit plan, CoverTN does not cover all the services required by the federal law and will no longer exist as of Jan. 1. CoverTN had a $25,000 annual limit on benefits. The federal health law does not allow yearly expenditure caps.*\" http://www.wbir.com/story/news/health/2013/09/09/covertn-health-plan-ending/2791105/", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1ubzdv", "selftext": "So your point is that TN is violating the law.

All of the states will likely have to reduce school funding to pay for ObamaCare if they accept it, so this is a legitimate point. Do we agree that few states have that much cash lying around, that most will need to shift education funds? 63% of their budget goes to education. The ACA would cost Indiana $1.4 billion. **Most (or all) of that $1.4 billion would come from the $18.6 billion school budget.**\n\n\"*Indiana spends about 63 percent of its budget on education. Last year, the General Assembly increased education funding to restore cuts made during the worst of the recession... Currently, one out of six Indiana residents is on Medicaid, or about 1.1 million Hoosiers. Medicaid takes up 14 percent of the state's budget. Under the federal Affordable Care Act (or Obamacare), Indiana can expand Medicaid to cover more uninsured Hoosiers at a projected cost to taxpayers of more than $1.4 billion by 2020.

We seek to increase healthcare choice and options, contain costs and reduce mandates, simplify the system for patients and providers, restore cuts made to Medicare, and equalize the tax treatment of group and individual health insurance plans. For most Americans, those who are insured now or who seek insurance in the future, our practical, non-intrusive reforms will promote flexibility in State leadership in healthcare reform, promote a free-market based system, and empower consumer choice.

The IRS tried to accomplish this in its May 2012 final regulation covering this provision. The regulation ignored the clear limitations in the law\u2019s text for premium assistance subsidies. It redefined \u201cexchange\u201d to mean \u201cstate exchange, regional exchange, subsidiary exchange, and federally facilitated exchange.\u201d That in effect eliminated the statutory language restricting subsidies to exchanges \u201cestablished by the state under section 1311\u201d of the ACA...   A number of key provisions in the ACA\u2019s overall plan for increased federal control of health insurance decisions are linked to the IRS rule under challenge. The law\u2019s employer mandate penalties only apply if and when an employee of a noncompliant firm actually enrolls in an exchange-based plan and receives a premium assistance tax credit. Individual mandate penalties do not apply to anyone who only faces coverage offers that cost more than 8 percent of their annual household income. Any receipt of a federal premium assistance tax credit reduces the net out-of-pocket premium that an individual must pay, whereas the absence of such credits in effect lowers the premium cost threshold for unaffordability and an exemption from the individual mandate\u2019s penalty. Hence, any court ruling that finds such tax credits illegal in a state with a federally established exchange would negate or severely weaken mandate enforcement penalties in that jurisdiction. Lack of a subsidy also would make such ACA-based coverage far less attractive compared to other private market alternatives.\" http://www.american.com/archive/2013/october/obamacares-next-bout-more-legal-challenges", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "youarefeelingsleepy", "id": "t1_cehflw2", "parent_id": "t1_cehdo84", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431800719, "controversiality": 0, "body": "What does any of this have to do with my original question?", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ubzdv", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cehflw2", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1388875792", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "RomanNumeralVI", "id": "t1_cehdo84", "parent_id": "t3_1ubzdv", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431799734, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ubzdv", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cehdo84", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1388871435", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}

Mussolini was the first socialist to lead socialism on this authoritarian path, and he is the father of fascism. He best defined fascism. *\"Fascism should more appropriately be called Corporatism because it is a merger of state and corporate power.\" Benito Mussolini.* Singapore has effectively begun to merge the \"state and corporate power\" much like Mussolini and Hitler did, and for the same reason, to benefit the people.\n\nSingapore has a fascist rather than a socialist economy (by Mussolini's definition) because the government has an important role in it (other than just regulating it).

however, it's \"those in brussels\" when they talk about eu-politicians. by comparison i almost never heard the phrase \"those in vienna\".\n\nfor many, the eu is still an anonymous force that dictates our legislation and forces us to an unwanted solidarity.\n\nperhaps, this current uprising of right-wing-parties is a consequence of the internal eu-structure. in many fields the countries of the eu have grown together so tight, that the single country can not make much legislature on their own. at the same time the national governments try to keep up the image of an autonomous state. next year in the eu-elections it will be the same feeling again: we vote for \"our\" politicians to advocate \"our\" concerns -- because that's the way the system is set up. but all attempts that could change that (e.g. that i could vote for politicians from another country) would require the consent of all 28 eu-members, which in the past has been prevented by a single country's referendum a couple of times.\n\nhm... while writing this, it gets more and more clear to me, that the original problem might be something comletely different.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ceb6bll", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1388158743", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cea53z9", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1427976705, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1toxdt", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ceaqd7d", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1388096335", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1toxdt", "selftext": "&gt;

The Klan promoted fundamentalism and devout patriotism along with advocating white supremacy. They blasted bootleggers, motion pictures and espoused a return to \"clean\" living. Appealing to folks uncomfortable with the shifting nature of America from a rural agricultural society to an urban industrial nation, the Klan attacked the elite, urbanites and intellectuals.*\n\n*Their message struck a cord, and membership in the Klan ballooned in the 1920s. By the middle of the decade, estimates for national membership in this secret organization ranged from three million to as high as eight million Klansmen. And membership was not limited to the poor and uneducated on society's fringes. Mainstream, middle-class Americans donned the white robes of the Klan too. Doctors, lawyers and ministers became loyal supporters of the KKK. In Ohio alone their ranks surged to 300,000. Even northeastern states were not immune. In Pennsylvania, membership reached 200,000. The Klan remained a clandestine society, but it was by no means isolated or marginalized.*\n\n*In the 1920s, the Klan moved in many states to dominate local and state politics. The Klan devised a strategy called the \"decade,\" in which every member of the Klan was responsible for recruiting ten people to vote for Klan candidates in elections. In 1924 the Klan succeeded in engineering the elections of officials from coast to coast, including the mayors of Portland, Maine, and Portland, Oregon. In some states, such as Colorado and Indiana, they placed enough Klansmen in positions of power to effectively control the state government.

The good list is already under contract.\n\nThe LA Times recently had an article on the bill to license pharmacists and veterinarians for practicing medicine, but that bill failed. My physician is young and has a pile of student debt so she left medicine and took a better job in biotech. Those near retirement are poised go retire a few years early, if necessary, but it is really not a \"boycott\". No one wants to pay money to see patients. \n\n**A more important question is if there will be any hospitals accepting Covered California.** There is no problem except with the bronze plan. The hospitals presume that people with a $5k (or even a $2k) deductible will never actually pay them this. I have heard that *possibly* no hospitals have agreed to accept Bronze policies. This is however just a rumor. If they decide not to take Covered California they will still admit you in emergencies. All Covered California needs to do is to contract to pay the hospitals when people who make minimum wage don't actually arrive with $5k in cash.\n\nExcept for the LA Times article (from maybe September) and the fact the Blue Shield has multiple provider lists, none of this is fact, it is just what I hear.", "id": "t1_cdytvz7", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "RomanNumeralVI", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1sl2xm", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428276634, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdytvz7", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386731814", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}

I went back to school for four years and got a degree in a field I was assured was a growth industry (it no longer is), and now have over $25,000 in outstanding student loans. Since I began my job search in 2008, I've done everything possible to gain employment. But I have experienced significant job discrimination because of my disabilities and my age. I'm resigned to the fact that I haven't any legitimate prospects of becoming employed before I'm eligible to collect social security. Due to my current non-taxable income level, I was able to enroll in the Income-Based-Repayment program and my current loan payment is zero dollars per year. It will continue to be zero dollars per year even after I begin collect social security. The only way the government will get a dime out of me is if I can actually get some kind of job, so your statement that any serious grownup has no options is incorrect. I really feel students of all ages should more closely examine the payment options open to them. If you're unemployed, or underemployed, you do have repayment options; like income-contingent-repayment or income-based-repayment, which take into account your income (or lack of same).

The ACA not only offers him *nothing at all* (but it gives big tax breaks to those making $90k) it actually took away his state-paid plan and it ended funding for emergency treatment of the homeless. He was promised that he could keep his insurance, well he can't and replacing it will cost him 60% of his income.\n\nIt is absurd to blame his state, his state can't afford the ACA, it is a poor state. Half of those in America in his position can be billed at 60% of their annual income to enroll in ObamaCare. You blame Tennessee rather than the people who wrote the ACA? Why didn't they write the ACA so that it covers more than half of America.\n\nI appreciate your research that found that rather than 100% of his income it would only be 30%. I presume that the deductible is $5,000? If we add $3636 and $5000 then it costs $8,636. I checked months ago, rates were higher perhaps or perhaps I forgot, so I do appreciate the correction.\n\nThe really mean part of the ACA was taking away the health care the poor guy has now. I can understand not letting him get the benefits others will get, but why ALSO take away CoverTn? Now he has nothing. What is he supposed to do now? \n\nThe ACA is just too expensive for TN, so only the people in the more affluent states will benefit from the ACA. A good bill would have left the states out and would have fully funded the ACA.

The US Constitution doesn't specifically say who *can* vote; it just gives several reasons that *can't* be used to deny suffrage.  These are: \n\n- Where you're born.  No difference between natural born and naturalized citizens. (14th Amend). \n\n- Race, color, previous status as a slave (15th Amend). \n\n- Sex (19th). \n\n- Residence in Washington D.C. (23rd Amend).\n\n- Failure to pay poll tax (24th Amend). \n\n- Age, 18+ (26th Amend). \n\nNotice that citizenship is not listed as a reason people can't be denied suffrage.  In fact, early in the nation's history, most states allowed non-citizens to vote.  (Ex: \"all men, having sufficient evidence of permanent common interest with, and attachment to, the community, have the right of suffrage.\" *Virginia Bill of Rights*, 1776).\n\nHowever, states started to limit the right of non-citizens to vote in the 1800s, and the last state that allowed non-citizens to vote was Arkansas up until 1926.  Today, **no state allows non-citizens to vote in state elections. In federal elections, it is a crime for a non-citizen to vote or to register to vote.** (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 611. There are actually at least four federal crimes someone would be guilty of if a non-citizen tried to vote, but that's one of them). \n\nAs we've mentioned before, when yo register to vote, you need to enter you're driver's licence number. So, you asked if a state issued ID to a non-citizen would qualify.  The answer to that would be that *ID* would qualify, but the *person* would not.  The DMV notes whether the driver is a citizen when they issue a licence.  When the non-citizen submits that number, it will be cross referenced with the DMV database, as required by HAVA, and it will show that the person is not eligible and has committed four federal crimes.

In fact, early in the nation's history, most states allowed non-citizens to vote.  (Ex: \"all men, having sufficient evidence of permanent common interest with, and attachment to, the community, have the right of suffrage.\" *Virginia Bill of Rights*, 1776).\n\nHowever, states started to limit the right of non-citizens to vote in the 1800s, and the last state that allowed non-citizens to vote was Arkansas up until 1926.

The DMV notes whether the driver is a citizen when they issue a licence.

In fact, early in the nation's history, most states allowed non-citizens to vote.  (Ex: \"all men, having sufficient evidence of permanent common interest with, and attachment to, the community, have the right of suffrage.\" *Virginia Bill of Rights*, 1776).\n\nHowever, states started to limit the right of non-citizens to vote in the 1800s, and the last state that allowed non-citizens to vote was Arkansas up until 1926.  Today, **no state allows non-citizens to vote in state elections. In federal elections, it is a crime for a non-citizen to vote or to register to vote.** (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 611.

The DMV notes whether the driver is a citizen when they issue a licence.

The US Constitution doesn't specifically say who *can* vote; it just gives several reasons that *can't* be used to deny suffrage.  These are: \n\n- Where you're born.  No difference between natural born and naturalized citizens. (14th Amend). \n\n- Race, color, previous status as a slave (15th Amend). \n\n- Sex (19th). \n\n- Residence in Washington D.C. (23rd Amend).\n\n- Failure to pay poll tax (24th Amend). \n\n- Age, 18+ (26th Amend). \n\nNotice that citizenship is not listed as a reason people can't be denied suffrage.  In fact, early in the nation's history, most states allowed non-citizens to vote.  (Ex: \"all men, having sufficient evidence of permanent common interest with, and attachment to, the community, have the right of suffrage.\" *Virginia Bill of Rights*, 1776).\n\nHowever, states started to limit the right of non-citizens to vote in the 1800s, and the last state that allowed non-citizens to vote was Arkansas up until 1926.  Today, **no state allows non-citizens to vote in state elections. In federal elections, it is a crime for a non-citizen to vote or to register to vote.** (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 611.

So, you asked if a state issued ID to a non-citizen would qualify.  The answer to that would be that *ID* would qualify, but the *person* would not.  The DMV notes whether the driver is a citizen when they issue a licence.  When the non-citizen submits that number, it will be cross referenced with the DMV database, as required by HAVA, and it will show that the person is not eligible and has committed four federal crimes.

If married both sisters would have $10.5 million each for an exemption. They could also pay the bill over 15 years and get a pretty low cost loan (~3%?) to extend it even further out.  ($100 - 10.5x2)x40%/15years = $2.1 million/year from a company banking 6.5 million per year after tax at the highest rate, this isn't including cash the company has on hand and other liquid assets the father had (I hope he didn't live in his car).  I would also like to point out that there is some poor financial planning on the fathers part. He should have set up various insurance plans and trusts with the daughters as beneficiaries.  Why the daughters also could not sell stock in the company I don't know, keeping the majority of the business in their hands and able to buy out the other later.... \n\nChina also has a 25% corporate tax rate with a top rate of 45% for personal income.  There is also the side thing that large corporations (the kind that can throw around $100mil), being a socialist/communist state, are partly owned by the state. But that doesnt affect the bid price.\n\nI'd push back on the US bidder bidding $65mil for something worth $100mill. That's simply not how it works. The profits of the company would flow to the new parent company (if they wanted to drain it and not reinvest) the company would then get the full $100mill (but it will be taxed there). Bidding at 65mil would mean you would get an immediate 35 mill cap gains hit AND taxes on the income.   \n\nBoeing and the justice department might also have something to say about one of it's parts manufacturers relocating to china.\n\nBut I get your point. The parent made a profitable business, he is gifting it to his children, and the government is trying to take a slice of the pie. This taxation hurts to new sole owners of the company who were lucky enough to have parents give them something like that.\n\nWhile I don't accept the full premise as stories like this are common to hear but in reality don't happen because they have better planners. I'd like to point out that the small community just got an injection of $68mil after tax of foreign money that they could use to help the community, start new businesses. Just throwing that in the DOW you would get a a better return over 10 years than through the company (assuming you invest the after tax income into the DOW as well). After 10 years the company profit after tax and compounded monthly would be ~99million while the after tax of putting the chinese money into the DOW for 10 years (after tax) is ~109million.\n\nBut your solution was limited specifically to a small town that is (seemingly) built around one company. I was looking for really a macro answer on how to bring the low wage working off of welfare programs.

This includes Amish corporations, (if we accept the theory hypothetically that a corporation can be religious), when the Amish do not believe in any of these social programs as a fundamental part of their religion.\n\nWhy don't we let Amish employees, (who actually are religious persons), exercise their religion by not paying for medicare, social security, unemployment, and in some cases State disability programs?  They never collect from these programs because it violates their religion.  Does a corporation have greater religious rights than an actual person?\n\nShould Amish corporations, (assuming again that corporations can be religious), be allowed to opt out of providing any health insurance and also not have to pay a penalty?  The Amish don't believe in health insurance.  If the answer is yes, half the corporations in the U.S. are about to become Amish, without changing anything else about how they do business.\n\n\"This will not be an issue here because the issue being litigated will then be settled law.\"\n\nLOL.

Wade.  \n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdqb1vv", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1385833061", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdq929q", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428452587, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1rkunm", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdq9bfb", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1385827841", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

Both include uniform health insurance benefits, although worker's comp varies by State.  This includes Amish corporations, (if we accept the theory hypothetically that a corporation can be religious), when the Amish do not believe in any of these social programs as a fundamental part of their religion.\n\nWhy don't we let Amish employees, (who actually are religious persons), exercise their religion by not paying for medicare, social security, unemployment, and in some cases State disability programs?  They never collect from these programs because it violates their religion.  Does a corporation have greater religious rights than an actual person?\n\nShould Amish corporations, (assuming again that corporations can be religious), be allowed to opt out of providing any health insurance and also not have to pay a penalty?  The Amish don't believe in health insurance.  If the answer is yes, half the corporations in the U.S. are about to become Amish, without changing anything else about how they do business.\n\n\"This will not be an issue here because the issue being litigated will then be settled law.\"\n\nLOL.

She visited tea party groups and anyone else who would listen, while also using conventional lobbying of legislators.\n\nAfter the fall elections, Puig said, FreedomWorks will push to raise the $50 million program cap to $100 million.

The resulting U.S. deficit of $273 billion in bilateral trade with Beijing reflects a persistent feature of the Sino-American relationship since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Over the last ten years, China has mounted the biggest challenge to the U.S. manufacturing sector ever seen, threatening producers of steel, chemicals, glass, paper, drugs and any number of other items with prices they cannot match. Not coincidentally, the United States has lost an average of 50,000 manufacturing jobs every month during the same period... But once China was in the WTO, its steel output rose rapidly while U.S. production drifted downward. Last year, China produced eleven times as much steel as America (880 million tons versus 81 million). The huge size of the Chinese industry now makes it a dominant force in both the global steel market and the market for production inputs such as iron ore and metallurgical coal.

This however is an entirely separate question, **if** we should ship our good jobs offshore. As long as we want to send the jobs away *anyway*, then NAFTA is good because we benefit by sending them to Mexico and Canada. NAFTA has the benefit of shipping more good American jobs to Canada or Mexico *rather than to China* who is less likely to buy from us. They use these jobs to build their economies, which is good, because our economies are closely linked, we benefit more than if we shipped all of our good jobs just to China.\n\nThere are industries that we can manage well and others that we can't. \n\nFor example we can design the iphone but we can't build one for less than about $4k. We design them and the Chinese build them. Everyone is happy because we are doing what we do best and because Americans don't want iphones to cost $4k.\n\nSteel is another example, we closed our steel industry down because it produced greenhouse gasses and American labor costs are high. Now we buy Chinese steel instead and the greenhouse gas pollution is in China. Whatever we want that produces pollution we buy from somewhere else, oil for example. Mexico, Canada, Venezuela and Nigeria accept the massive environmental pollution necessary for us to have our energy. Mexico has decimated their fisheries so that we can have inexpensive fish, our fisheries are in much better shape and the price of fish is low. Everyone is happy.\n\nClosing blue collar industries disproportionately affects minorities which is *part* of the reason that their unemployment rate has almost doubled, but **IF** we want to shut these industries down NAFTA is good for us.\n\nCanada makes a lot of paper for us, if we made all of that paper it would either cause pollution or the pollution control would raise the cost of the paper.  We don't want Americans to make paper, we design iphones, grow oranges, and provide financial services to the Canadians to pay for our paper and oil.", "id": "t1_cdla2ko", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "RomanNumeralVI", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdlmtme", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "flyersfan314", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1r88r7", "selftext": "Maybe you are correct.\n\n*\"Last week, the federal government reported that the U.S. trade deficit grew by 33 percent in 2010 to nearly half a trillion dollars. Most of the gap resulted from an imbalance in trade with China, which shipped $365 billion in goods to America but only bought $92 billion in U.S. goods. The resulting U.S. deficit of $273 billion in bilateral trade with Beijing reflects a persistent feature of the Sino-American relationship since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Over the last ten years, China has mounted the biggest challenge to the U.S. manufacturing sector ever seen, threatening producers of steel, chemicals, glass, paper, drugs and any number of other items with prices they cannot match. Not coincidentally, the United States has lost an average of 50,000 manufacturing jobs every month during the same period... But once China was in the WTO, its steel output rose rapidly while U.S. production drifted downward. Last year, China produced eleven times as much steel as America (880 million tons versus 81 million). The huge size of the Chinese industry now makes it a dominant force in both the global steel market and the market for production inputs such as iron ore and metallurgical coal.

Anyways, in regards to your inquiry about those with an IRA or a pension you may need to clear up what you mean. What would happen to those who have one now? Or are you asking if there would be people with them in a socialist economy? As for them voting on decisions, I would first like to say socialism is all about democracy and it's extension into the work place. Anyways, pensions/IRAs/etc would vary based on the \"company\". I say company like that because it wouldn't be like a traditional company is today, but I'll return to that. Some of these worker self directed \"companies\" may choose to have pensioners invest in their company, or maybe not. Maybe some of these worker owned companies would have the pension owners participate in the decision making, or maybe not. There is no one clear answer. If this is your only issue with socialism than you seem to be nitpicking. Anyways, with all this talk of investing, I must remind you that we are assuming that it is in the beginning stages of socialism as eventually money and the market would be phased out. Lastly, it is quite probable thay in a socialist economy a program would be out in place to care for the old.\n\n&gt;\" They view things such as bosses, boards of directors, CEOs ect. \" Does this mean that the Socialist Party will not have a boss? Will nationalized companies be closed? If not, they will have no bosses?\n\nPlease reread the definition of socialism. Basically, workers will become their own bosses. Rather than CEO's or board of directors making decisions, the workers would do so democratically. It could be simple majority democracy, consensus democracy, representative democracy, or some other variant depending on the particular company. Socialism just rejects the idea that it is necessary or preferable to have a handful of people (or just one) making decisions that affect many many others. \n\nUnfortunately I do not have the foresight to know how a socialist party would be organized. However it doesn't really matter as they would be in a democratic government and not a participant in the production process. A quick note about government, socialists have varying opinions on it. Some believe it should play an active role in the economy while others (myself included) believe it should play a minimal role. Those who believe it's role should be small are called libertarian socialists. \n\n&gt;My community hospital is a corporation. Will you close it? Will it then not have a boss?\n\nNah I don't plan on shutting down community hospitals. They would most likely be restructured to allow the community to have more of a say in it's operation as well as the people who work there.

However I don't think they are what socialists view as the problem per se. Obviously no matter how society is organized there will be those such as the old who need to be cared for. In socialism, capitalism or any other system. In capitalism it is just done in a risky way that utilizes the workers exploitation (this may be a topic we have to discuss) without their choice or direct acknowledgement.\n\n&gt;I don't recall Marx describing the bourgeoisie as you do.\n\nI don't mean to sound condescending, but this is how he typically uses it, as well as how socialists use it. In Capital, the Communist Manifesto, etc, he uses capitalist and bourgeoisie more or less interchangeably. This is how socialists use the word to this day. I will explain more down further.\n\n&gt;\"1 : middle class; also plural in construction : members of the middle class 2 : a social order dominated by bourgeois \"\n\nYes, that is how it was originally used and defined. However, when used by socialists it is meant to mean capitalists or the capitalist class. Capitalts are basically those who own capital. Capital meaning means of production, machines, money, or commodities depending on the stage in which the utilization of capital is at. This is something we may need to discuss. Class is an interesting topic really. Classical political economists used to, and Marxists still do define class not by wealth (although one must acknowledge the correlation between wealth and class) but by a persons relation with the means of production. You can own them, work on them, or a mix. So \"middle class\" really has no meaning in Marxist terminology as it is an idea based on wealth. When thinking in Marxist terms, there are three classes:\n\n1) proletariats\n\n2) petty bourgeoisie\n\n3)bourgeoisie\n\nI can explain further if you want me to.\n\n&gt; \"Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other \u2014 Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\" Karl Marx \n\nI don't know why you added this, as it seems to prove my point. The epoch of the bourgeoisie is characterized by the simple antagonistic relationship between proletariats and the bourgeoisie, or, workers and capitalists,  or exploited and exoloiters, or propertied and propertyless*.\n\n*property referring to productive property- ie factories, farms, machines, etc.\n\nHere is a pretty good explanation of class.

As for the cooperative planning, market socialists think this is unnecessary and that the market is the best way organize things. It has been brought to my attention before that my definition is similar to Wikipedia's. This is accidental and I don't think it should really matter.  \n\nAs for the definition of communism \n\n*it is a term describing a stateless classless and moneyless society in which productive property is held in common. Sometimes used to describe the movement to achieve this.*\n\nThis is pretty straight forward and agreed upon. What I will say is that no one expects to achieve that over night.

However I don't think they are what socialists view as the problem per se. Obviously no matter how society is organized there will be those such as the old who need to be cared for. In socialism, capitalism or any other system. In capitalism it is just done in a risky way that utilizes the workers exploitation (this may be a topic we have to discuss) without their choice or direct acknowledgement.\n\n&gt;I don't recall Marx describing the bourgeoisie as you do.\n\nI don't mean to sound condescending, but this is how he typically uses it, as well as how socialists use it. In Capital, the Communist Manifesto, etc, he uses capitalist and bourgeoisie more or less interchangeably. This is how socialists use the word to this day. I will explain more down further.\n\n&gt;\"1 : middle class; also plural in construction : members of the middle class 2 : a social order dominated by bourgeois \"\n\nYes, that is how it was originally used and defined. However, when used by socialists it is meant to mean capitalists or the capitalist class. Capitalts are basically those who own capital. Capital meaning means of production, machines, money, or commodities depending on the stage in which the utilization of capital is at. This is something we may need to discuss. Class is an interesting topic really. Classical political economists used to, and Marxists still do define class not by wealth (although one must acknowledge the correlation between wealth and class) but by a persons relation with the means of production. You can own them, work on them, or a mix. So \"middle class\" really has no meaning in Marxist terminology as it is an idea based on wealth. When thinking in Marxist terms, there are three classes:\n\n1) proletariats\n\n2) petty bourgeoisie\n\n3)bourgeoisie\n\nI can explain further if you want me to.\n\n&gt; \"Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other \u2014 Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\" Karl Marx \n\nI don't know why you added this, as it seems to prove my point. The epoch of the bourgeoisie is characterized by the simple antagonistic relationship between proletariats and the bourgeoisie, or, workers and capitalists,  or exploited and exoloiters, or propertied and propertyless*.\n\n*property referring to productive property- ie factories, farms, machines, etc.\n\nHere is a pretty good explanation of class.

Anyways, in regards to your inquiry about those with an IRA or a pension you may need to clear up what you mean. What would happen to those who have one now? Or are you asking if there would be people with them in a socialist economy? As for them voting on decisions, I would first like to say socialism is all about democracy and it's extension into the work place. Anyways, pensions/IRAs/etc would vary based on the \"company\". I say company like that because it wouldn't be like a traditional company is today, but I'll return to that. Some of these worker self directed \"companies\" may choose to have pensioners invest in their company, or maybe not. Maybe some of these worker owned companies would have the pension owners participate in the decision making, or maybe not. There is no one clear answer. If this is your only issue with socialism than you seem to be nitpicking. Anyways, with all this talk of investing, I must remind you that we are assuming that it is in the beginning stages of socialism as eventually money and the market would be phased out. Lastly, it is quite probable thay in a socialist economy a program would be out in place to care for the old.\n\n&gt;\" They view things such as bosses, boards of directors, CEOs ect. \" Does this mean that the Socialist Party will not have a boss? Will nationalized companies be closed? If not, they will have no bosses?\n\nPlease reread the definition of socialism. Basically, workers will become their own bosses. Rather than CEO's or board of directors making decisions, the workers would do so democratically. It could be simple majority democracy, consensus democracy, representative democracy, or some other variant depending on the particular company. Socialism just rejects the idea that it is necessary or preferable to have a handful of people (or just one) making decisions that affect many many others. \n\nUnfortunately I do not have the foresight to know how a socialist party would be organized. However it doesn't really matter as they would be in a democratic government and not a participant in the production process. A quick note about government, socialists have varying opinions on it. Some believe it should play an active role in the economy while others (myself included) believe it should play a minimal role. Those who believe it's role should be small are called libertarian socialists. \n\n&gt;My community hospital is a corporation. Will you close it? Will it then not have a boss?\n\nNah I don't plan on shutting down community hospitals. They would most likely be restructured to allow the community to have more of a say in it's operation as well as the people who work there.

However I don't think they are what socialists view as the problem per se. Obviously no matter how society is organized there will be those such as the old who need to be cared for. In socialism, capitalism or any other system. In capitalism it is just done in a risky way that utilizes the workers exploitation (this may be a topic we have to discuss) without their choice or direct acknowledgement.\n\n&gt;I don't recall Marx describing the bourgeoisie as you do.\n\nI don't mean to sound condescending, but this is how he typically uses it, as well as how socialists use it. In Capital, the Communist Manifesto, etc, he uses capitalist and bourgeoisie more or less interchangeably. This is how socialists use the word to this day. I will explain more down further.\n\n&gt;\"1 : middle class; also plural in construction : members of the middle class 2 : a social order dominated by bourgeois \"\n\nYes, that is how it was originally used and defined. However, when used by socialists it is meant to mean capitalists or the capitalist class. Capitalts are basically those who own capital. Capital meaning means of production, machines, money, or commodities depending on the stage in which the utilization of capital is at. This is something we may need to discuss. Class is an interesting topic really. Classical political economists used to, and Marxists still do define class not by wealth (although one must acknowledge the correlation between wealth and class) but by a persons relation with the means of production. You can own them, work on them, or a mix. So \"middle class\" really has no meaning in Marxist terminology as it is an idea based on wealth. When thinking in Marxist terms, there are three classes:\n\n1) proletariats\n\n2) petty bourgeoisie\n\n3)bourgeoisie\n\nI can explain further if you want me to.\n\n&gt; \"Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other \u2014 Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\" Karl Marx \n\nI don't know why you added this, as it seems to prove my point. The epoch of the bourgeoisie is characterized by the simple antagonistic relationship between proletariats and the bourgeoisie, or, workers and capitalists,  or exploited and exoloiters, or propertied and propertyless*.\n\n*property referring to productive property- ie factories, farms, machines, etc.\n\nHere is a pretty good explanation of class. You really only need to watch the first 5 minutes, but it's only 12 min in total. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGOA2WedIQo&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player", "edited": 1384285343, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1qcx7k", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdcqfax", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384285025", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdchi11", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428692058, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1384259928, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1qcx7k", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdchjwq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384259654", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdchb82", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428692082, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Okay good.

If there were no profits and there will never be any profits, why are jobs then created?\n\nEr, what I understand to be called 'profit' is a concept that really only applies to market systems, or systems that mimic particular market features, and it's a semantics argument whether a society with worker-owned production has 'profit' per se. Capitalism, in the abstract sense, is profit-driven. \n\nIn reality though, there are no market societies, except for complete disaster areas. For example, aerospace, computers, telecommunications and much of biotech was developed outside the market system. If Boeing today was left to its profit-making devices, it would go under very quickly. The DOD's concern, for one, was usually long-term development, not just raking in dough or blindly expanding production.\n\n&gt;Socialists only create jobs to get profits. True, they intend to use these for good purposes, but why would they create jobs that are not needed?\n\nYou'll have to define what you mean by profits.\n\nI think it's useful to treat capitalism, markets and money as related but separate concepts. \n\nTo me, a profit-driven society is a society driven by relatively short-term capital gains. So, the spirit of socialism is actually to overcome that and create a society driven by social needs and public interests. It's entirely debatable how much of this market-focused socialism can accomplish without some kind of public oversight, like community owned and run credit unions, maybe. \n\nBut there's more than just market socialism. There's ideas for decentralized planned economics like [parecon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_economics). There's distributed [mutual credit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_credit), which could be linked by chains of community trust, like a peer to peer network, and possibly even keep some of the useful bits of regular markets. There's no shortage of ideas, but society's complicated, so I think you can't have a detailed blueprint without some sort of trial and error. \n\n&gt;Under socialism it matters greatly because no one pays any taxes under socialism.\n\nI don't see how that's a given. If there's no money, you obviously can't have taxes. If you're using currency, I think something like taxation can exist with or even without a state, honestly, so long as the currency is credible. It's just people pooling resources represented by some quantifiable sums of labor promised to one another.", "edited": 1384325544, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1qcx7k", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdd6ict", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384322999", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdckufx", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428680536, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdd5rtr", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1384320673", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

If there were no profits and there will never be any profits, why are jobs then created?\n\nEr, what I understand to be called 'profit' is a concept that really only applies to market systems, or systems that mimic particular market features, and it's a semantics argument whether a society with worker-owned production has 'profit' per se. Capitalism, in the abstract sense, is profit-driven. \n\nIn reality though, there are no market societies, except for complete disaster areas. For example, aerospace, computers, telecommunications and much of biotech was developed outside the market system. If Boeing today was left to its profit-making devices, it would go under very quickly. The DOD's concern, for one, was usually long-term development, not just raking in dough or blindly expanding production.\n\n&gt;Socialists only create jobs to get profits. True, they intend to use these for good purposes, but why would they create jobs that are not needed?\n\nYou'll have to define what you mean by profits.\n\nI think it's useful to treat capitalism, markets and money as related but separate concepts. \n\nTo me, a profit-driven society is a society driven by relatively short-term capital gains. So, the spirit of socialism is actually to overcome that and create a society driven by social needs and public interests. It's entirely debatable how much of this market-focused socialism can accomplish without some kind of public oversight, like community owned and run credit unions, maybe. \n\nBut there's more than just market socialism. There's ideas for decentralized planned economics like [parecon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_economics). There's distributed [mutual credit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_credit), which could be linked by chains of community trust, like a peer to peer network, and possibly even keep some of the useful bits of regular markets. There's no shortage of ideas, but society's complicated, so I think you can't have a detailed blueprint without some sort of trial and error. \n\n&gt;Under socialism it matters greatly because no one pays any taxes under socialism.\n\nI don't see how that's a given. If there's no money, you obviously can't have taxes. If you're using currency, I think something like taxation can exist with or even without a state, honestly, so long as the currency is credible.

If there were no profits and there will never be any profits, why are jobs then created?\n\nEr, what I understand to be called 'profit' is a concept that really only applies to market systems, or systems that mimic particular market features, and it's a semantics argument whether a society with worker-owned production has 'profit' per se. Capitalism, in the abstract sense, is profit-driven. \n\nIn reality though, there are no market societies, except for complete disaster areas. For example, aerospace, computers, telecommunications and much of biotech was developed outside the market system. If Boeing today was left to its profit-making devices, it would go under very quickly. The DOD's concern, for one, was usually long-term development, not just raking in dough or blindly expanding production.\n\n&gt;Socialists only create jobs to get profits. True, they intend to use these for good purposes, but why would they create jobs that are not needed?\n\nYou'll have to define what you mean by profits.\n\nI think it's useful to treat capitalism, markets and money as related but separate concepts. \n\nTo me, a profit-driven society is a society driven by relatively short-term capital gains. So, the spirit of socialism is actually to overcome that and create a society driven by social needs and public interests. It's entirely debatable how much of this market-focused socialism can accomplish without some kind of public oversight, like community owned and run credit unions, maybe. \n\nBut there's more than just market socialism. There's ideas for decentralized planned economics like [parecon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_economics). There's distributed [mutual credit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_credit), which could be linked by chains of community trust, like a peer to peer network, and possibly even keep some of the useful bits of regular markets. There's no shortage of ideas, but society's complicated, so I think you can't have a detailed blueprint without some sort of trial and error. \n\n&gt;Under socialism it matters greatly because no one pays any taxes under socialism.\n\nI don't see how that's a given. If there's no money, you obviously can't have taxes. If you're using currency, I think something like taxation can exist with or even without a state, honestly, so long as the currency is credible.

First, the size of the state has nothing to do with whether or not they accepted medicaid expansion. \n\nKentucky has a 40 billion dollar budget. Tennessee has a 60 billion dollar budget. Big states, small states, all accepted medicaid funding. The discriminating factor wasn't state budget size, it was which party controlled the capitol. If it was up to democrats, the state accepted the funding. If it was up to republicans, the state did not.\n\nThere were even a few cases where the republicans sucked it up and did it because the deal was just too good to pass up (Ohio and Arizona are good examples)\n\nWhat do I mean by a good deal? For the first three years, the medicaid expansion is 100% paid for. It's free money for those three years. After three years, it gradually increases up to a whopping total of 10% of the cost. \n\nYes, you read that right, the federal government will cover 90% of the cost of the expansion. So what the states are saying to the poor is \"we can't give you better healthcare because we can't bring ourselves to pay 10% of the cost eventually. \n\nThe ACA works incredibly well if you just implement the medicaid expansion, and any state that decides not to do so is just being partisan at the expense of their most vulnerable workers.\n\nSo don't blame the ACA for not giving assistance to people who didn't have it before the ACA and won't have it now because of the state's stubborn refusal to take the federal money.\n\nIt's like complaining that you don't get beer because you won't pitch in for 10% of the cost of the keg, when the party didn't have beer before I bought it. \n\n", "id": "t1_cd6rlpg", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "harddata", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cd62wnw", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428790840, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd6rlpg", "author_flair_text": "[Political Consultant/BA Pol Sci][Center-Left]", "created_utc": "1383601316", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cd629az", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428871870, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ptp1r", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd62wnw", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1383522075", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cd61tnv", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428872173, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ptp1r", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd629az", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1383520491", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cd61kwi", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428872377, "controversiality": 0, "body": "ALL US Citizens get the medical subsidies if they have to pay out of pocket for their health coverage when they file their taxes.

If they don't like ObamaCare let them die?\n\nAgain, no. The ACA offers plans for small businesses and individuals. It does not force or encourage states to cancel any benefits to the poor. It does not make Medicaid illegal. It simply prohibits plans that offer caps, and in exchange, offers better plans through healthcare.gov. \n\n&gt; We agree that any state that declines ObamaCare should not get any benefits.\n\nNo, I never stated a personal opinion about states \"should or should not\" get benefits.\n\nI said that the ACA expands Medicaid. Some states have decided not to take the money. As a result, some citizens will face higher premiums when they should have gotten Medicaid. \n\nIt bans sub par healthcare plans. In exchange it offers better plans with subsidies through Healthcare.gov. \n\nAny state that declines Medicaid expansion doesn't get expanded Medicaid. It still gets everything else (subsides, plans through healthcare exchanges).\n\n&gt; I believe that we disagree that Congress may legally control state spending and that it is wise and/or legal to retaliate by cancelling what little the poor now have.\n\nNo. You're misstating the facts. There's no retaliation. If you cancel Medicaid you don't get Medicaid. That's it. The bad healthcare plans being cancelled isn't retaliation. It's a forced upgrade for every state. It's just that some don't offer sub par plans. \n\nTennessee could have created an ACA compliant healthcare exchange. It chose not to, so citizens who'd lose coverage through CoverTN can now buy coverage from Healthcare.gov instead.\n\nSome citizens will lose benefits because they would be covered by the Medicaid expansion, which Tennessee is rejecting.\n\nEveryone else is unaffected. Everyone else gets better plans at better rates.\n\nThe only people who are affected are the people who would qualify for expanded Medicaid but won't get it because Tennessee won't take the money.\n\n&gt; I may misunderstand though, and it seems unlikely that you really support what it seems that you do. \n\nThank you. You're right, I don't support what you implied I did. Because this isn't about personal opinion. This isn't /r/politicaldiscussion. This is a simple question of facts, not opinions. \n\nThere is such a thing as correct information. There is such a thing as facts, even in politics. I stand for facts.

First, the size of the state has nothing to do with whether or not they accepted medicaid expansion. \n\nKentucky has a 40 billion dollar budget. Tennessee has a 60 billion dollar budget. Big states, small states, all accepted medicaid funding. The discriminating factor wasn't state budget size, it was which party controlled the capitol. If it was up to democrats, the state accepted the funding. If it was up to republicans, the state did not.\n\nThere were even a few cases where the republicans sucked it up and did it because the deal was just too good to pass up (Ohio and Arizona are good examples)\n\nWhat do I mean by a good deal? For the first three years, the medicaid expansion is 100% paid for. It's free money for those three years. After three years, it gradually increases up to a whopping total of 10% of the cost. \n\nYes, you read that right, the federal government will cover 90% of the cost of the expansion. So what the states are saying to the poor is \"we can't give you better healthcare because we can't bring ourselves to pay 10% of the cost eventually. \n\nThe ACA works incredibly well if you just implement the medicaid expansion, and any state that decides not to do so is just being partisan at the expense of their most vulnerable workers.\n\nSo don't blame the ACA for not giving assistance to people who didn't have it before the ACA and won't have it now because of the state's stubborn refusal to take the federal money.\n\nIt's like complaining that you don't get beer because you won't pitch in for 10% of the cost of the keg, when the party didn't have beer before I bought it. \n\n", "id": "t1_cd6rlpg", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "harddata", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cd62wnw", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428790840, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd6rlpg", "author_flair_text": "[Political Consultant/BA Pol Sci][Center-Left]", "created_utc": "1383601316", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cd629az", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428871870, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ptp1r", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd62wnw", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1383522075", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cd61tnv", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428872173, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ptp1r", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd629az", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1383520491", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cd61kwi", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428872377, "controversiality": 0, "body": "ALL US Citizens get the medical subsidies if they have to pay out of pocket for their health coverage when they file their taxes.

It chose not to, so citizens who'd lose coverage through CoverTN can now buy coverage from Healthcare.gov instead.\n\nSome citizens will lose benefits because they would be covered by the Medicaid expansion, which Tennessee is rejecting.\n\nEveryone else is unaffected. Everyone else gets better plans at better rates.\n\nThe only people who are affected are the people who would qualify for expanded Medicaid but won't get it because Tennessee won't take the money.\n\n&gt; I may misunderstand though, and it seems unlikely that you really support what it seems that you do. \n\nThank you.

They can shrink the size of state government to save extra dollars.      \n\nso essentially anyone who says \"its either cutting education or implementing Medicaid expansion\" is essentially lying to their people.\n\nlastly, provisions of the ACA means that the impact on state budgets represents only a small portion of a state's budget:\n\nThe ACA Medicaid increase will have a limited impact on total state general fund spending. To place state spending effects in context, we calculate new state Medicaid spending as a share of general fund expenditures. In the aggregate, new state Medicaid spending due to the expansion represents a 0.1% increase in total general fund expenditures nationally. If state uncompensated care savings are added, states as a whole experience net fiscal gains equal to 0.1% of total general fund spending. Even in states with the highest level of increased Medicaid costs from the expansion, new state spending relative to general fund expenditures is approximately 1% or less if uncompensated care savings are included. \n\nBecause we limited this analysis to data available for all 50 states and the District of Columbia, we were unable to estimate several potential sources of state fiscal gain from Medicaid expansion. Such gains fall into three main categories: increased federal matching rates for current-law beneficiaries other than those covered through 1115 waivers or limited benefit programs; reduced state spending on non-Medicaid health care previously furnished to uninsured residents with incomes below 138% FPL; and additional revenue, including general revenue increases caused by the boost to state economic activity that would result from increased federal Medicaid dollars being spent within the state. In addition, certain states that provide Medicaid coverage to individuals with incomes above 138% FPL could transition this coverage to Health Insurance Exchanges whether or not the states implement the Medicaid expansion. If these factors were taken into account, many more states could realize net fiscal gains. \n\nsource: http://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/8384.pdf", "id": "t1_cd1vfv6", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cd1ufin", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428945143, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd1vfv6", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1383017298", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_ccyk4pt", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428945686, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd1ufin", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1383014994", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

Democrats have a broader tent where things have to reach a more discussed consensus. There are (surprise!) conservative democrats and centrist democrats, and only a vanishing minority of liberal democrats. \n\nNot to mention, many of the more conservative democrats voted against things so it wasn't as smooth sailing as you posit. They voted against things which many other democrats supported, but wouldn't approve themselves for fear of campaign challengers and inability to raise proper funds in the next reelection campaign.

The fact is that no one knows if the number will increase or decrease. I don&amp;#39;t know and you don&amp;#39;t either, but we can talk about it here. Not every press release from the politicians is accurate.

His rate jumps from $4k to $30k because for two at age 70 that is the cost of ObamaCare on the Exchange. (He is ineligible for Medicare.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE POOR: The ACA ends subsidies for hospitals to treat the poor because it was thought that all 50 states would expand Medicaid. Where Medicaid was expanded the poor will still get medical care but in half of America the ACA eliminates the subsidy to hospitals to treat them. They were ineligible for Medicaid last year and will be ineligible next year, but now they cannot get treated at the ER anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE POOR: For half of America Medicaid didn&amp;#39;t expand. In these states the poor are ineligible for any subsidy but people making up to $90k are eligible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;FAMILIES: Many employers are dropping coverage for family members. NY TIMES: &amp;quot;Now suppose that this retailer offers health insurance to those employees and their families, but while the company pays most of the premium for each employee\u2019s individual insurance, the financial burden for family coverage is left entirely to the employees, a common practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this case, the company\u2019s decision to offer family coverage may be little more than a gesture, given that the employees have to foot the bill and the coverage is likely to be prohibitively expensive for many of them. But decisions made recently by the Internal Revenue Service, which is writing many of the regulations to carry out the law, mean this gesture could make it extremely difficult for even middle-income employees to buy insurance for their families.

The ACA has winners and losers, some Americans get screwed and others benefit, everyone agrees on this fact, so there is no need to point out that for some the ACA is a great deal.\n\n1. RETIREES: My brother in law lost his health insurance because his employer can no longer afford to cover retirees. His rate jumps from $4k to $30k because for two at age 70 that is the cost of ObamaCare on the Exchange. (He is ineligible for Medicare.)\n\n2. THE POOR: The ACA ends subsidies for hospitals to treat the poor because it was thought that all 50 states would expand Medicaid. Where Medicaid was expanded the poor will still get medical care but in half of America the ACA eliminates the subsidy to hospitals to treat them. They were ineligible for Medicaid last year and will be ineligible next year, but now they cannot get treated at the ER anymore.\n\n3. THE POOR: For half of America Medicaid didn't expand. In these states the poor are ineligible for any subsidy but people making up to $90k are eligible.\n\n4. FAMILIES: Many employers are dropping coverage for family members. NY TIMES: \"Now suppose that this retailer offers health insurance to those employees and their families, but while the company pays most of the premium for each employee\u2019s individual insurance, the financial burden for family coverage is left entirely to the employees, a common practice.\n\nIn this case, the company\u2019s decision to offer family coverage may be little more than a gesture, given that the employees have to foot the bill and the coverage is likely to be prohibitively expensive for many of them. But decisions made recently by the Internal Revenue Service, which is writing many of the regulations to carry out the law, mean this gesture could make it extremely difficult for even middle-income employees to buy insurance for their families. The obvious but perverse result would be that these employees might well beg their employers NOT to offer them health in.\" http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/in-the-affordable-care-act-some-children-left-behind/\n\n5.

And if they ever so try as standing apart for their own constituents, they put their next re-election bid at jeopardy. \n\nmaking laws and voting on them is bigger than \"I HAVE THE MOST PEOPLE. LETS STEAMROLL AS MUCH LEGISLATION I WANT AS POSSIBLE\". You have to build compromise often within your own party (And that's much of the reason why things were so slow that one year they actually had the house and the senate). You have to compromise within your own party if the other party is so adamant about nothing going through that they'll lockstep vote as one against everything. They tried to compromise with republicans, over and over and over again. But the democrats had to reach compromise within their own party, and that's why we're lucky we got ACA done at all.

In the states that declined to expand Medicaid, as of January community hospitals will not get a federal subsidy to care for the poor. In blue states they will (via Medicaid).\n\nThis is about politics too, but may we begin without politics? Poor people in the red states die because the ACA took away the federal funding for their care. (We can discuss what state government responsibilities are later.)

Let's fix it first?\n\nNow no one will die in January. The local hospitals will still treat people as before, but now they will run a deficit (see the NY Times story on this.) These hospitals are the very last people who want to deny them care. Those who mostly serve the poor though will eventually fold, one by one poor communities will lose their ER.\n\nAt some point people will die as a DIRECT result of ending the federal subsidies.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Q: It seems that if a person or family that does not qualify for the states\u2019 Medicaid program and earns too little to qualify for a subsidies they will have to pay the full insurance price or have no coverage. I thought the ACA was set up to protect these people. Is this really right or did I not understand the answer? \u2013emjay, N.J.\n\nQ. I read your article and was a little disconcerted by the Q&amp;A related to people who had too much money to qualify for Medicaid and too little to qualify for subsidies on the exchange and will have to pay full price for coverage offered on the exchanges. This was a revelation to me, because I thought the Affordable Care Act was intended to provide coverage to this specific group, who likely are the uninsured working poor. How can you earn too little to qualify for a subsidy? Aren\u2019t these the very people who need a subsidy? And what % of the population does this gap represent? What do they do for medical care? Am I missing something here? \u2013Ellen Einiger, New York, NY.\n\nA. You both understood the issue correctly. In my original column, I explained that the Obama administration\u2019s health care law aimed to expand Medicaid so that everyone under age 65 would qualify if they earned up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level (that\u2019s about $16,000 for an individual and $32,500 for a family of four in 2014). But the Supreme Court ruled in June that the decision to expand Medicaid is up to the states \u2014 and only 26 states have decided to move forward, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nSo now, people may find themselves in an unfortunate situation: they may not be eligible for Medicaid and they may earn too little to qualify for subsidies on the exchange. More specifically, if you can\u2019t get Medicaid and your income is below 100 percent of the poverty level, you will not be eligible for financial assistance on the exchange. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/10/02/readers-ask-about-subsidies-and-other-health-care-law-provisions/", "id": "t1_ccnb08v", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "RomanNumeralVI", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_ccnblnl", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "naygor", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1nwhcs", "selftext": "So you agree with the ACA to demand that red states turn blue - or that the lack of access to federally subsidized health care will kill lots of the poor in the red states?\n\nNow that sounds a bit harsh, but really that is your point?

I thought the ACA was set up to protect these people. Is this really right or did I not understand the answer? \u2013emjay, N.J.\n\nQ. I read your article and was a little disconcerted by the Q&amp;A related to people who had too much money to qualify for Medicaid and too little to qualify for subsidies on the exchange and will have to pay full price for coverage offered on the exchanges. This was a revelation to me, because I thought the Affordable Care Act was intended to provide coverage to this specific group, who likely are the uninsured working poor. How can you earn too little to qualify for a subsidy? Aren\u2019t these the very people who need a subsidy? And what % of the population does this gap represent? What do they do for medical care? Am I missing something here? \u2013Ellen Einiger, New York, NY.\n\nA. You both understood the issue correctly. In my original column, I explained that the Obama administration\u2019s health care law aimed to expand Medicaid so that everyone under age 65 would qualify if they earned up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level (that\u2019s about $16,000 for an individual and $32,500 for a family of four in 2014). But the Supreme Court ruled in June that the decision to expand Medicaid is up to the states \u2014 and only 26 states have decided to move forward, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nSo now, people may find themselves in an unfortunate situation: they may not be eligible for Medicaid and they may earn too little to qualify for subsidies on the exchange. More specifically, if you can\u2019t get Medicaid and your income is below 100 percent of the poverty level, you will not be eligible for financial assistance on the exchange. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/10/02/readers-ask-about-subsidies-and-other-health-care-law-provisions/", "id": "t1_ccnb08v", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "RomanNumeralVI", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_ccnblnl", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "naygor", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1nwhcs", "selftext": "So you agree with the ACA to demand that red states turn blue - or that the lack of access to federally subsidized health care will kill lots of the poor in the red states?\n\nNow that sounds a bit harsh, but really that is your point?

I thought the ACA was set up to protect these people. Is this really right or did I not understand the answer? \u2013emjay, N.J.\n\nQ. I read your article and was a little disconcerted by the Q&amp;A related to people who had too much money to qualify for Medicaid and too little to qualify for subsidies on the exchange and will have to pay full price for coverage offered on the exchanges. This was a revelation to me, because I thought the Affordable Care Act was intended to provide coverage to this specific group, who likely are the uninsured working poor. How can you earn too little to qualify for a subsidy? Aren\u2019t these the very people who need a subsidy? And what % of the population does this gap represent? What do they do for medical care? Am I missing something here? \u2013Ellen Einiger, New York, NY.\n\nA. You both understood the issue correctly. In my original column, I explained that the Obama administration\u2019s health care law aimed to expand Medicaid so that everyone under age 65 would qualify if they earned up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level (that\u2019s about $16,000 for an individual and $32,500 for a family of four in 2014). But the Supreme Court ruled in June that the decision to expand Medicaid is up to the states \u2014 and only 26 states have decided to move forward, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nSo now, people may find themselves in an unfortunate situation: they may not be eligible for Medicaid and they may earn too little to qualify for subsidies on the exchange. More specifically, if you can\u2019t get Medicaid and your income is below 100 percent of the poverty level, you will not be eligible for financial assistance on the exchange. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/10/02/readers-ask-about-subsidies-and-other-health-care-law-provisions/", "id": "t1_ccnb08v", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "RomanNumeralVI", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_ccnblnl", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "naygor", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1nwhcs", "selftext": "So you agree with the ACA to demand that red states turn blue - or that the lack of access to federally subsidized health care will kill lots of the poor in the red states?\n\nNow that sounds a bit harsh, but really that is your point?

I thought the ACA was set up to protect these people. Is this really right or did I not understand the answer? \u2013emjay, N.J.\n\nQ. I read your article and was a little disconcerted by the Q&amp;A related to people who had too much money to qualify for Medicaid and too little to qualify for subsidies on the exchange and will have to pay full price for coverage offered on the exchanges. This was a revelation to me, because I thought the Affordable Care Act was intended to provide coverage to this specific group, who likely are the uninsured working poor. How can you earn too little to qualify for a subsidy? Aren\u2019t these the very people who need a subsidy? And what % of the population does this gap represent? What do they do for medical care? Am I missing something here? \u2013Ellen Einiger, New York, NY.\n\nA. You both understood the issue correctly. In my original column, I explained that the Obama administration\u2019s health care law aimed to expand Medicaid so that everyone under age 65 would qualify if they earned up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level (that\u2019s about $16,000 for an individual and $32,500 for a family of four in 2014). But the Supreme Court ruled in June that the decision to expand Medicaid is up to the states \u2014 and only 26 states have decided to move forward, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nSo now, people may find themselves in an unfortunate situation: they may not be eligible for Medicaid and they may earn too little to qualify for subsidies on the exchange. More specifically, if you can\u2019t get Medicaid and your income is below 100 percent of the poverty level, you will not be eligible for financial assistance on the exchange. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/10/02/readers-ask-about-subsidies-and-other-health-care-law-provisions/", "id": "t1_ccnb08v", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "RomanNumeralVI", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_ccnblnl", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "naygor", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1nwhcs", "selftext": "So you agree with the ACA to demand that red states turn blue - or that the lack of access to federally subsidized health care will kill lots of the poor in the red states?\n\nNow that sounds a bit harsh, but really that is your point?

I thought the ACA was set up to protect these people. Is this really right or did I not understand the answer? \u2013emjay, N.J.\n\nQ. I read your article and was a little disconcerted by the Q&amp;A related to people who had too much money to qualify for Medicaid and too little to qualify for subsidies on the exchange and will have to pay full price for coverage offered on the exchanges. This was a revelation to me, because I thought the Affordable Care Act was intended to provide coverage to this specific group, who likely are the uninsured working poor. How can you earn too little to qualify for a subsidy? Aren\u2019t these the very people who need a subsidy? And what % of the population does this gap represent? What do they do for medical care? Am I missing something here? \u2013Ellen Einiger, New York, NY.\n\nA. You both understood the issue correctly. In my original column, I explained that the Obama administration\u2019s health care law aimed to expand Medicaid so that everyone under age 65 would qualify if they earned up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level (that\u2019s about $16,000 for an individual and $32,500 for a family of four in 2014). But the Supreme Court ruled in June that the decision to expand Medicaid is up to the states \u2014 and only 26 states have decided to move forward, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nSo now, people may find themselves in an unfortunate situation: they may not be eligible for Medicaid and they may earn too little to qualify for subsidies on the exchange. More specifically, if you can\u2019t get Medicaid and your income is below 100 percent of the poverty level, you will not be eligible for financial assistance on the exchange. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/10/02/readers-ask-about-subsidies-and-other-health-care-law-provisions/", "id": "t1_ccnb08v", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "RomanNumeralVI", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_ccnblnl", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "naygor", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1nwhcs", "selftext": "So you agree with the ACA to demand that red states turn blue - or that the lack of access to federally subsidized health care will kill lots of the poor in the red states?\n\nNow that sounds a bit harsh, but really that is your point?
