{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Same sex marriage is not \"marriage\" as it has been understood for thousands of years across cultures and continents. A marriage proper is and has always been a union between a man and a woman for the purpose of rearing children. This is a social institution as old as the oldest known civilizations, and never has it been understood to exist between members of the same sex, even in cultures that were far more accepting of homosexuality than we are, e.g., ancient Greece.\n\nSo, having dispatched the notion that we are simply allowing gays to marry, let's go to the heart of the question, which is whether we should change the definition of marriage to be a union between two people of any sex. Let's go back for a moment to the traditional definition of marriage: a union between a man and a woman for the purpose of rearing children. The second half of that definition is important; marriage is not about happiness; it's not about love; it's not about anything other than providing the optimal environment for children to grow up in. Honestly, why would the government have any place in officially recognizing people's love for each other?\n\nGiven that marriage is inseparable from procreation, it does not make much sense to extend it to unions that cannot possibly be procreative. Indeed, barrenness was traditionally one of the only acceptable reasons for divorce. So if we are to change the definition of marriage to include these non-procreative unions, what should the new definition of marriage be? A union between any two people? Can I marry my best friend because we get along well even though neither of us is gay? Why must this union be between two people? Is there any fundamental reason why two is a better number than three? Can I marry more than one person at a time? If not, why not?\n\nOnce you change the definition of marriage to include same-sex unions, you find that almost any restrictions you place on it are arbitrary; in other words, the institution of marriage is evacuated of any meaning.

However, I think it falls apart if you consider adoption or artificial insemination in a modern environment. If, as you say, the states concern is to  provide an optimal environment for children then the argument must be made that a gay couple would be worse parents then a hetero couple. I don't believe there is any legitimate argument that could be made for this outside of a moral standpoint.\n\n You mention that Greece did not have gay marriage but ,at the time, marriage also carried with it the idea of legitimate heirs vs illegitimate children. In a highly patriarchal society, a child conceived without the blessings of the heads of both family's meant an inheritance of wealth to a family line that may have been disapproved of.  Therefore, marriage in this case was also a means of control and reinforced the power structure of the society. \n\nIn other more modern cases, homosexual sex was seen as highly immoral so anyone engaging in such acts would by default be unfit parents. This, I believe, is still the motivating factor in most resistance to gay marriage. I believe you are correct in that marriage still has the primary purpose of a union for the purpose of rearing children. Marriage still creates a large commitment and legal obligations between two people where the separation of such a union is is difficult. This encourages continuous and steady parental figures for children. As gay behavior becomes less taboo then two loving mothers or fathers committed to each would still be better for children then an institutionalized orphanage.", "edited": 1386266019, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdu7iie", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386257862", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t3_1s4g7c", "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1428386979, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1386250167, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1s4g7c", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdu3slp", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386241532", "ups": 4, "distinguished": null}

That is a very valid point of inquiry and really should be investigated more. If Hicks truly was targeted for trying to reveal the truth, then he deserves to be vindicated. However, that again does not imply malice to deceive the american public and more likely implies that a Chief of Staff was furious that someone went behind their back and undermined the authority of their department (which is really what Hicks was doing). It is more plausible to say that the chief of staff was more personally pissed at Hicks then she was receiving orders from on high to punish Hicks. \n\nObama's problem is that he is not exceedingly transparent in these matters and when met with such a hostile market against him, such acts of incompetence are always met with accusations of malice.

This does not imply a criminal cover-up in any sense, but rather a fairly normal operation of any large institution. Essentially, everything about his administration is manipulated, twisted, and used against his administration, that the only way to even maintain a semblance of order is to maintain a strong administration.

Nixon committed crimes in the office of the presidency, lied under oath and was caught. It was right to impeach Nixon.

It was constructed in 2009 in accordance with security standards established by the Diplomatic Security Service at the State Department. The building in Benghazi was basically a villa that was being rented to serve as a temporary consulate. So it was built in accordance with your normal residential security standards for Libya. It was not made to withstand rocket or bomb attacks. So it was not a very secure facility at all.\n\nYou throw 150 guys at a civilian residence, with rockets, grenades, and what not, and it is very likely that someone is going to get killed. What should be noted is the testament to our own security forces that only 4 were killed. \n\nThe truly legitimate questions that should be asked are why weren't troops sent in earlier (mind you they were sent in) and what was the break-down in security that led to missed warning, which there were a few. \n\nTo argue this was preventable is to argue with hindsight and ignore the legitimate difficulties in securing our diplomatic objectives across the globe. There are threats that come in every day, and it is a nightmare of a task deciding what is a credible threat and what is not. \n\nThis was a major failing of the Obama administration on security, one that I am fairly certain was met with rage by the administration internally and one that is being dealt with to fix these issues moving forward. \n\nBut lets not also forget that there were 50+ attacks on our embassies and diplomatic missions under Bush, and we never saw such controversy. And we know for certain that he lied to the American people to get us into war. Those lies are documented.  So when you act like some how Obama is getting a slide by the media please remember the following:\n* News Corp. is the largest media producer in the country when talking about news. Its products reach more consumers than any of the other media outlets. It is not only a part of the MSM, it by definition is the main stream. \n* Obama has been slammed since before he was president by their products, and has not had a day in the 4yrs, 100 days that hes been president, where he wasn't \"utterly destroyed\" by News Corp products.\n* Bush and Cheney, while investigated to some extent, have not had to suffer the same vitriol of congress and the MSM for their actions which led to over 200K people being killed, many who had done no wrong to warrant death by America. \n\nThis idea that somehow Obama has gotten off free about Benghazi is a propaganda'ed mess and is nothing but a fallacy.

As of this time, there has been nothing of substantial merit that has been provided that contradicts the assessment that what happened in the aftermath of Benghazi was completely bungled by the administration.

However, that again does not imply malice to deceive the american public and more likely implies that a Chief of Staff was furious that someone went behind their back and undermined the authority of their department (which is really what Hicks was doing). It is more plausible to say that the chief of staff was more personally pissed at Hicks then she was receiving orders from on high to punish Hicks. \n\nObama's problem is that he is not exceedingly transparent in these matters and when met with such a hostile market against him, such acts of incompetence are always met with accusations of malice. Rather than weaken his office further by explicating the depth of the errors that are made by his office. This does not imply a criminal cover-up in any sense, but rather a fairly normal operation of any large institution. Essentially, everything about his administration is manipulated, twisted, and used against his administration, that the only way to even maintain a semblance of order is to maintain a strong administration.

What should be noted is the testament to our own security forces that only 4 were killed. \n\nThe truly legitimate questions that should be asked are why weren't troops sent in earlier (mind you they were sent in) and what was the break-down in security that led to missed warning, which there were a few. \n\nTo argue this was preventable is to argue with hindsight and ignore the legitimate difficulties in securing our diplomatic objectives across the globe. There are threats that come in every day, and it is a nightmare of a task deciding what is a credible threat and what is not. \n\nThis was a major failing of the Obama administration on security, one that I am fairly certain was met with rage by the administration internally and one that is being dealt with to fix these issues moving forward. \n\nBut lets not also forget that there were 50+ attacks on our embassies and diplomatic missions under Bush, and we never saw such controversy. And we know for certain that he lied to the American people to get us into war. Those lies are documented.  So when you act like some how Obama is getting a slide by the media please remember the following:\n* News Corp. is the largest media producer in the country when talking about news. Its products reach more consumers than any of the other media outlets. It is not only a part of the MSM, it by definition is the main stream. \n* Obama has been slammed since before he was president by their products, and has not had a day in the 4yrs, 100 days that hes been president, where he wasn't \"utterly destroyed\" by News Corp products.\n* Bush and Cheney, while investigated to some extent, have not had to suffer the same vitriol of congress and the MSM for their actions which led to over 200K people being killed, many who had done no wrong to warrant death by America. \n\nThis idea that somehow Obama has gotten off free about Benghazi is a propaganda'ed mess and is nothing but a fallacy.

As of this time, there has been nothing of substantial merit that has been provided that contradicts the assessment that what happened in the aftermath of Benghazi was completely bungled by the administration. Or put another way, there is nothing to suggest that malice is a better assessment than incompetence. \n\nAs for the whistleblower blow-back. That is a very valid point of inquiry and really should be investigated more. If Hicks truly was targeted for trying to reveal the truth, then he deserves to be vindicated. However, that again does not imply malice to deceive the american public and more likely implies that a Chief of Staff was furious that someone went behind their back and undermined the authority of their department (which is really what Hicks was doing). It is more plausible to say that the chief of staff was more personally pissed at Hicks then she was receiving orders from on high to punish Hicks. \n\nObama's problem is that he is not exceedingly transparent in these matters and when met with such a hostile market against him, such acts of incompetence are always met with accusations of malice. Rather than weaken his office further by explicating the depth of the errors that are made by his office. This does not imply a criminal cover-up in any sense, but rather a fairly normal operation of any large institution. Essentially, everything about his administration is manipulated, twisted, and used against his administration, that the only way to even maintain a semblance of order is to maintain a strong administration.

And the only thing that is different is that, after Obama apologized, after Clinton apologized and resigned, after a few other people resigned as well I believe, we are still talking about this issue but with no new information, nothing additional. \n\nNo one is being impeachment charges, no one really seems to be doing anything except scoring cheap political points. \n\nWhats sad is that large swaths of this country are buying the propaganda that this is somehow bigger than actively using the office of the presidency to commit crimes, to cover those crimes up by destroying evidence and lying while under oath. \n\nClinton lied under oath, it was right to bring impeachment charges against him even if they didn't go anywhere. Nixon committed crimes in the office of the presidency, lied under oath and was caught. It was right to impeach Nixon. But no one is making the motion to impeach Obama and no one has provided evidence that Obama either lied under oath, or even real evidence that the state department could have prevented this action.\n\nLet us not forget that it was congress that took funding from the security measures of the diplomatic missions, and let us also not forget that this was not a full embassy that was attacked, which often do not have the same security levels of an embassy.\n\nAccording to PBS(http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2012/09/securing-embassies.html):\n&gt; The embassy in Tripoli is a fairly new facility. It was constructed in 2009 in accordance with security standards established by the Diplomatic Security Service at the State Department. The building in Benghazi was basically a villa that was being rented to serve as a temporary consulate. So it was built in accordance with your normal residential security standards for Libya. It was not made to withstand rocket or bomb attacks. So it was not a very secure facility at all.\n\nYou throw 150 guys at a civilian residence, with rockets, grenades, and what not, and it is very likely that someone is going to get killed. What should be noted is the testament to our own security forces that only 4 were killed. \n\nThe truly legitimate questions that should be asked are why weren't troops sent in earlier (mind you they were sent in) and what was the break-down in security that led to missed warning, which there were a few. \n\nTo argue this was preventable is to argue with hindsight and ignore the legitimate difficulties in securing our diplomatic objectives across the globe. There are threats that come in every day, and it is a nightmare of a task deciding what is a credible threat and what is not. \n\nThis was a major failing of the Obama administration on security, one that I am fairly certain was met with rage by the administration internally and one that is being dealt with to fix these issues moving forward. \n\nBut lets not also forget that there were 50+ attacks on our embassies and diplomatic missions under Bush, and we never saw such controversy. And we know for certain that he lied to the American people to get us into war. Those lies are documented.  So when you act like some how Obama is getting a slide by the media please remember the following:\n* News Corp. is the largest media producer in the country when talking about news. Its products reach more consumers than any of the other media outlets. It is not only a part of the MSM, it by definition is the main stream. \n* Obama has been slammed since before he was president by their products, and has not had a day in the 4yrs, 100 days that hes been president, where he wasn't \"utterly destroyed\" by News Corp products.\n* Bush and Cheney, while investigated to some extent, have not had to suffer the same vitriol of congress and the MSM for their actions which led to over 200K people being killed, many who had done no wrong to warrant death by America. \n\nThis idea that somehow Obama has gotten off free about Benghazi is a propaganda'ed mess and is nothing but a fallacy.

Is it not possible then that the information that the administration was using was the one they believed to be true at the time while also looking into the case of an attack which those initial reports indicated?\n\nThe reason I ask this is because this sounds like a classic case of the Texas sharpshooter fallacy in reasoning. The reports that are still at the front of everyone's minds are those that confirm the truth now, but as was stated over and over in the investigation there were numerous raw reports coming from multiple sources. Had the flip case happened (reports of terror turned out to be wrong, but the admin said it was terror.) Would we also be upset at them? \n\nSomething to note is that this administration has fairly consistently been shy from using terrorist rhetoric about situations that aren't fully investigated, or ascribing such heated value judgments when dealing with foreign security investigations. \n\nThe only issue I have with this whole \"controversy\" is that I, and many, don't get what the issue is that the administration believed it was one thing and found it to be another thing. I don't see that there was a cover-up (and even if there initially was, I'm not sure if there is much controversy in that), but rather an investigation that took place that required time to define fully. \n\nI think that we have to remember the administration is made of humans, and that people who are deliberative and investigative don't necessarily accurate information initially. In the rush for information they made a mistake, they have admitted this mistake, and most of the country has recognized this and moved on. \n\nIn conclusion, I can absolutely come to a conclusion that there is no necessity in your analysis that ascribes malice to the action of the administration.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "This is ludicrous. Marriage has everywhere and always meant one thing - a compact between a man and a woman for the purposes of procreation. Even in cultures that were much, MUCH more tolerant of homosexual behavior than modern America, e.g., Ancient Greece, marriage was only ever thought to be something that could exist between men and women. The notion of marrying another man had all the logic of marrying yourself or your pet dog. There was nowhere a belief that marriage was an expression of love for your partner or anything of the sort. Most of these marriages were arranged, for goodness sake. Indeed in Ancient Rome it was thought fairly strange to be in love with your wife. It was actually something people snickered at. And again, this institution is and has always been about creating the appropriate environment for the rearing of children. Traditionally one of the few acceptable grounds for annulment was infertility.\n\nSo let's rid ourselves of the idea that there is some limitation that has been discriminatately imposed on gays. Gays have never been barred from entering into a marriage proper. What is now being demanded is that we CHANGE the meaning of the word marriage to mean something that it has never meant. Presumably it now means something that two (why only two?) people (why only people?) do to express their love for each other until such time as they no longer love each other at which point they can divorce. Why the state has any role to play in legally recognizing two people's feelings for each other is beyond me, and frankly beyond you.\n\nSo lets examine why it might be a bad idea to change the definition of marriage. (Here I am being generous, since the burden of proof should properly be on those who are seeking a change from the status quo.) Well, one reason might be that a two parent opposite sex household is intrinsically appropriate for rearing children. When you look at any statistics on outcomes for children of divorced parents or children of single mothers, you inevitably come to the conclusion that two parents are better than one. Now, is this good brought about by the fact that the number of parents has increased, or is there something about having both a mother and a father that is necessary for normative development? If the former, we should advocate polygamy, shouldn't we? After all, if two parents are good, three must be better! But if, as I suspect, the good come from having both a mother and a father present, then a \"gay marriage\" is quite possibly a bad arrangement for the rearing of children.\n\nLets examine that possibility. The very, very few studies that have been done on outcomes for children raised in homosexual households suggest that children do even better in these types of arrangements than most children. That's all well and good until you consider that their sample consists almost exclusively of highly stable, highly wealthy, highly educated households and is compared to the national average. These studies are meaningless.\n\nIt might also have a harmful effect on the institution of marriage as a whole. After all, if the meaning of the institution changes so readily under political pressure, does it have any meaning at all? What does it mean to be married, other than to have a document stamped by the government stating something to that effect?\n\nWhat is the justification for denying polygamous couples the right to marry? What about incestuous couples? If marriage is only about expressing love, surely it's appropriate to extend it to these classes of people too. Or are they incapable of love? And with respect to love, once it is gone, are they now divorced de facto, or does the legal recognition of the marriage endure? If it does endure, doesn't this imply that love is not required for marriage, and that it should be open to people of any relationship? Can I marry my best friend? I really like him! Can't children marry each other if they get along, then divorce if they have a fight?\n\nThe fact is that marriage is not about love, but about preparing for the consequences of procreative sex. It is something that men and women enter into because doing so receives social approbation (and not doing so is scorned,) and that social approbation exists because the institution of marriage as it has always been understood is a known social good.\n\nTotally invalid, or slightly more thought out than you were hoping?\n\nEDIT: Folks, no disagreement downvotes.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "well I would say marriages pre-modern era were not as much about love as they are today.
