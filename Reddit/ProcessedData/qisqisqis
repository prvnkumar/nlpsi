That's a very unfair question. If you're extremely poor, you might not have a car, or a home to yourself, or your own bedroom, or even any rooms at all. You may not know where your next meal will come from, or if you can afford to keep the lights on, or fill the heating-oil, or clothe your children. What if you're only \"kinda poor\" and you can afford to heat your home and feed your kids, but you can't afford to give them a gift on their birthday, or $20 bucks to see a movie with their friends, or a new pair of cool sneakers. Social success as an adolescent is determined by your peers. And poor kids get shit on constantly. Poverty is real and growing in this country. It's a major problem and you have to be completely isolated or uncaring not to notice it. And the gratuitous and unapologetic displays of enormous wealth in this country is the worst slap in the face to someone who \"can't afford it\". We have more money, more food, and more power than any other nation in the world, yet somehow providing a standard quality of life that makes sure people have the basic necessities is a topic of debate.\n\n&gt;roughly 2% of full-time workers earn the minimum wage\n\nYes, but the article also states that that 2% makes exactly the minimum wage. Hey, I make 10 cents an hour over minimum wage. Congratulations to me, I'm no longer part of that stat, but I'm still poor as fuck.\n\n&gt;Only 11%\n\nThat's millions of people. How can you treat that number as if it's insignificant? As a CPA, is 11% ever an insignificant figure? Again, I make just above minimum wage, and I'm still poor as shit. I don't have kids either, and I live in Boston. It's expensive to live here. I'm not a part of that stat, but still poor, and I don't have the smarts or the skills for a higher paying job. What's my path to a better life?\n\n&gt;employers can pay less, but employees can demand less as well. If you know you can get food stamps, you might ask for a lower wage (even if higher than minimum wage) in order to undercut any competition for that position\n\nThis is just fucked. You're looking at a poor person trying to get a job as a strategic maneuver to get more money out of the government and \"cut out\" his competition. There's plenty of information about people who have said that they take a lower wage to keep government assistance because their \"higher wage\" would disqualify them from assistance, but not be enough to make up for the loss. Do you actually believe that's an individual problem and not systemic? What if you live in a region that has a high living expense, like New York, Boston, San Fran, or LA? Society needs people at all levels to function and you can't tell people to simply \"move\" or \"get a better job\" when living expenses are high and opportunity is low.\n\nYour apparent lack of sympathy for poor people is disturbing to me, but I can see how you would place higher value on business profit, being a CPA and all.\n\nCorporate profits are higher than ever. The market is performing as well as ever, and more people are becoming poor now than in many past decades and major corporations employee the majority of the labor force. People should be paid more, and that's pretty much the end of it. It's an ethical difference between putting profits or people first.

Its why I worked so damn hard so that my own children will never know what it is like to beg, and I mean beg, for a 50 cent piece of candy while my mom is trying to figure out what groceries to put back because we can't afford everything she had wanted to get for us that week.\n\n&gt; Social success as an adolescent is determined by your peers. And poor kids get shit on constantly. Poverty is real and growing in this country. It's a major problem and you have to be completely isolated or uncaring not to notice it.\n\nI do notice it.  And I do care.  But doing something that is going to further create a underclass is *not* the way to handle it.  Shouldn't minimum wage help the poorest and least educated among us?  Take a look at the unemployment rates for those without high school degrees and, to even accent it more, minorities without high school degrees.  Want to know how to almost be guaranteed to be unemployed?  Be [young, black](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t02.htm) (32% unemployment, just by race) and [without a high school diploma](http://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cpseea05.htm) (10%, just by educational attainment).  So whatever we're doing now - its not really working.  And so to drive up the cost by making those currently making minimum wage compete against those making just above it (congrats!) means that those jobs are going to go to those who would be making just above it.\n\n&gt;you can't tell people to simply \"move\" or \"get a better job\" when living expenses are high and opportunity is low.\n\nSo instead we're just going to step aside and talking about a lot of superlative ways that we're going to make life better for them, as part of a \"War on Poverty\"?  I've listened to politicians say how that they understand the blight of my community, of how the black man faces this and that.  Guess what... I didn't get out by waiting for Mr. Politician to do something for me.  I got out by saying \"F*** you\" to those who said I would be nothing better than another piece of black trash from New Orleans and made something of myself.\n\n&gt;Your apparent lack of sympathy for poor people is disturbing to me, but I can see how you would place higher value on business profit, being a CPA and all.\n\nIts sad that you cannot understand that \"business profit\" is no different than someone trying to save money.  When was the last time you paid $2 for a $1 candy bar?  Or told the waiter \"You know, I'll pay $20 for this $10 burrito.  Because I think that I'm not caring enough to just take what you're offering it for.\"  Asking a business to pay more than what something is worth to them - whether capital or labor - is like asking you to pay me more than what my CPA services are to you.\n\n&gt;It's an ethical difference between putting profits or people first.\n\nIronically, there is not really a difference if you put aside the political BS.  Do you know how many times I've been called Oreo because I got my education?  Or that I didn't put my \"race\" first and hire a less qualified black man instead of the more qualified woman?  Or the fact that because I married a white woman from Ukraine I'm somehow less of a black man.  Too often we as a society try to divide ourselves instead of understanding there is one basic rule that works for all of economics - you will only pay what you think something is worth.

A police officer was severely injured in the line of duty, shot multiple times, lost and eye, spent two.5 years in recovery, and can no longer perform his duty as an officer. He is disabled and no one argues that. The debate is in the amount of disability benefits and goes as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On one side of the debate we have the mayor, city retirement board, and their local supporters. The board and the mayor proposed 100% pay until age 65, 80% for life after that. Also there are very generous medical expenses paid by the city, plus many other provisions that are highlighted in &lt;a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/regionals/north/2013/06/12/woburn-officer-injured-shooting-may-receive-enhanced-retirement-plan-head-here-please-extra-benefits-pushed-for-injured-officer/nnuxiHjOOzaih3AM8in6xJ/story.html\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also the details of the package are public and on the city&amp;#39;s website. The website is pretty bad so I&amp;#39;m still searching for the original package. I will post it as soon as I find it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the issue is the city council, the family of the officer, the officer himself, and local supporters.

I have a two part question for you. The first part is government policy/how to run a city, the second part is opinion-based, which you can choose to ignore, if you wish.\n\nbackground:\n\nIn my city we're having a heated debate between the mayor's administration and the city council. A police officer was severely injured in the line of duty, shot multiple times, lost and eye, spent two.5 years in recovery, and can no longer perform his duty as an officer. He is disabled and no one argues that. The debate is in the amount of disability benefits and goes as follows:\n\nOn one side of the debate we have the mayor, city retirement board, and their local supporters. The board and the mayor proposed 100% pay until age 65, 80% for life after that. Also there are very generous medical expenses paid by the city, plus many other provisions that are highlighted in [this](http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/regionals/north/2013/06/12/woburn-officer-injured-shooting-may-receive-enhanced-retirement-plan-head-here-please-extra-benefits-pushed-for-injured-officer/nnuxiHjOOzaih3AM8in6xJ/story.html) article.\n\nAlso the details of the package are public and on the city's website. The website is pretty bad so I'm still searching for the original package. I will post it as soon as I find it.\n\nOn the other side of the issue is the city council, the family of the officer, the officer himself, and local supporters. I suspect union involvement simply because he is a police officer that belongs to the union. I can't imagine being a police union member and getting no support in this type of circumstance. Anyway the only thing different is they want 100% pay for life. Everything else about the disability package remains unchanged.\n\nMy first question:\n\nIs there a real political/financial/precedent challenges with making and exception like this, given that the city is in very good financial health, and officers pay into the state retirement system? Do contributors technically \"own\" the money, giving them more say in how it's distributed (ie. with increased an exceptional disability benefits)?

I'm not sure that your question can even have an honest answer when you frame the debate in this way. I'll give it a shot though.\n\nFirst and foremost, Iran does indeed have nuclear engineers, scholars, authors, and philosophers, of which many were educated in US universities and other Western institutions before 1979. They also have many universities, but with Israel and the US conducting clandestine sabotage of engineering and governmental facilities, they have major setbacks. They also develop their own defensive weapons systems (a defensive doctrine, in fact, codified after being invaded by Iraq\u2014backed by the US\u2014in 1980) such as long, medium, and short-range missiles, small arms, tanks, etc. Remember their weapons are for a defensive military doctrine. They do not make war like the US and Europe. They have not yet, to this date, threatened invasion or military action against any nation since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. The US cannot say this for itself when it threatens and conducts wars of aggression in the Middle East, as it has all over the world for nearly 300 years.\n\nI don't know much about Iran's space-based technology, but I imagine they have some sort of developing plan.\n\nIn short, Iran is a highly independent nation unwilling to submit to Western domination in the Middle East. They booted the US government out in 1979, defeated Iraq in the 1980s at enormous cost to their population, follow a defensive military doctrine, hold democratic elections, and also have a strong and developing scientific community.

In many other countries and regions that aren't industrialized, you can be \"poor\" and still support yourself and your family because you can own land cheaply, farm your own food, and develop an entirely different set of survival skills. Is it glamorous? No. Is it easy? Hell no. But our economic model is imposed on all our citizens with very little choice, and land ownership and autonomy don't exist unless you have capital to build on. I believe it's important to make sure the most vulnerable people in our society are afforded the means for decent survival. What are the means to that end? Higher wages? More Social Security? Less? Universal healthcare? Cheaper college education? All the above? It's up for debate. But if we want to keep capitalism, we have to realize that most people won't be rich. But those who \"make it\" have a responsibility to maintain a decent ~~society~~ standard of living for all citizens. Seeing as the most successful individuals and corporations make most of the rules in the USA, it comes with a great responsibility to avoid oppressing the population. It's simply the right thing to do.", "id": "t1_ccauxfk", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "qisqisqis", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1mlzky", "selftext": "Excellent answer.

The UK has a population density of 673/sq mile, compared to the US's 89. So in the 10 mile radius around a hospital, the UK has 211500 citizens vs 28000 in the US. The hospital with only 28 bed still needs the equipment available to deal with most of the same diseases as the large hospital, but much of it will only be used occationally, or for a handful of patients. \n\nObviously, there are limits.

But FREEDOM is the real counter argument to that notion.\n\nWhat? That's a huge load of bullshit. Since when is big government, control, and oppression relegated to Communism and Socialism, other than in mass state propaganda? The oppression of the US Federal government against its population is blatantly obvious in history and communism had nothing to do with that. In fact capitalism is hugely destructive to populations. Look at the labor history of the US. It's so violent it's almost incredible. \n\nThere is no doubt that Soviet Russia was a horrible place. But Socialism in Soviet Russia was certainly a hoax. Read Marx and then look at how the Soviet Union treated its people. It wasn't socialism. It was a brutal and oppressive state. Period. Egalitarian enforcement only existed for the oppressed, not the opulent masters. It was a hypocrisy, just as hypocrisy thrives within capitalism and the US government.\n\n&gt;Free market capitalism is not exactly related to \"right-wing\". It's just that many think right-wing = rich, big business, etc. However, many very wealthy are liberals, e.g. Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, all the major network TV anchors, most hollywood actors, etc\n\nThis statement simply exacerbates the confusion of what left and right really mean in historical terms. Buffet, Gates et al are neo-liberals, not leftists. They're still far to the right of the historical left, but we cannot even have that conversation in the mainstream because the nation has been pushed so far to the right over the last 40 years. You can't talk about labor unions. You can't talk redistributed wealth. You can't talk about anything even remotely leftist in this country without self-marginalization. The propaganda is too strong.\n\nLastly, OP asked for books, not diatribe about why socialist ideals are bad or good.

That's evident in major legislation where average people are losing homes, losing jobs, losing benefits, losing public assistance, earning low wages, and paying for expensive utilities; while corporations and billionaires nearly tanked the economy, drive to privatize everything, destroy the environment, capture regulatory agencies, write their own laws, perpetuate consumerism, buy elections, hate democracy, plunder the earth, and get bailed out and protected for all of it every step of the way.\n\nThere is no middle class. It's either have or have not. And as the gap widens, populations will become more oppressed and eventually will act against the masters.

The Taliban arose out of the Pashtun south, and though they absorbed former militants, had a unique and different ideology. We didn't arm them, but they acquired left over weapons. Freedom was not introduced because we simply helped the Afghans repulse a Soviet invasion. A socialist government was still in place until toppled by warring warlords. That wasn't freedom. \n\nSo yes, everything I have said is predicated on fact. If you would like, I will start listing references. I'll begin by listing Ghost Wars by Steve Coll, which won a Pulitzer in 2005 for establishing a narrative of U.S. policy towards Afghanistan between the 1980's and 2001.

The existence of a debate that few in the mainstream pay attention to is not the same as their being no debate. Rather, this debate has taken place within think tanks, congressional hearings, DoD planning offices, intelligence agencies, and diplomatic offices in Washington, D.C. and many other places. The American public, by and large, just doesn't give a damn. \n\nSecond, \"the wrong hands\" is a general statement, but it means jihadists. Jabhat al-Nusra is a faction that is al-Qa'ida affiliated and essentially comprised of fighters who earned their skills killing Americans and Iraqi security forces. Several Salafist groups, religious hardliners, have likewise rejected cooperation with more moderate or secular groups  because they have a very different view of what a post-Assad Syria looks like. These groups are interested in a parochial vision, and thus are not compatible with American interests or those of a large swatch of Syrians. \n\nThird, OP referenced the video of the the commander of the Faruq brigade eating the lung of his enemy. That video has been confirmed as real. This is where sensational and graphic images can shock public opinion, but obscure facts on the ground. What he did was barbaric, and he was instantly condemned, and now wanted, by most opposition groups because that is abhorrent behavior to them as well. Though it is easy for us to be outraged over here, I doubt every single one of us would remain sane when subject to two years of terror and atrocity. He does not represent the entire opposition.\n\nBuilding on the previous point, the longer the conflict rages, the more depraved things will get. Jihadists and Salafists are tapped into international networks for arms and funds because of their ties to other militant groups or religious networks, respectively. This makes them more effective than moderate groups, which in turns attracts recruits who would not normally be attracted to fundamentalism. This is thus creating a race against time whereby the longer the conflict burns, the greater the number of increasingly extremist militants will be left in Syria. They will either exacerbate the difficulties of piecing Syria back together again, or may go involve themselves in jihads elsewhere. \n\nFourth, since Assad's government is supported by Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah, and the hardliners/extremists are supported through their networks, that really leaves the groups most conducive to a Syria able to integrate into the region and work with most countries out in the cold. Arming these groups gives them a chance to contradict the above trend. \n\n\"Peace\" is not the goal, nor is it realistic given Assad's rejection of every proposal neighbors or the UN have put forward. And a peace where the status quo favors extremist groups would do little more than turn Syria into a ticking time bomb of fanaticism. This is a battle for Syria's soul, and that has grave implications for the future of the Middle East. On the whole, I am incredulous that this is often over-looked. \n\nNow that I think I have made the case for \"do something rather than nothing\", OP's points about the difficulties of action are spot on. Giving weapons to unaccountable groups and not keeping tabs on them is likely to create negative consequences down the road. If you read into this, the term \"vetted\" is constantly thrown around to describe background checks into the nature, goals, and affiliations of any group we'd supply. Yet no matter how \"vetted\" a group is, there exist rivalries and battlefield conditions where assistance may wind up in the hands of non-desirables. And the largest determinant of what happens is whether the U.S. stays involved. A panelist at an event I was at earlier in the week used the phrase \"we own it\" to describe the outcome of supplying arms to rebel groups in regards to the post-conflict. We owned Afghanistan '91 and just abandoned it, allowing the Taliban to set up shop. Aid would require a long-term  commitment. \n\nPolicy-making is often choosing the least terrible from among the terrible options. The U.S. doesn't have many options on Syria, and anything action taken is going to be difficult and risky. The \"right\" policy is hard. If security decisions were easy, we wouldn't make what are, in hindsight, mistakes nearly so often. We don't even know what Syria will look like at the end of everything.

Everything \"interesting\" that was released is stuff you'd learn in undergraduate Political Science. That doesn't mean that the release was harmless, though. One example is a few memos between China and the US that show that China doesn't support North Korea as much as they say publicly. While it's true that everyone with an education already knows this, the release of the cables amounts to a public declaration of no confidence in the North Korean regime by China. This has a destabilizing effect on the region due to the Kim regime's dependence on Chinese deterrence as a large portion of their foreign policy. It makes them less predictable and more likely to do something irrational if they believe that they are alone against the world.\n\nIt also destroys confidence in American diplomats, because a breach in security means that people don't have the luxury of speaking candidly anymore for risk of angering other parties should it get out. As much as conspiracy theorists like Julian Assange might think this is a good thing (his ideology is that everything spoken in secret is necessarily detrimental to society), it really hurts people's ability to negotiate and therefore makes conflict more likely.\n\nThe public doesn't need to know that the ambassador to Canada thinks a local soap opera has anti-American undertones or that the ambassador to Cambodia isn't a fan of the local cuisine. These kinds of things make up the majority of the cables. These personal anecdotes can be useful to analysts and can harm the individual diplomat's relations with people within the country if they get out (some people are really proud of their food). Diplomats need to feel comfortable sharing their insights without fear of risking their job for saying something that could be interpreted as politically incorrect.\n\nTransparency can be important, but international diplomacy is not a good place to start forcing it. The release of these documents was largely destructive to the foreign policy of the United States and several other countries. This is not because it revealed something embarrassing or evil that was happening, but because it hindered communication with the global hegemon.\n\nIf you want to understand how diplomacy and intelligence actually work (not like the movies), [Mark Lowenthal](http://www.amazon.com/Intelligence-Secrets-Policy-Mark-Lowenthal/dp/1608716759) is a great source and basically required reading for anyone going into that field.", "id": "t1_cac55uy", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Volsunga", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1fnkf4", "selftext": "IIRC, another example of a potential harm was that it was revealed more explicitly that Saudi Arabia was very concerned about Iran's nuclear weapons program and hinted at starting their own if things got too hot.

But when said out loud it can cause problems in relations.\n\nAnother problem, and it became part of the meta-debate about publishing WikiLeaks stuff in general, is that there were names of translators and sources in places like Afghanistan and Iraq.

The reason that employers get a better deal is that they get group-rates which spread the risk/cost around.\n\nIf we were to offer cafeteria plans, where people choose whether they want just basic catastrophic care (essentially current-day HDHP/HSAs) and then \"buy\" packages that extend coverage, you would see prices drop.  Right now, the insurance I have covers me if I ever get pregnant.  If that happens, I won't need insurance as I'd be the first male pregnancy.  But its done this way to keep costs down for women who really *do* need the coverage for the two or three times its actually needed.  But even after menopause, when they realistically no longer need it, they *still* pay for that coverage.\n\nThe biggest reason health insurance costs as much as it does has more to do with what it covers than anything else.  All insurance is basically risk-based pricing: take condition A, estimate the cost of treatment times the cost of an individual acquiring that condition.  Then do the same with Condition B, C, D... etc.  That's how you roughly calculate the cost of the premium.

But I think you're missing some important factors in the cost of healthcare: hospital profit and insurance investor profit. Hospitals charge insane amounts of money for cheap things like toilet paper, tylenol, and very crappy food (think of it like the $1000 toilet seat story from the military). Of course like any business, they have overhead. But I don't see the justification that clearly. And insurance investor profit, in my opinion, works like any other for-profit corporation in that they maximize profit to keep investors happy.

Germany had ample cause to see American complicity to the Allied blockade on trade with Germany (while still continuing trade of munitions with Allied forces) as declaring loyalty to one side over the other in violation of neutrality.

But he did a lot of things to provoke Germany too (like sinking German U-boats).  Back to Wilson though, he also demanded that the Germans not sink ANY trade ships, even if they suspected they were trading munitions and even if they weren't American.  Kind of a strange demand from Mr. Peace, no?\n\nAs with FDR, Wilson going to war in 1914 would have been political suicide.

Your argument rests on a mistaken view on consistency. You think that just because we made one choice about alcohol, allowing it, we have to make a similar choice about heroin. But we didn't make a choice about alcohol thinking that it was good for people or that the harm was OK because of the benefits or anything like that.

There is, of course, more use of marijuana than heroin because of the lethality of heroin, but that is no admission that use of harder drugs won't increase with legalization. Of course they will. Will there be a giant surge of use? I'm not sure how much of an increase there will be, but there will be one. More people will die.

If we allow Marijuana then how long will it take until we get to allowing heroin? The first thing people point out is that there is a huge difference between Marijuana and Heroin and therefore the slope is too steep to allow any inference making. However, there are a number of drugs in between Marijuana and heroin one could see as stepping stones to getting there. For instance, there are a number of diet pills that currently require a prescription because they contain fairly hard core amphetamines. Well, what's the difference between allowing me to chill out using marijuana and allowing me to get something accomplished using phentermine, or get an A+ using adderall? And once we make the amphetamines over the counter why are we still jailing people for coke? The point is just that one can see how we get into some worrisome territory if we go down this road too far. That's not to say that we will go too far down it, we can stop, but it is important to think about where to stop before we get too far. \n\n", "edited": 1360085627, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_17xsn7", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c89tex6", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1360085445", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c89tnfd", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Good point.
