I bring this up for a reason. It was the first time since the establishment of what we would currently call supreme sovereign nations that they volunteered to relinquish an aspect of that sovereignty because they felt uniform rules for governing those vital and multinational rivers was more important than supreme sovereignty. Before this each nation had their own standards and it would cause colisions and chaos as each captain played by different rules. No one nation could set uniform rules because the problem was larger than any one nation.\n\nFast forward to today and you will see even more issues that go beyond any one state. International entities feeds off the regulatory arbitrage that is created by each nation having different standards. It allows for tax havens. It makes regulating pollution or fishing limits impossible. It makes transnational militias like Al Qaeda capable of exploiting holes in global reach to evade international justice. I don't see these problems going away, infact with technology and continuing increases in global trade and travel I only see them intensifying. I don't think that means one world government by any stretch, but I absolutely see a continued, voluntary surrender of some parts of national sovereignty to address trans-national issues.\n\nNational sovereignty also can slow trade, which is bad for both sides. Differing national standards for safety, testing, quality control among others made shipping products between countries more expensive than it needed to be. That's why the EU started as the ECC and began, before everything else, to standardize requirements to make intra-European trade less costly. This applies to people as well. If Google has a smart guy working in the US, and wants his talent at one of the other dozens of countries where they have offices, depending on the country this can be a long expensive process. Nations agreeing to suspend independent rule-making, suspend the use of tariffs and make migration easier (as the EU and to a lesser extent NAFTA has done) that benefits all nations involved. That is another force bringing nations together rather than apart.\n\nSure there are plenty of forces trying to separate nations as they now exist, but there always have been. What is changing (and is likely to continue to change) is an intensified pressure to conform to global standards which requires surrendering parts of one's national sovereignty.

Whenever another country has *their* rate of interest significantly different there are market forces that try to get it back to rough equality with the US's rate.

If people start to have doubts, if people don't see it as a sure thing, bonds aren't going to sell as well. At least not at that price, the US may have to raise interest rates in order to make up for a perceived jump in risk. That means any line of credit, any loan around the world will be affected. Everyone will be paying more interest and the economy would slow down leading to a jump in unemployment.\n\nThe US dollar is also the world's most used currency by a very wide margin. It is used in roughly half of all international trade as an intermediary currency. It is used to set commodity prices worldwide. And that is in addition to being the currency of the largest economy in the world that includes roughly 19% of the world's economic activity.

Understand the law is different than you think.\n\nAny law, statute or action is the law of the land until such time as a court finds it unconstitutional. That is literally how the constitution says laws are to be passed (not to mention that the constitution *doesn't* explicitly give the Supreme Court or *any* court the power to strike down laws). I personally consider that starting each day with a religious prayer is a violation of the establishment clause of the first amendment, but until such time as a court agrees I can not go around calling that action unconstitutional.\n\nIf you go back to my post, I too quote the 4th amendment, and the part that is most important is \"The right of the people to be secure in **their** persons...\". If something is not yours, your permission is not needed to search it. *Your* papers and affects are not being searched because Facebook, Google and ISP web data are not *yours* to begin with. This is especially true because Google and Facebook (and most sites) keep a copy of the correspondence themselves, eliminating any expectation of privacy since you do not have the only copy. If you are to argue an email to be your property no one else may have a copy, that is not the case unless you programmed your own e-mail server. \n\nAdditionally, there is a big difference between warrantless archiving and warrantless searching. The fact that they don't read that copy makes all the difference in the world. It is neither a search nor a seizure to have an unread copy. And unless *your only copy* is taken it is not a seizure, just as taking a photograph of your car is not a seizure of your car. \n\nJust last year the Supreme Court decided a case, *United States v. Jones* where police without a warrant put a GPS tracker on a suspect's car. They ruled that was unconstitutional but *only* because it was physically attached to his property (his car). In the text of the decision they were clear that this was the only reason it needed a warrant, that if they used some other means that did not violate the sanctity of the suspect's property (such as tracking the GPS location on his phone) it would not violate security of property and would not be an unreasonable search, and so it would be allowed. You may disagree but that is the view of the court and therefore the US government. \n\nAnd again, look at the 1979 case *Smith v. Maryland* that I mentioned earlier. The court ruled that copying call history was not a search. That information was the property of the phone company and it was being recorded regardless so the expectation of privacy established in *Katz* does not apply. The combination of not being the suspect's property *and* that they information was being copied by others already is what made that constitutional. \n\nI can respect you saying your not a lawyer, but then do not ask a question and insist that your reading of law is both obvious and more correct than the answer provided. I want to make it clear I don't approve of the NSA's program, but from a constitutional standpoint the case against them is neither obvious nor clear.

In rough order of importance you need: an organized political group, a clear goal, and general popular support. The support is there, but it's the least important. After all, 90% of the country approved of universal background checks, but that wasn't enough to overcome the eminence organizational power of the NRA. \n\nThere is not a lot of mobilizing, and the goal is not clear mostly because there is a great deal of misinformation about what the NSA is actually doing. People think they are listening to every phone call and reading every e-mail, they only ~~collect~~ read metadata without a warrant and need a warrant for anything more than that. So when people say they need to \"stop listening in on everyone's phone calls\" that's not a good sign since they never started that. \n\nAs to the constitutionality, there's nothing clear in the constitution or case history to say this program is illegal. The constitution after all gives no explicit promise of privacy, only that you will be \"secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures\". I hate to break it to you, but you don't own your g-mail metadata, that is not your property it is Google's property. You don't have a right against search for things that are not yours.\n\nSome other case history: Over 100 years ago a case came to the Supreme Court that involved police recieving records from the post office about who a suspect was mailing. They did not open the mail, and the post office *has* to make note of where the letter needs to be delivered so they ruled that the police did not need a warrant to monitor that. That was essentially mail metadata.\n\nIn 1979 the police monitored call logs of a suspect, who he was calling and for how long. They did not listen to the conversation. The court found they did not need a warrant in large part because (a) that information belonged to AT&amp;T who were cooperating, (b) that information needed to be logged for billing purposes anyway. Therefore since the suspect did not owned the information, *and* he knew it was being written down by the phone company, he did not have an expectation of privacy and the police did not need a warrant. That was essentially phone metadata.\n\nSo now we come to the information age and surprise, there's more information available to log. But legally, logging who sent texts or e-mails to who is no different than the AT&amp;T case *or* the case with the post office. Either way (a) you don't own the information and (b) you know it's being recorded elsewhere. From a constitutional standpoint there's over a hundred years of case law to back this up, and nothing in the constitution to ban it. The only reason why this seems so much worse is that there is simply so much more information to gather.\n\nIf you want it changed it isn't likely going to come from the courts. For things to change there needs to be either a privacy amendment to the constitution or for congress to prohibit it by law. The amendment is a more permanent fix (and will fix future issues to come since privacy is not an explicit right in the constitution) but it could literally take a decade+ to achieve.\n\nEdit for clarity", "id": "t1_ccm1hu3", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "auandi", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_ccm2pi7", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "quintus_horatius", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I appologize for being unclear.

Understand the law is different than you think.\n\nAny law, statute or action is the law of the land until such time as a court finds it unconstitutional. That is literally how the constitution says laws are to be passed (not to mention that the constitution *doesn't* explicitly give the Supreme Court or *any* court the power to strike down laws). I personally consider that starting each day with a religious prayer is a violation of the establishment clause of the first amendment, but until such time as a court agrees I can not go around calling that action unconstitutional.\n\nIf you go back to my post, I too quote the 4th amendment, and the part that is most important is \"The right of the people to be secure in **their** persons...\". If something is not yours, your permission is not needed to search it. *Your* papers and affects are not being searched because Facebook, Google and ISP web data are not *yours* to begin with. This is especially true because Google and Facebook (and most sites) keep a copy of the correspondence themselves, eliminating any expectation of privacy since you do not have the only copy. If you are to argue an email to be your property no one else may have a copy, that is not the case unless you programmed your own e-mail server. \n\nAdditionally, there is a big difference between warrantless archiving and warrantless searching. The fact that they don't read that copy makes all the difference in the world. It is neither a search nor a seizure to have an unread copy. And unless *your only copy* is taken it is not a seizure, just as taking a photograph of your car is not a seizure of your car. \n\nJust last year the Supreme Court decided a case, *United States v. Jones* where police without a warrant put a GPS tracker on a suspect's car. They ruled that was unconstitutional but *only* because it was physically attached to his property (his car). In the text of the decision they were clear that this was the only reason it needed a warrant, that if they used some other means that did not violate the sanctity of the suspect's property (such as tracking the GPS location on his phone) it would not violate security of property and would not be an unreasonable search, and so it would be allowed. You may disagree but that is the view of the court and therefore the US government. \n\nAnd again, look at the 1979 case *Smith v. Maryland* that I mentioned earlier. The court ruled that copying call history was not a search. That information was the property of the phone company and it was being recorded regardless so the expectation of privacy established in *Katz* does not apply. The combination of not being the suspect's property *and* that they information was being copied by others already is what made that constitutional. \n\nI can respect you saying your not a lawyer, but then do not ask a question and insist that your reading of law is both obvious and more correct than the answer provided. I want to make it clear I don't approve of the NSA's program, but from a constitutional standpoint the case against them is neither obvious nor clear. The constitution alone, as it is written, does not prohibit the NSA's actions.

It is impossible for both the Constitution and a law violating it to be valid; one must prevail.\" [SOURCE](http://www.constitution.org/uslaw/16amjur2nd.htm) and as far as I know the Supreme Court has not made an official ruling on MUCH or even MOST of what the NSA is doing (partially because it is all done in secret). This leads me to the Constitutionality of these programs. Remember what we know is only what has been leaked or what has been revealed, the scope of these programs are still largely unknown. I probably do not need to quote the 4th Amendment, but I will anyway:\n\n\"The right of the people to be secure in their *persons, houses, papers, and effects*, against **unreasonable searches and seizures**, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\"    \n\nI think it is fairly clear to say without too much conjecture that my papers and effects are being violated by NSA programs. /u/quintus_horatius pointed out revelations by Mark Klein that basically ALL internet traffic is being funneled and stored for an [unknown] amount of time. This is clearly a voilation of the security of my papers and effects. If I send an email (paper) to a private party over the internet, it is no longer secure per the 4th Amendment, as the NSA has a copy. They don't necessarily *read* that copy, but they can, and therein lies the problem. It is quite simply, not secure, and I have been searched and my property seized, unreasonably.     \nIn addition, apparently even the FISA courts have released an opinion questioning the Constitutionality/legality of the NSA programs. [SOURCE](http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/national/fisa-court-documents-on-illegal-nsa-e-mail-collection-program/409/) With these kind of revelations coming to light, I really do not understand why these programs are not immediately struck down.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1nofya", "selftext": "First, (assuming you aren't American) the most important thing about Republicans and Democrats is that they are not ideologically unified the way a parliamentary system has unified parties. They are \"big tent\" parties with multiple \"wings\" that have a loose coalition that is mutually beneficial to all involved.\n\nDemocrats *tend* to be more liberal, but a Republican form Connecticut will usually be *much* more liberal than a Democrat from Texas.\n\nThat is why third parties in the US have never had almost any power since the Civil War when the two big tent parties solidified. When a new \"movement\" starts to happen, rather than start a new party they join one of the two existing parties, which shortcuts them into a position of power they wouldn't have as a third party. \n\nLibertarian, Green, American Independent, all these third parties look more often than not like large rounding errors not true opposition. This is especially true the further \"down ticket\" (less important positions) you go, there have been prominent third party presidential candidates, but very rarely Senators/Governors and almost never House members. Oddly though, you get far enough down ticket (mayor/city council) and third parties start having a better chance since they usually have to appeal to so few voters.\n\nAn example from history:\n\nAt the start of the Progressive movement, people at first tried to form a People's Party in the 1890's. It had a good deal of support. But in 1896 after seeing how popular the movement was, the Republican Party began to adopt progressive policies and nominated a progressive as their Vice President. The People's Party soon collapsed, after all a VP slot is better than what they would likely have been able to accomplish that year. Why be a minor third party when you can be a *part* of a governing party? Having a seat at the table is easier when joining the parties already seated there. This formed the Progressive wing of the Republican Party, and that lead to a Progressive Republican President and the implementation of many progressive ideas like the FDA. \n\nSure the Republicans were *also* pro-business, something at complete odds with the anti-monopoly progressives, but for a time they *both* existed in the Republican Party. \n\nTo put this another way: In a parliament with many parties (4+) there are elections and then a governing coalition is formed to make a majority. In the US the coalition happens before the election, with many movements (sometimes at odds with each other) sharing the same name and supporting each other in a way \"pure\" political parties do not.", "id": "t1_cckig6d", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "auandi", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1nofya", "selftext": "However, parties have killed other parties when their discourse and ideology becomes unsustainable.

We have faced much more challenging times in our history and come out the other end, there's nothing especially more threatening now than in the past century. \n\nThroughout history the most common kind of collapse was invasion from abroad, that isn't likely. Canada and Mexico are the only ones that share a boarder, and neither are willing nor capable to try. And you can forget navel invasion, the US navy is larger than the rest of the world's active navies combined *before* you account for our sonar nets and advanced weaponry. So no collapse through invasion.\n\nWhat about uprising? Well you're going to face a similar problem. The US is too powerful to be overthrown, particularly because once you turn violent you tend to loose most of the support your group might have had. Secession is also not likely, there may be antagonism between some states and the Federal government, but nothing close to the scale needed for states to attempt succession. So no collapse through internal uprising.\n\nWhat about general internal rot? Well that's a little harder to nail down. While it played a large part in the collapse of other nations, it usually only played the part of softening them up for invasion. The few that implode into a failed state without invasion are usually living under extraordinary circumstances. The government would have to be unable to provide the most basic levels of security, rule of law and infrastructure. None of these are perfect, but none of them even come close to where a failed state would need to be. People are not going without food, water or some form of legal protection. Our poor still have a higher standard of life than (most likely) half the planet. \n\nFinally, elections seem to be a safeguard against collapse. Obviously not a perfect one, but it still seems to make collapse less likely. The US essentially has a revolution every two years, we overthrow the old government and elect a new one. Even with a large overlap in membership, it's still a big deal by historical standards. It prevents dynastic decline, it (usually) prevents extremely unpopular people from holding control for very long, and it therefore breaks all the historical norms of empire decline.\n\nThe country goes through pessimistic moods from time to time where we think all is lost and the country is on it's way to decline.

This has been the longest sustained period of \"wrong track\" since they started asking the question, but it doesn't make the worry automatically more real.

Federal Election Commission*.\n\nPeople think this is about campaign donations, it was not. It did not establish corporate personhood, that's over a century old. The general public *never* talk about what's actually in the decision but what they've *heard* is in the decision. It is a case of removing limits on political speech, pure and simple.\n\nSo well everyone here can probably agree on defending the Westboro Baptist Church, this is a trickier question.\n\n___\n\nBackground for those who don't know:\n\nMcCain-Finegold was passed to try to get money out of elections. One of its provisions banned the airing of campaign ads funded by corporations or unions within 60 days of a primary election or 90 days of a general election. An anti-Hillary group Citizens United (originally **C**itizens **U**nited **N**ot **T**imid, I wish I was making that part up) broke that law by distributing an anti-Hillary documentary within weeks of a primary. Most of their money came from individuals, but some came from corporations, meaning they were not supposed to be active that close to an election.\n\nWhat the Supreme Court said was that the free speech that lets you or I say anything political we want at any time we want applies to everyone including corporations and unions. They felt the rule was arbitrary, and that it restricted speech. They reaffirmed that these groups could still not donate to candidates, but said they are free to participate in political discussions like everyone else. If groups didn't have first amendment protections just like people, then it would be potentially legal to restrict their speech in other ways too, including for political organizations and parties.\n\n\n___\n\n\nThe problem is not everyone has the money to buy TV ads in swing states. It may level the playing field on paper, but it ends up possibly crossing the line from freedom to anarchy. It was an expansion of political speech protections that might be the only example I think we can reasonably disagree with.\n\nThat's why *Citizens* can't just be easily repealed, so long as people have absolute rights to political speech why should people lose that right just because they form a group?", "id": "t1_c9tnn30", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "auandi", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1dsli8", "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1431281884, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1367874887, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9tnn30", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1367874693", "ups": 4, "distinguished": null}

In addition to the \"free market\" idea there's also a natural evolutionary process that happens when there's no sanctioned religion. If the nation is changing, there's nothing to keep churches from changing to better fit (and therefore be more relevant to) the general population. And because a church can never have a \"default\" congregation like an official religion, they have to work hard to keep their congregations from leaving.\n\nJust as biological evolution creates a creature more capable of surviving, religious evolution has created churches that are capable of surviving, which never quite happens to the same degree in countries with an official religion. They had to come up with methods of surviving that would give them an advantage. That includes mega-churches, televangelists, Christian radio and TV networks, and that's only the modern innovations.\n\nIt also did another important thing, it allowed churches to stay \"clean\" from the dirt of politics.

In addition to the \"free market\" idea there's also a natural evolutionary process that happens when there's no sanctioned religion. If the nation is changing, there's nothing to keep churches from changing to better fit (and therefore be more relevant to) the general population. And because a church can never have a \"default\" congregation like an official religion, they have to work hard to keep their congregations from leaving.\n\nJust as biological evolution creates a creature more capable of surviving, religious evolution has created churches that are capable of surviving, which never quite happens to the same degree in countries with an official religion. They had to come up with methods of surviving that would give them an advantage. That includes mega-churches, televangelists, Christian radio and TV networks, and that's only the modern innovations.\n\nIt also did another important thing, it allowed churches to stay \"clean\" from the dirt of politics. If a religion is not part of the government, people's anger at the government at various times in history is never translated to the church. It also means churches never *need* to be practical compromisers, they can be ideologically pure and therefore more appealing. \n\nThink of how the Catholic Church is inextricably linked in France to the various governments.

The US has traditionally had a very broad definition of free speech, and without a constitutional amendment saying that political speech can be regulated you'll only make the problem worse.\n\nThis last election for example. Obama's campaign raised $715 million, all from non-corporate donations smaller than $5,000 and Romney raised $446 million using the same rules. Who these people are is public knowledge, as is their field of employment and location. However, none repeat **NONE** of this over $1 billion dollars came directly from corporations or in denominations larger than $5,000. \n\nSo when people talk about corporate cash over the last few years, they aren't talking about campaign contributions they are talking about independent expenditures (sometimes called SuperPACs even thought they have nothing in common with actual PACs). These are non-campaign entities that can collect money in unlimited amounts and use it to engage in political speech, usually in the form of campaign commercials. The Supreme Court said that private citizens and groups are allowed to say whatever they want, that the first amendment protects their ability to engage in political speech. Single individuals were spending tens of millions of dollars advertising their political opinions, but as far as the Supreme Court goes, the dollars don't matter because \"electioneering\" is not considered an exception to free speech. \n\nSo even if you replace campaign funding with public funding, these private groups are still allowed to say things, they are protected by the first amendment. So if candidates are limited in funding, these groups will get even more power than they already have, you would only make the situation worse until there's either a constitutional amendment regarding \"electioneering\" speech or the Supreme Court needs to reverse its decision which it isn't likely to do any time soon.

There are over 45,000 elected positions in the US at local, country, state and federal levels. The reason for political parties in the first place is to (a) make governing coalitions more easily and (b) help pool resources to win elections.

These have been built over the century plus the two American parties have been around and it's almost impossible for a new party to replicate. \n\nSo rather than re-invent all that and *still* risk splitting the vote to make your opponent win, it's much easier to simply win primaries and form a new wing.

In 2004, Bush got more Hispanics than any previous Republican presidential candidate. If he hadn't Kerry might have won. Between a continued lock on the south, and a large split of the growing Hispanic population it did look likely that non-southern Democrats were not going to win the White House for a while.\n\nThen 2005 happened.

But, against Bush and Rove's best efforts, the House Republicans went full retard when debating immigration talking about mass deportations by the millions and electrified fences. From then on the Republicans have been getting fewer and fewer Hispanics as the \"kick'm-out\" wing of the party gets a firmer and firmer hold. \n\nSo it's good to look at trends, and trends look bad for Republicans, but trends can also change unexpectedly.

Part of the reason some of Americas enemy countries do not dare to invade our country is because of all of the un-enlisted military force we have as citizens. America can't be turned into a huge battlefield for a world war because we'd simply wipe out the opposing countries land forces before they could even step foot on to our shores with or without our Military in the vicinity.\n\nGranted yes they could just bomb us as a counter argument etc. etc. and that we'd be dead &amp; have had no chance anyways etc. etc.\n\nI'm saying I would rather we have guns to protect ourselves than a knife or a stick. A gun vs a knife, more often than not the gun would win. Again turning around &amp; using that as an argument to further explain a point about why guns are the problem to gun violence is irrelevant, because at least if it's gun vs gun it's a 50/50 chance. Yes knives &amp; blunt weapons have a less fatal death ratio, but you can't escape the fact that regardless of what weapon a person has at his/her disposal if they wanted to kill somebody, they would fucking do it.\n\nIt isn't even gun violence at this point, it's just violence, plain and simple. Again, a person will murder regardless of what weapon they have access to, the counter argument to this is always going to be \"*But* guns make it easier\". I am not and neither am I trying to avoid or deny that fact. I am saying that people will kill people regardless of what weapon they are using, guns are irrelevant in that argument. You can't solve the problem of fatal violence by targeting guns, saying that if they didn't have a gun they wouldn't have been able to kill that person, which is completely false and so wrong. \n\nIf I wanted to kill somebody, I would do it with whatever the hell I have access to for a weapon. Yes I have access to guns, but I also have access to knives &amp; blunt weapons. If I were to go out &amp; kill somebody with a knife or a blunt weapon of my choosing are you saying that it's not a big deal? You're not going to be outraged over it?\n\nI really have a hard time seeing &amp; understanding how or why people think that way when I could just simply use any damn thing.

By \"one founding father,\" are you talking about Patrick Henry, George Mason, Samuel Adams, John Adams, Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, or someone I did not name?\n\nYes, as in the context of the federalist papers, #46 was the only one in which James Madison expressed concern about government tyranny through taking away arms.\n\n&gt;There is a mechanism within the charter to do this. It's the amendment process. It's hard, and that's on purpose. Because it's very serious business. But you don't just get to brush the Constitution off. And right now, it says \"shall not be infringed.\"\n\nYou are right, but as it stands right now, Republican politicians have their heads so far up their asses, absolutely nothing can get done. It's pointless to even try at the moment, all you do is waste time and gain theater points. I'm not saying we should brush the Constitution aside, but with the kind of deadlock we have right now, people are looking for legal solutions that don't involve a Congress being lobbied by special interests like the NRA and ALEC. No one is saying take all the guns away, I know for sure that will not solve the problem. But we have to give a definition to what \"arms\" include because that is a very broad label.\n\n&gt;So if you want to stop violence, if you want to stop people getting shot, address the actual problem. You bring me a gun control proposal that starts with de-escalating the militarization of police, and I'll at least hear you out. Until then you're just pissing in the wind.\n\nYes, you are right about cops. The expectations of law enforcement needs to be raised. I'm black, I grew up in bad neighborhood on the south side of LA. I know better then most how bad cops can be. Cops need to be better trained and better educated as well as tightening regulations and increasing transparency. But again we are talking about a special interest group, a highly conservative one at that, the same conservatives that vote for the asses in the Congress that give favors to the Police unions. With that being said, Los Angeles is now one of the safest metropolitan areas in the US, and a lot of it is the very large increase in police numbers. In my opinion, law enforcement officers should serve in a more samaritan capacity, shooting your firearm should be a last resort in conflict resolution.\n\nOn a side note, did you know that the only reason the military cannot be used in a law enforcement capacity within the US is because southern politicians wanted the army to not be there to enforce anti-discrimination laws. Pretty interesting huh?\n\nIn addition, I would like to see a federal office that treats firearms like automobiles; \nregistry\ninsurance\na license for each class of gun \na vigorous mandatory training course focusing on how to safely store the weapon away from children and when it is appropriate to use firearms and outlining non-lethal resolution methods.\nStop the block on the CDC's research on gun violence.\nPay more attention to mental health and increase awareness of it.\nRegulate arms manufacturers so no more stock goes up \"missing.\"\n\nMost of the gun related deaths in this country occur because of accidental firing and crimes of passion, you can't say that we can ignore this any longer.\n\nGuns are tools, but they are being used in the wrong way. Instead of a tool for hunting or hobby, in a lot of cases, they are used as tools to dominate and intimidate. This isn't right, no one should have to fear for their life or be afraid while just walking down the street.\n\n&gt;What the fuck. It already happened. You can be disappeared in this country. No trial, no nothin', one day you're there, the next day you're just gone, and it's perfectly legal. The President can order your murder by fiat using flying death robots.

This isn't 1984, it's 2013, and we're gonna be at war with Eurasia for a mighty long time. We are already there. It happened and we did nothing.\n\nI said it was more *Brave New World* then *1984*, books written very long ago that have frightening similarities to the present. Yes, government power needs to be reigned in, the UAMF needs to be revoked and the Patriot Act needs to disappear. Yes, you are right, we collectively let it happen because we bought into hyperbole and dogmatic ideology. We've let corporations and the wealthiest gain significant power over our elected officials. It is terrible and I hate it, but most people do not give a shit. They are too busy working and scraping by to worry about long term power grabs of the rich and powerful.\n\nBut, there is absolutely no chance of large scale war right now, I will explain it if you wish to continue this but I need a break, my fingers are tired.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18xiy7", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8k0t3v", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361576891", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "buffalo_pete", "id": "t1_c8jre3j", "parent_id": "t1_c8jffmq", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431373385, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18xiy7", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8jre3j", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361548535", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "IBStallion", "id": "t1_c8jffmq", "parent_id": "t1_c8j60uf", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431367709, "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's not a matter of belief, I'm aware of the existence and validity of the passage in question. \n\nIt also involves the second amendment interpretation provided dealing with government tyranny.
