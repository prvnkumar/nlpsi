They might *explain* their attitudes in terms of policy because that's more socially acceptable than saying, \"I'm a partisan\" or \"I'm a bigot,\" but in reality it's something other than policy that drives most people's opinions.\n\nI wouldn't say racial attitudes are a major factor for most people -- partisanship is far more powerful -- but it's certainly a factor with substantial empirical support that can hardly be ignored, and these would probably affect opinions toward Obama more than almost any president in history.", "id": "t1_cclmgoy", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Doctor_Worm", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cclm4fq", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429235551, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1380996050, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1npbvz", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cclmgoy", "author_flair_text": "[PhD Student: Political Science][Center-Left]", "created_utc": "1380995298", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cckzu43", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429235709, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1npbvz", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cclm4fq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1380994190", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cckxwuk", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1429246317, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1npbvz", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cckzu43", "author_flair_text": "[PhD Student: Political Science][Center-Left]", "created_utc": "1380904082", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "They could if they wanted to, but there are many reasons why not ... \n\nEmployer-sponsored health insurance really took off around WWII, when labor was scarce and federal wage controls (which were put in place to control wartime inflation) prevented employers from offering higher incomes. But, the War Labor Board ruled that those wage controls did not apply to fringe benefits like health insurance. Vehicle insurance didn't become popular until the 60s and 70s when states started passing laws making it compulsory, and only about 50-60% of the population owned their own homes (compared to 100% of people who need a doctor from time to time). Therefore, as a means for employers to attract more and better workers during the war, health insurance was the best option. \n\nWorkers could have tried to negotiate for HO and auto insurance benefits later on, but they didn't because they had other priorities. Auto insurance and homeowners insurance are far more affordable than health insurance, which means it's a lesser need and a lower priority for workers. Even if they could theoretically get better coverage at a lower rate by taking advantage of an employer's group rate, the difference wouldn't be nearly as noticeable. Whereas most people need to visit the doctor multiple times per year and incur medical costs very regularly, they really only need to rely on auto or homeowners insurance in the event of a rare emergency -- personally, I think I've filed one car insurance claim in my entire life, and I can afford the premiums very easily. Therefore, when workers go to negotiate with employers, they have much bigger priorities than these other types of insurance.\n\nThe reason the *government* wants employers to provide health insurance is because we've decided that hospitals shouldn't throw people out on the streets to die just because they can't afford medical treatment.

I would argue that no individual politician -- including the president -- has a realistic opportunity to make a noticeable difference in any important metric all by him/herself. This is in stark contrast to a public school teacher, who has direct personal control over his/her students' learning at almost all times. The latter is conducive to performance rewards; the former is not. If the rewards are for something that's almost entirely out of your control, it'd be like giving you a raise if you roll a \"6\" on a die. \n\n2) Most of the economic and social metrics you've mentioned are not exact figures the way test scores or sales figures are known precisely. Unemployment, literacy, homelessness, etc. are just estimates, and different researchers will come up with completely different numbers depending on their methodology. Moreover, the typical shifts in these metrics are often smaller than the random sampling error associated with measuring them, such that it would be very difficult for us to ever know if our numbers went up because of actual improvements or because of completely random variation. \n\n3) Different voters have vastly different ideas about which metrics are worth caring about. For instance, a liberal voter might care a lot more about income disparity, while a conservative might care a lot more about total wealth. A liberal voter might care a lot more about environmental metrics like air quality, while a conservative voter might care a lot more about economic metrics like GDP growth. Our electoral system allows voters to incorporate whatever metrics or information they see as important, without us having to assume or dictate which metrics those should be.\n\n4) I don't think the problem is that politicians don't *want* to make things better. Say what you want about the party you disagree with, but everybody thinks their policies would improve the economy, education, etc. The problem is that we disagree about *how* to accomplish those tasks, because there really is no simple answer.\n\n5) Most high-ranking politicians are sufficiently well-connected and/or independently wealthy that they could make a LOT more money in the private sector than they could as members of Congress. They didn't run for office for the money. They ran for office to influence policy.\n\n6) I also echo WebLlama's point about incentivizing short term goals.", "id": "t1_cbuf2nr", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Doctor_Worm", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1kzwyi", "id": "t1_cbuhycu", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "lagr8ange", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cbuf2nr", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429714194, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I want to start off by saying that I also think that most politicians are trying to do what they believe is best for the country. The point of the original article I cited was that Congress (or any group of people, really) seems to have trouble assessing their own performance, unless they are forced to deal with the consequences of their decisions directly. It often seems like Congress as a whole is viewing the nation's problems through a dogmatic lens, resulting in a skewed evaluation of the effects of their actions. What I'm saying is, the gap between *trying* to do a good job and actually *doing* a good job can be sizable, and I'm just trying to figure out a way to narrow that gap.\n\nYour point about the difficulty of gauging individual performance in what is undeniably a group effort is well taken, as is your point about the difficulty of meaningfully analyzing national statistics in nation of 314 million people with any number of conflicting value systems. That being said, I think some objective means of incentivizing performance could be devised. Perhaps if every bill passed had to include a list of intended effects (200,000 new jobs in the next quarter, 30 bridges built by the end of the fiscal year, etc.), and those who voted for or against are rewarded or penalized based on the effectiveness of the bill. Perhaps we could encourage cooperation by paying representatives according to the number of bills they manage to get passed, or the number of members of other parties who vote for their bills.\n\nLike you said, most congresspeople could be making more in the private sector, but they decided that the opportunity cost of taking a congressional seat was worth the chance to influence policy. So maybe you're right, maybe money isn't the answer. Maybe their performance should be tied to their ability to affect change. Maybe they can take a cue from Reddit. \"Hey, your last bill didn't do so well. Maybe you should wait a bit to propose another.\" That last suggestion is probably a bad idea, but you get the point.\n\n\nThe electoral system is intended to allow voters to make the determination on their representative's effectiveness, but if we as voters call for a uniform means of measuring performance, isn't that the effectively the same thing? How can the voter's make a determination on how good their Congressman is at his job, when even the Congressman himself has no way of knowing?At what point do we start taking a hard look at a government that was initially intended for a much smaller, much less complex nation, and start trying to find ways to make it work in today's world?\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cbuhycu", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1377365607", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t3_1kzwyi", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1429715538, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cbuf2nr", "author_flair_text": "[PhD Student: Political Science][Center-Left]", "created_utc": "1377355542", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1jfc9t", "selftext": "You've brought up several different issues here, so I'll do my best to answer:\n\n**How much does the \"spirit of a law\" matter?** \n\nThis is a matter of jurisprudential interpretation. Judges/justices who subscribe to an \"[original intent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_intent)\" interpretation would care most strongly about the framers' intended spirit of the law, but they make up only a subset of all judges. By contrast, \"loose constructionists\" believe the meaning of the Constitution can change over time, while those subscribing to an \"original meaning\" interpretation believe that what the words of the Constitution actually *meant* at the time they were written matter more than what the authors *intended* it to mean. Judges are divided broadly by these interpretations, so the answer to your question will necessarily be different depending on who you ask. In short, it is a matter of opinion with no universally agreed-upon answer. Many politically-interested people will happily give you their own opinion and an argument for why their interpretation is best, but I would advise against treating those as fact.\n\n**It's a far stretch to say the NSA can listen in on our phone calls** \n\nSo far as I'm aware, the cases in question do NOT apply to listening to the content of any phone conversation. They apply to information *about* the conversation (eg. the physical location from which a call was made, or the number dialed, or the time and duration of the call) which the caller willingly makes available to the phone company. You can agree or disagree that such information should be off-limits as well, but it is still a categorically different process (both technically and legally) than tapping a phone and accessing the substantive content of the conversation, so the cases do not affect the Constitutionality of \"listening in.\" \n\n**Gun control?**\n\nThere are many ways judges make their decisions about gun control, but keep in mind that just because a right *exists* does not mean it is *absolute*. The right to free speech does not mean you can say whatever you want, whenever you want -- the courts have long recognized that the government retains the authority to place reasonable restrictions on the \"time, place, and manner\" of your speech, such that you can't shout fire in a crowded theater, can't incite others to overthrow the government, can't distribute child pornography, etc.\n\nLikewise, the fact that the 2nd Amendment exists does not mean that we have the right to carry whatever weapon/accessory we want, wherever we want, under whatever circumstances we want. Most reasonable people probably agree it doesn't protect your right to own a stockpile of WMDs, or for a convicted felon to carry a bazooka into a kindergarten. Most reasonable people also agree that the second amendment DOES protect the right of hunters to own rifles and whatnot. The disagreements are generally over precisely where in between those places to draw the line. That is, which specific weapons/accessories should be off-limits, which specific conditions we should impose on purchasing and ownership (eg. background checks, registration, special rules for felons or the mentally ill, etc.).\n\nOnce we realize that the conversation is not so much about whether or not we should have any gun control whatsoever, but rather about exactly *how much* gun control is appropriate, the conversation can be much more productive.", "id": "t1_cbe55t5", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Doctor_Worm", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1jfc9t", "id": "t1_cbe701u", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Discover2010", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1jfc9t", "selftext": "&gt; Please keep discussion: \n&gt; * Civil\n&gt; * Reputable and sourced\n&gt; * Free of layman speculation", "id": "t1_cbe78up", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Doctor_Worm", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1jfc9t", "id": "t1_cbeayvt", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cbe78up", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429991259, "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cbeayvt", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1375303749", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cbe701u", "score": 5, "retrieved_on": 1429992996, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cbe78up", "author_flair_text": "[PhD Student: Political Science][Center-Left]", "created_utc": "1375294816", "ups": 5, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cbe55t5", "score": -5, "retrieved_on": 1429993110, "controversiality": 0, "body": "When you say you don't want citizens owning WMD's.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1jafs8", "selftext": "&gt; We're talking about you polluting my property in a very obscene, measurable way, to the point that I take you to court for compensation for my injury- and you're arguing it's unfeasible and then citing a scenario where there is so little pollution I couldn't prove it.\n\nThe point is that in the real world, the problem of pollution very rarely takes the form you describe -- where a single source causes most or all of the damage to a given victim, and where that source is straightforwardly obvious. The problem with pollution in the real world is precisely that the individual damage caused by a single polluter (eg. one car or one factory) seems neglible, but the aggregated collective impact of many polluters (eg. lots of cars, or lots of factories) causes very real and dangerous problems. To the extent that you're talking only about pollution \"in a very obscene, measurable way,\" you're essentially admitting that the libertarian solution doesn't have an adequate response to the actual problems most typically associated with pollution, only to some simplistic caricature of the problem that exists only in your head.\n\n&gt; Second, I think an issue is your taking the country exactly as it is now, but throwing it under a libertarian government in the blink of an eye and saying, \"See! You can't fix this!\". So let's assume there's some sort of transitional period, where the car manufacturers and factories know instead of having to pay a fine, they can be sued by every single person they directly affect with their pollution. I'm positive they would make changes, but let's assume they don't. The first question is, what are your losses in this scenario? Health issues? Property value decreased? Let's assume it's something measurable. And let's also assume that since it's so bad that it's measurable, you're not the only one having this issue. It's affecting the entire area. The problem now lies in determining who is the source of all this pollution? The courts will have information on all car's emission, and the same with factories. So instead of tracking down individual offenders, you go after the maker.\n\nThat doesn't address my point at all, which was that it is impractical to parse out *which polluters* caused the losses in question. You can have all the information you want about different cars' emission rates, but in any given lawsuit, how could the plaintiff possibly prove that he developed lung cancer (or whatever) because of the Mercury Sable as opposed to the Toyota Camry, the Dodge Ram, or the brother-in-law who smokes? Realistically, *all* of those pollutants, along with hundreds more, were present and probably each contributed some small effect. The harm also probably took place gradually, over a long period of time, which means lots of the polluters might no longer exist by the time the damage is noticed. How, then, could a plaintiff possibly prove the liability of any specific defendant? And, by extension, if the plaintiff cannot possibly prove definitively who caused the harm in question, what incentive do any of the polluters have to make changes? And remember, these are not artificial parameters I'm imagining or \"straw manning\" -- this is simply the nature of the problem you say you have a better solution to.\n\n&gt; Again, we're using the justice system as it stands today, rather than the one libertarians propose. Yeah, it wouldn't really work now because it's so incredibly expensive. No one would be able to afford a good lawyer, so companies would just go nuts over pollution. What's stopping them? The are two big differences in a libertarian society. 1, the laws are much simpler. To the point that you can and should be able to defend/prosecute for yourself. 2. That even if you can't prosecute or defend yourself, it's a tenet that you're protected against injuries. The government is your lawyer. You have your own Justice Department.

The problem with pollution in the real world is precisely that the individual damage caused by a single polluter (eg. one car or one factory) seems neglible, but the aggregated collective impact of many polluters (eg. lots of cars, or lots of factories) causes very real and dangerous problems. To the extent that you're talking only about pollution \"in a very obscene, measurable way,\" you're essentially admitting that the libertarian solution doesn't have an adequate response to the actual problems most typically associated with pollution, only to some simplistic caricature of the problem that exists only in your head.\n\n&gt; Second, I think an issue is your taking the country exactly as it is now, but throwing it under a libertarian government in the blink of an eye and saying, \"See!

The problem now lies in determining who is the source of all this pollution? The courts will have information on all car's emission, and the same with factories. So instead of tracking down individual offenders, you go after the maker.\n\nThat doesn't address my point at all, which was that it is impractical to parse out *which polluters* caused the losses in question. You can have all the information you want about different cars' emission rates, but in any given lawsuit, how could the plaintiff possibly prove that he developed lung cancer (or whatever) because of the Mercury Sable as opposed to the Toyota Camry, the Dodge Ram, or the brother-in-law who smokes? Realistically, *all* of those pollutants, along with hundreds more, were present and probably each contributed some small effect. The harm also probably took place gradually, over a long period of time, which means lots of the polluters might no longer exist by the time the damage is noticed. How, then, could a plaintiff possibly prove the liability of any specific defendant? And, by extension, if the plaintiff cannot possibly prove definitively who caused the harm in question, what incentive do any of the polluters have to make changes? And remember, these are not artificial parameters I'm imagining or \"straw manning\" -- this is simply the nature of the problem you say you have a better solution to.\n\n&gt; Again, we're using the justice system as it stands today, rather than the one libertarians propose.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1iz3a8", "selftext": "That depends on how you conceive of the left-right spectrum. Some prominent political scientists (eg. Phil Converse) have found that very few people actually think about politics in ideological terms and have only a cursory (or worse) understanding of what \"liberal\" and \"conservative\" actually mean.\n\nColloquially, in the US at least, a lot of people simply equate \"leftist\" with the Democratic party and \"rightist\" with the Republican party, and refer to as \"leftist\" those things that Democrats tend to support, or \"rightist\" those things that Republicans tend to support. If you ask most people, being \"leftist\" means supporting big government on economic issues and small government on social issues, while being \"rightist\" is the opposite. But objectively, there's no logical reason or overarching philosophy that explains *why* big government economics have to go with small government social politics. We call those left and right primarily because that's where our political parties happen to stand right now -- even though the parties' positions on various issues have reversed occasionally throughout history. \n\nIf you think of it that way, where to most people \"left\" simply means \"what Democrats usually like\" and \"right\" simply means \"what Republicans usually like\", then in a two-party system like the US, the norm should for all issues to collapse down to a single-dimension spectrum. This is because parties have an electoral incentive to differentiate themselves from one another, yet enforce party unity to prevent divisions between their own members. Generally speaking, the Democratic Party wants all Democrats to think exactly alike, and to disagree with Republicans on key policy issues. So, if you've got basically two different groups that are differentiating themselves from one another, and members of each group aren't doing much to differentiate themselves from other members of their own group, then one dimension/spectrum/axis is all that is needed to plot the issue positions of those people.\n\nTo the extent that there are some cross-cutting differences that divide members within those groups, there can be other dimensions as well. This can occur when there is a brand new issue that has just come onto the national agenda, or when people are cross-pressured by loyalties that are powerful enough to counterbalance their partisanship. Black civil rights are the classic example of this, and for many decades political opinions were divided not only along classic lines of liberalism and conservatism, but also (for lack of a better term) racial attitudes and states' rights.\n\nToday, as you mentioned, this authoritarian/libertarian divide is probably the most prominent cross-cutting issue we have, but it still doesn't come close to race in the pre-civil rights era. Foreign policy is also usually considered an area of public opinion that doesn't fall neatly into the left/right dichotomy, but at the moment that may be so tightly associated with partisan battles about Iraq and terrorism that it looks like any other issue right now.\n\nMoreover, is it really a left/right dimension and an authoritarian/libertarian dimension? OR, was there always an \"economic issues\" and a \"social issues\" dimension all along, and we're just now seeing an increase in Republicans who favor small government on social issues, thereby making the second dimension detectable where before were couldn't differentiate it from the first dimension?", "id": "t1_cb9jtc6", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Doctor_Worm", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1iz3a8", "id": "t1_cb9r8ny", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "LeMeJustBeingAwesome", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cb9swzp", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cb9r8ny", "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1430344436, "controversiality": 0, "body": "[Link for those unfamiliar with the Nolan Chart he is referring to](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Chart)", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1iz3a8", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cb9swzp", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1374728013", "ups": 4, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "It is a more coherently meaningful chart, but whether it's more *accurate* is a question that changes with time.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "The tricky thing about this question is that presidents are strategic actors, and their decisions don't always necessarily reflect their sincere preferences. \n\nIn other words, presidents don't just decide to send in troops whenever they want to. They look ahead and try to anticipate how the public and Congress and other countries would probably react -- and if they expect that there's even a remote chance that they'd be \"stopped,\" they would choose not to pursue that policy in the first place. \n\nThat makes it difficult to find examples of the people stopping the president, but only because we never actually *observe* the president's action unless he's very confident that the people and Congress will support him. However, this actually *is* a very real constraint on the president's power. The president is deterred from \"making his case\" for war unless he's very very confident that his message will be successful -- and they can usually estimate that very accurately.\n\nThe kind of example you're asking for would require either: (a) a fairly massive miscalculation on president's part as to the reaction of the people, OR (b) an arguably irrational president who had little to no regard for whether his action would be thwarted in embarrassing fashion. Since most people don't get to be president without being at least pretty good at politics, those conditions are very rarely (if ever) met, and therefore we see very few examples of presidential failures of this sort. We see policy failures of other kinds, but since war is such a monumental high-risk option, presidents are likely to be far more cautious in their decision-making than they would be in other policy areas.", "id": "t1_capwaci", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Doctor_Worm", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_1h0r7i", "score": 5, "retrieved_on": 1430689183, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1h0r7i", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_capwaci", "author_flair_text": "[PhD Student: Political Science][Center-Left]", "created_utc": "1372173813", "ups": 5, "distinguished": null}

Nixon committed crimes in the office of the presidency, lied under oath and was caught. It was right to impeach Nixon. But no one is making the motion to impeach Obama and no one has provided evidence that Obama either lied under oath, or even real evidence that the state department could have prevented this action.\n\nLet us not forget that it was congress that took funding from the security measures of the diplomatic missions, and let us also not forget that this was not a full embassy that was attacked, which often do not have the same security levels of an embassy.\n\nAccording to PBS(http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2012/09/securing-embassies.html):\n&gt; The embassy in Tripoli is a fairly new facility. It was constructed in 2009 in accordance with security standards established by the Diplomatic Security Service at the State Department. The building in Benghazi was basically a villa that was being rented to serve as a temporary consulate. So it was built in accordance with your normal residential security standards for Libya. It was not made to withstand rocket or bomb attacks. So it was not a very secure facility at all.\n\nYou throw 150 guys at a civilian residence, with rockets, grenades, and what not, and it is very likely that someone is going to get killed. What should be noted is the testament to our own security forces that only 4 were killed. \n\nThe truly legitimate questions that should be asked are why weren't troops sent in earlier (mind you they were sent in) and what was the break-down in security that led to missed warning, which there were a few. \n\nTo argue this was preventable is to argue with hindsight and ignore the legitimate difficulties in securing our diplomatic objectives across the globe. There are threats that come in every day, and it is a nightmare of a task deciding what is a credible threat and what is not. \n\nThis was a major failing of the Obama administration on security, one that I am fairly certain was met with rage by the administration internally and one that is being dealt with to fix these issues moving forward. \n\nBut lets not also forget that there were 50+ attacks on our embassies and diplomatic missions under Bush, and we never saw such controversy. And we know for certain that he lied to the American people to get us into war. Those lies are documented.  So when you act like some how Obama is getting a slide by the media please remember the following:\n* News Corp. is the largest media producer in the country when talking about news. Its products reach more consumers than any of the other media outlets. It is not only a part of the MSM, it by definition is the main stream. \n* Obama has been slammed since before he was president by their products, and has not had a day in the 4yrs, 100 days that hes been president, where he wasn't \"utterly destroyed\" by News Corp products.\n* Bush and Cheney, while investigated to some extent, have not had to suffer the same vitriol of congress and the MSM for their actions which led to over 200K people being killed, many who had done no wrong to warrant death by America. \n\nThis idea that somehow Obama has gotten off free about Benghazi is a propaganda'ed mess and is nothing but a fallacy.

So, I suppose you could say the poll is measuring their retrospective evaluations of the presidency after all, yet those retrospective evaluations are still influenced disproportionately (though not entirely) by  their current favorability, which is almost always positive for ex-presidents.\n\nAnyways, since you clarified your point it doesn't seem like we actually disagree about this so there's not much purpose in splitting hairs.

Living ex-presidents are almost *always* very popular, because suddenly there's a new guy to blame and the old guy just flies around the country promoting charities and whatnot. The polls  measure the public's *current* favorability toward the person (heavily weighted toward recent events), not their retrospective judgment of their performance in office. Jimmy Carter is more popular today than he ever was, yet his presidency is still widely judged to be mediocre or poor. The same is true of George W. Bush, if you put stock in the rankings of scholars and historians. And although Bush's approval is going *up*, it's still substantially lower than any former president since Nixon. \n\nSecond, it's a little difficult to say objectively who was \"popular\" or not during their time in office, since statistical sampling and public opinion polling didn't really come about until the mid-20th century. We have polls for about ten presidents going back to Truman or so, but that's not much -- and most of them are not far enough in the past to be truly \"judged by history.\" \n\n**But to answer your question:** Perhaps the best example might be Warren Harding.

So, I suppose you could say the poll is measuring their retrospective evaluations of the presidency after all, yet those retrospective evaluations are still influenced disproportionately (though not entirely) by  their current favorability, which is almost always positive for ex-presidents.\n\nAnyways, since you clarified your point it doesn't seem like we actually disagree about this so there's not much purpose in splitting hairs.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1cvgm1", "selftext": "There are two ways I could answer this question --\n\n**First way:** Taxes are voluntary in the sense that opting into the \"social contract\" is voluntary. If you choose to live in a society and take advantage of the protection, benefits, and services it provides, then you have chosen voluntarily to subject yourself to the rules and responsibilities the society imposes on its members. If you choose to violate your end of the \"contract\" by refusing to pay taxes, you cannot expect the other parties to the contract to uphold their end of the contract. You have opted into the \"state of nature\" vis-a-vis the rest of society, where might makes right and life is nasty, brutish, and short. Yes, that alternative sucks -- which is probably why most people choose to abide by the social contract instead. \n\nOf course, you are more than welcome to request changes to the terms of the contract (eg. lobby for a lower tax rate), and you are more than welcome to go somewhere else and enter into a contract with some other society (eg. move to Dhubai or something), and you are more than welcome to refuse to enter any social contract whatsoever (eg. be an anarchist and opt into the state of nature, accepting that anyone who is stronger than you can do whatever they want to you), but you can't change the terms of a given contract unilaterally without the agreement of the other parties. \n\nIn this sense, taxes are not \"robbery\" but rather the terms of the contract we've implicitly agreed to. And taxes are not \"involuntary\" in the sense that we literally have no choice whatsoever, but rather a \"[strictly dominant strategy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_dominance)\" in the sense that paying your taxes and opting *into* the social contract always gives you a better outcome than not paying your taxes and opting *out* of the social contract.\n\n**Second way:** We could agree for the sake of argument that taxes are not \"voluntary\" in some sense. Fine, fair enough. If you don't pay them you get punished, which looks like coercion. But then, the question becomes: is every non-voluntary contribution \"robbery\"? If I run up a bar tab by drinking all night, I either pay the tab or get punished. But did the bartender rob me? If I sit down and let, \n a barber cut my hair, I either pay him or get punished. But did the barber rob me? Absolutely not -- the bartender and the barber were entitled to compensation for the services rendered.\n\nIn the case of taxes, your friend assumes that because his paycheck (or whatever) goes to him, 100% of that money is rightfully his property and anyone who expects some of it is robbing him. However, all of his life, he's been traveling on the government's roads, sleeping safely in his bed because of the government's military and police and fire protection, eating safe food and working in safe buildings because of government regulations, and buying cheap gas because of the government's oil subsidies. Perhaps he's kept his money in an FDIC-insured bank, and perhaps he attended a public school and/or university. At this point, he's spent a lifetime taking advantage of the benefits the government has provided at no small cost. It is virtually impossible to have grown to adulthood and made any money *without* doing so, although he could have chosen at any time to travel to a different country. Therefore, is the government not entitled to some payment for services rendered?\n\nNow, your friend might argue that his tax rate is not tied strictly to the amount of services/benefits he consumed. This is of course true, but not all billing has to work that way, even in the private sector. If you purchase cable TV, you pay for a certain \"package\" instead of picking and choosing just the channels you want -- and you pay for the access, even if you don't watch any TV in a given month. To give another example, my kid's day care charges tuition on a sliding scale, such that the tuition is higher for parents who make more money and lower for parents who make less -- which is just like a progressive tax.\n\nSo, taxes might be \"involuntary\" in the same sense that paying your bar tab is involuntary, but that doesn't make it robbery or immoral. If you consume the benefits, then the person who provided the benefit is entitled to payment for services rendered. Unfortunately, taxes and services are not \"a la carte\" -- but a *lot* of things aren't, and that doesn't make them robbery.

The only thing that can make my rightfully owned property belong to *you* instead of *me* is if I voluntarily consent to some transaction with you. \"Voluntary contracts\" are mutually exclusive with: a transaction based on your assumptions and good-intentions about what I need or could use, and backed by your guns.\n\nI didn't vote for public roads. I didn't vote for public schools. I didn't vote for AMTRAK.

The adjudication process at my university -- a very typical R1 public university -- specifically entitles the complainant and the respondent to call witnesses and submit information on their behalf, and question any witness who appears at the hearing.\n\nIn the WSJ article, the university didn't categorically prohibit the author's son from presenting any evidence -- rather, they *considered* the evidence he provided and simply determined it to be irrelevant to the case before ultimately ruling in the son's favor. \n\nCome to think of it, I personally don't know of *any* colleges where you are prohibited from submitting evidence on your own behalf, but if you've got information to the contrary about \"most universities,\" I'm all ears.\n\n&gt; In the example I used, the accusation is libel/slander/defamation. It is false, it caused the man harm, and it had malice. But in the university setting, you have no defense against it in many cases.\n\nIt's not the university's job to prosecute libel or slander. If that can be proven, you would do it in a court of law.\n\nThe university does have a responsibility to at least look reasonably into the claim instead of taking the accuser's word for it, but there's absolutely no legal necessity that they have to use the exact same standards of scrutiny as a court of law, especially since whatever punishment they could levy (1) is far less serious than what a court could levy, and (2) does not include deprivation of life, liberty, or property. Just as the standards for getting *fired* by the Police Department are entirely different from the standards for getting *detained* by the Police Department.", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Doctor_Worm", "id": "t1_c9hvxea", "parent_id": "t1_c9hsk2i", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431511098, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1366311736, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1clu57", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9hvxea", "author_flair_text": "[PhD Student: Political Science][Center-Left]", "created_utc": "1366311327", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "AuditorTux", "id": "t1_c9hsk2i", "parent_id": "t1_c9hshj0", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431512757, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1366303211, "author_flair_css_class": "green", "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9hsk2i", "author_flair_text": "[CPA][Libertarian]", "created_utc": "1366302969", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Doctor_Worm", "id": "t1_c9hshj0", "parent_id": "t1_c9hsdl6", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1431512790, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1clu57", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9hshj0", "author_flair_text": "[PhD Student: Political Science][Center-Left]", "created_utc": "1366302783", "distinguished": null, "ups": 3}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "AuditorTux", "id": "t1_c9hsdl6", "parent_id": "t1_c9hrz9h", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431512842, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "green", "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1clu57", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9hsdl6", "author_flair_text": "[CPA][Libertarian]", "created_utc": "1366302493", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Doctor_Worm", "id": "t1_c9hrz9h", "parent_id": "t1_c9hrg1b", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431513030, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1clu57", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9hrz9h", "author_flair_text": "[PhD Student: Political Science][Center-Left]", "created_utc": "1366301434", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "AuditorTux", "id": "t1_c9hrg1b", "parent_id": "t1_c9hrbog", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431513281, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "green", "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1clu57", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9hrg1b", "author_flair_text": "[CPA][Libertarian]", "created_utc": "1366299986", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Doctor_Worm", "id": "t1_c9hrbog", "parent_id": "t1_c9hqeob", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431513339, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9hrbog", "author_flair_text": "[PhD Student: Political Science][Center-Left]", "created_utc": "1366299663", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "This is a pretty good question because most people don't realize there's a lot of deliberating/bargaining that goes on behind closed doors. \n\nFirst, the justices will meet together and take a non-binding \"vote\" to signal to one another how they each wish to rule. From this vote, the Chief Justice will choose one person from those voting in the most popular coalition to start writing the \"majority\" opinion. If applicable, other justices may be chosen to write \"dissenting\" opinions. \n\nWriting the first draft of the opinions takes some time, and the clerks working for each justice are typically very heavily involved in the process. Once the drafts are written, they are circulated to the other justices who can choose to \"join\" an opinion if they like it, or can send a memo to the author asking for certain changes in exchange for joining. \n\nIt is not uncommon for justices to change sides -- even multiple times -- as these opinions are circulated and revised. Justices can be persuaded by the points made by an opinion, and can sometimes act strategically by joining an opinion that might not be their first choice of outcomes, in order to create a majority coalition that at least avoids their least-preferred outcome. This also means that opinions that were originally considered the \"majority\" opinion occasionally end up being a \"dissenting\" opinion, and vice versa. (There are some indications that this is precisely what happened with the Obamacare ruling last year.)\n\nAs for why you haven't heard much about it, the answer is that this is not a public process. It takes place in memos circulated privately between the justices' chambers, and nobody outside of their offices will know much for sure until after the opinions and coalitions are finalized. And that can take quite a lot of time and work. \n\n([You can read more about these processes here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedures_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States#Forming_opinions))", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I believe the Chief Justice selects writers only of the side he is on--i.e. he does not decide who writes the dissent if he joins the court's opinion and does not decide the writer of the opinion if he dissents.

I never stated that political scientists are worthless.\n\nYour exact words, in no uncertain terms and with no qualifying statements offered, were, \"We do not need political scientists to give their determinations based on their 'empirical' evidence.\" If by that you meant something other than \"the work political scientists do is not needed,\" then it wasn't clear to me at all and you might want to clarify it.\n\n&gt; I just do not put them on that highest of pedestals that you seemingly do.\n\nI don't understand. What pedestal? My claim was that there are good and bad political scientists just like any other profession, that we have the same accountability processes as other scientific disciplines, and that the scientific method, while imperfect, is probably the best process we've found so far. Which part of that do you dispute?\n\n&gt; I would suggest you read the following exposition. King, Gary. How Not to Lie With Statistics: Avoiding Common Mistakes in Quantitative Political Science. American Journal of Political Science 30: 666\u2013687. I will succinctly paraphrase his point. King esposes a set of crucial analytical errors manifesting with bothersomely consequential recurrency throughout the calculable political science discussion. These inaccuracies are all based on deficient statistical theory or on flawed statistical examination. \n\nAs a methods minor who passed my comprehensive exams, I am already quite familiar with that article and the rest of Gary King's work. And ... it doesn't prove your point in the least. King, if you didn't know, is himself a political scientist and a \"quant\" -- perhaps the most prominent and revered of all quants in the entire discipline, in fact. The AJPS article you cite does *not* condemn political science or empirical research in general. Rather, it explains many common mistakes people make in practice, in order to help political scientists conduct more appropriate tests and draw more valid conclusions from their results. Naturally, lots of political scientists have gotten things wrong in the past, just as physicists have been wrong about the laws of motion and astronomers have been wrong about the geocentric universe. \n\nBut guess what? In the article you cited, Gary King is *providing the exact accountability you asked about earlier*! If one scientist gets something wrong, other scientists can point out what they did wrong, and potentially get their counterarguments published in a top academic journal (AJPS is generally considered #2 behind APSR). Unknowingly, you've provided an example of the scientific process working *exactly as it should*.\n\n&gt; I just do not believe in the finality of determinations made by political scientists. \n\nHuh? Neither do political scientists. All scientific propositions are tentative and are rejected or revised when faced with counter-evidence. What exactly do you think science *is*?\n\n&gt; Ask Mitt Romney if he still believes in their judgements.\n\nI really don't understand what you mean by this. Which political science \"judgments\" steered Romney wrong? As you can see [here](http://www.voteseeing.com/2012/11/2012-presidential-prediction-rankings.html) the top political science prognosticators predicted the 2012 election almost spot on (note that Simon Jackman is a well known political science prof at Stanford, while Nate Silver is an economist and the son of MSU poli sci professor Brian Silver), but most mainstream media prognosticators were dead wrong.\n\n&gt; That was quite Stalinesque on your part to attribute quotes to me that I never said. Maybe you have learned well, or that just reflects the political leanings of your own mentors.\n\nLOL, what? Pot, kettle, black, and all that ... interesting choice to make a hilariously absurd ad hominem attack just one paragraph before complaining about a perceived personal attack.\n\n&gt; Why the personal attack?\n\nI didn't think it was a personal attack. I simply *asked* you which one was the case -- do you have an example (if so, please provide it), or don't you (if so, why are you making blanket statements with nothing to back it up)? Can we surmise from your over the top, knee-jerk defensiveness that you didn't really have such an example in mind?\n\n&gt; Exactly what makes me a bit nervous about political scientists. \n\nSo what, in your mind, makes political scientists different from any other scientists? As I mentioned earlier, pre-conceived biases and \"value judgments\" exist in every single field, including economics, physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, astronomy, and meteorology. In fact, that is the entire reason the scientific method and peer review exist. \n\n&gt; Of which, I am one by the way.\n\nReally? Great! Then you should be well aware that it's *our job* to hold our fellow political scientists accountable -- and not just by doubting everything blindly, but by subjecting their claims to rigorous scrutiny. If you doubt someone else's claim, welcome to the club! That's what publications are made of!

It is imperative that you embrace those flaws, understand its weaknesses if you are to succeed and become a reliable political scientist. We are not useless, however a good political scientist will know his limitations.I will not go for a point by point rebuttal due to the continued redundancy and recalcitrance. However, you mentioned two political scientists that were spot on with the 2012 election results (Not sure Nate himself qualifies though as a political scientist). This course of argument is puerile. How do you account for the two University of Colorado professors (Ken Bickers/Michael Berry) who embarassingly got it way wrong? In other words, you will always be able to find political scientists in almost every election, some who are right and some who are wrong. This is the crux of the problem. Unfortunately, it is what makes Political Science, a dubious science at best. It is one of the reasons, along with ideological biases (I previously mentioned that as a problem in an earlier post) that Congress is debating witholding funding for political science education and research. I would like to refer you to an article that appeared in the New York Times on June 24th, 2012 written by Jacqueline Stevens, a well reknown and respected Professor of Political Science at Northwestern University http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/opinion/sunday/political-scientists-are-lousy-forecasters.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0  She details in no uncertain terms the problems and shortcomings of Political science. Quite honestly it is a damning indictment of the political science profession and the A.P.S.A as well. In one segment Stevens discusses the work of Political Psychologist Philip E. Tetlock in the 1980's. Tetlock began systematically quizzing 284 political experts \u2014 most of whom were political science Ph.D.\u2019s \u2014 on dozens of basic questions, like whether a country would go to war, leave NATO or change its boundaries or a political leader would remain in office. \nTetlock found that Chimps randomly throwing darts at the possible outcomes fared just slightly lower than the experts. I also would suggest you read (in between classes of course) the July 2012 edition of The Economist http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2012/07/political-science  This article offers another scathing rebuke of Political Science. Mostly questioning the legitimacy of it as a true \"science\". I know this will probably infuriate you, given your copious allusions to the \"science\" portion of political science in your prior posts. Do not feel threatened by the numerous esteemed political scientists and scholars who vehemently support my position (I could provide a multitude more). I understand your side, I've heard it for years. But you and your future constituents will be better served, if you accepted the genuineness of the opposing argument and not get lost in the self absorbed scholarly world you are living in. Reality will bite you if you fail to recognize it. Political Scientists are valuable tools, but they are not the final nor absolute word. And all would be better off if we called ourselves Political Academicians. The science argument is lost.Yeah, I like that.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bumu1", "selftext": "&gt; You seem to hold political scientists in high regard. You assume they have exemplary standards of evidence and reason. But who ensures the rationality of political scientists, making sure that they will be held accountable for the integrity of their advice and conclusions?\n\nLike any other science, some people have exemplary standards and others have less than exemplary standards. I don't doubt that there are some lousy scientists out there, in the same way that there are some lousy mechanics, doctors, and librarians. I don't for one second take that to mean that mechanics, doctors, and librarians *in general* are all worthless.\n\nAnd like any other science, accountability is provided via peer review and repeatability. If you doubt the claims of any political science research, you or anyone else is welcome to provide counter-evidence. Do you have an example of a claim you doubt? \n\n&gt; Political Science is the dispensing of preceptive methods which are loaded with value judgments.These value judgments include which facts and disciplines are relevant; when is new knowledge reliable enough for use; which dissenting viewpoints deserve to be heard; and when is action appropriate. Consequently, political science conclusions can never be entirely apart from politics.\n\nFirst, questions like \"when is new knowledge reliable enough for use\" and \"when is action appropriate\" are not, generally speaking, questions of political science. Those are normative judgments, not empirical questions. This is the difference between the scientist studying heart disease and the doctor who must ultimately prescribe treatments. Political scientists provide the raw knowledge and information that permits decision-makers to make better-informed decisions.\n\nSecond, if you're saying scientists' opinions and values are a potential challenge to objective research, I agree to an extent. But if you read Kuhn or Lakatos, the same is true of science in general. If you're categorically throwing out all research related to things people have opinions and \"value judgments\" about, I'm afraid you're not left with much knowledge at all. No scientist -- even biologists and physicists -- can ever be truly unbiased about their work, but the scientific method and peer review at least provide us with a *process* that has proven to be more objective than any other process anyone has thought of so far. \n\n&gt; In free societies, no group of should be beyond critical analysis. If judges, senators and presidents may not presume to stand above the law, still less should political scientists seek to muffle themselves from scrutiny of their adjudication. \n\n???\n\nNo scientist of any kind -- including political science -- claims to be \"beyond critical analysis.\" In fact, the entire scientific enterprise is built around making falsifiable predictions, subjecting them to the most rigorous scrutiny possible, and opening it up for those who disagree to do the same. \n\n&gt; We do not need political scientists to give their determinations based on their \"empirical\" evidence.\n\nI have no idea how that conclusion follows logically from what preceded it -- it's a big leap from \"political science is not exempt from scrutiny\" to \"political science is useless.\"\n\nNor do I understand why you think the word empirical belongs in quotes, implying that you doubt whether political science research is rigorous or empirical enough. Do you have an example of research that is widely accepted within political science that does not stand up to your scrutiny? If so, can you explain why it is inferior? Or are you merely making blanket statements dismissing an entire scientific discipline with which you have less than even a passing familiarity?", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Disingenuous. I never stated that political scientists are worthless.\n\nYour exact words, in no uncertain terms and with no qualifying statements offered, were, \"We do not need political scientists to give their determinations based on their 'empirical' evidence.\" If by that you meant something other than \"the work political scientists do is not needed,\" then it wasn't clear to me at all and you might want to clarify it.\n\n&gt; I just do not put them on that highest of pedestals that you seemingly do.\n\nI don't understand. What pedestal? My claim was that there are good and bad political scientists just like any other profession, that we have the same accountability processes as other scientific disciplines, and that the scientific method, while imperfect, is probably the best process we've found so far. Which part of that do you dispute?\n\n&gt; I would suggest you read the following exposition. King, Gary. How Not to Lie With Statistics: Avoiding Common Mistakes in Quantitative Political Science. American Journal of Political Science 30: 666\u2013687. I will succinctly paraphrase his point. King esposes a set of crucial analytical errors manifesting with bothersomely consequential recurrency throughout the calculable political science discussion. These inaccuracies are all based on deficient statistical theory or on flawed statistical examination. \n\nAs a methods minor who passed my comprehensive exams, I am already quite familiar with that article and the rest of Gary King's work. And ... it doesn't prove your point in the least. King, if you didn't know, is himself a political scientist and a \"quant\" -- perhaps the most prominent and revered of all quants in the entire discipline, in fact. The AJPS article you cite does *not* condemn political science or empirical research in general. Rather, it explains many common mistakes people make in practice, in order to help political scientists conduct more appropriate tests and draw more valid conclusions from their results. Naturally, lots of political scientists have gotten things wrong in the past, just as physicists have been wrong about the laws of motion and astronomers have been wrong about the geocentric universe. \n\nBut guess what? In the article you cited, Gary King is *providing the exact accountability you asked about earlier*! If one scientist gets something wrong, other scientists can point out what they did wrong, and potentially get their counterarguments published in a top academic journal (AJPS is generally considered #2 behind APSR).

However, you mentioned two political scientists that were spot on with the 2012 election results (Not sure Nate himself qualifies though as a political scientist). This course of argument is puerile.

In other words, you will always be able to find political scientists in almost every election, some who are right and some who are wrong. This is the crux of the problem. Unfortunately, it is what makes Political Science, a dubious science at best. It is one of the reasons, along with ideological biases (I previously mentioned that as a problem in an earlier post) that Congress is debating witholding funding for political science education and research. I would like to refer you to an article that appeared in the New York Times on June 24th, 2012 written by Jacqueline Stevens, a well reknown and respected Professor of Political Science at Northwestern University http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/opinion/sunday/political-scientists-are-lousy-forecasters.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0  She details in no uncertain terms the problems and shortcomings of Political science. Quite honestly it is a damning indictment of the political science profession and the A.P.S.A as well. In one segment Stevens discusses the work of Political Psychologist Philip E. Tetlock in the 1980's. Tetlock began systematically quizzing 284 political experts \u2014 most of whom were political science Ph.D.\u2019s \u2014 on dozens of basic questions, like whether a country would go to war, leave NATO or change its boundaries or a political leader would remain in office. \nTetlock found that Chimps randomly throwing darts at the possible outcomes fared just slightly lower than the experts. I also would suggest you read (in between classes of course) the July 2012 edition of The Economist http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2012/07/political-science  This article offers another scathing rebuke of Political Science. Mostly questioning the legitimacy of it as a true \"science\". I know this will probably infuriate you, given your copious allusions to the \"science\" portion of political science in your prior posts. Do not feel threatened by the numerous esteemed political scientists and scholars who vehemently support my position (I could provide a multitude more). I understand your side, I've heard it for years. But you and your future constituents will be better served, if you accepted the genuineness of the opposing argument and not get lost in the self absorbed scholarly world you are living in. Reality will bite you if you fail to recognize it. Political Scientists are valuable tools, but they are not the final nor absolute word. And all would be better off if we called ourselves Political Academicians. The science argument is lost.Yeah, I like that.

If you doubt the claims of any political science research, you or anyone else is welcome to provide counter-evidence. Do you have an example of a claim you doubt? \n\n&gt; Political Science is the dispensing of preceptive methods which are loaded with value judgments.These value judgments include which facts and disciplines are relevant; when is new knowledge reliable enough for use; which dissenting viewpoints deserve to be heard; and when is action appropriate. Consequently, political science conclusions can never be entirely apart from politics.\n\nFirst, questions like \"when is new knowledge reliable enough for use\" and \"when is action appropriate\" are not, generally speaking, questions of political science. Those are normative judgments, not empirical questions. This is the difference between the scientist studying heart disease and the doctor who must ultimately prescribe treatments. Political scientists provide the raw knowledge and information that permits decision-makers to make better-informed decisions.\n\nSecond, if you're saying scientists' opinions and values are a potential challenge to objective research, I agree to an extent. But if you read Kuhn or Lakatos, the same is true of science in general. If you're categorically throwing out all research related to things people have opinions and \"value judgments\" about, I'm afraid you're not left with much knowledge at all. No scientist -- even biologists and physicists -- can ever be truly unbiased about their work, but the scientific method and peer review at least provide us with a *process* that has proven to be more objective than any other process anyone has thought of so far. \n\n&gt; In free societies, no group of should be beyond critical analysis. If judges, senators and presidents may not presume to stand above the law, still less should political scientists seek to muffle themselves from scrutiny of their adjudication. \n\n???\n\nNo scientist of any kind -- including political science -- claims to be \"beyond critical analysis.\" In fact, the entire scientific enterprise is built around making falsifiable predictions, subjecting them to the most rigorous scrutiny possible, and opening it up for those who disagree to do the same. \n\n&gt; We do not need political scientists to give their determinations based on their \"empirical\" evidence.\n\nI have no idea how that conclusion follows logically from what preceded it -- it's a big leap from \"political science is not exempt from scrutiny\" to \"political science is useless.\"\n\nNor do I understand why you think the word empirical belongs in quotes, implying that you doubt whether political science research is rigorous or empirical enough.

What pedestal? My claim was that there are good and bad political scientists just like any other profession, that we have the same accountability processes as other scientific disciplines, and that the scientific method, while imperfect, is probably the best process we've found so far. Which part of that do you dispute?\n\n&gt; I would suggest you read the following exposition. King, Gary. How Not to Lie With Statistics: Avoiding Common Mistakes in Quantitative Political Science. American Journal of Political Science 30: 666\u2013687. I will succinctly paraphrase his point. King esposes a set of crucial analytical errors manifesting with bothersomely consequential recurrency throughout the calculable political science discussion. These inaccuracies are all based on deficient statistical theory or on flawed statistical examination. \n\nAs a methods minor who passed my comprehensive exams, I am already quite familiar with that article and the rest of Gary King's work. And ... it doesn't prove your point in the least. King, if you didn't know, is himself a political scientist and a \"quant\" -- perhaps the most prominent and revered of all quants in the entire discipline, in fact. The AJPS article you cite does *not* condemn political science or empirical research in general. Rather, it explains many common mistakes people make in practice, in order to help political scientists conduct more appropriate tests and draw more valid conclusions from their results. Naturally, lots of political scientists have gotten things wrong in the past, just as physicists have been wrong about the laws of motion and astronomers have been wrong about the geocentric universe. \n\nBut guess what? In the article you cited, Gary King is *providing the exact accountability you asked about earlier*! If one scientist gets something wrong, other scientists can point out what they did wrong, and potentially get their counterarguments published in a top academic journal (AJPS is generally considered #2 behind APSR). Unknowingly, you've provided an example of the scientific process working *exactly as it should*.\n\n&gt; I just do not believe in the finality of determinations made by political scientists. \n\nHuh? Neither do political scientists. All scientific propositions are tentative and are rejected or revised when faced with counter-evidence. What exactly do you think science *is*?\n\n&gt; Ask Mitt Romney if he still believes in their judgements.\n\nI really don't understand what you mean by this. Which political science \"judgments\" steered Romney wrong? As you can see [here](http://www.voteseeing.com/2012/11/2012-presidential-prediction-rankings.html) the top political science prognosticators predicted the 2012 election almost spot on (note that Simon Jackman is a well known political science prof at Stanford, while Nate Silver is an economist and the son of MSU poli sci professor Brian Silver), but most mainstream media prognosticators were dead wrong.\n\n&gt; That was quite Stalinesque on your part to attribute quotes to me that I never said. Maybe you have learned well, or that just reflects the political leanings of your own mentors.\n\nLOL, what? Pot, kettle, black, and all that ... interesting choice to make a hilariously absurd ad hominem attack just one paragraph before complaining about a perceived personal attack.\n\n&gt; Why the personal attack?\n\nI didn't think it was a personal attack. I simply *asked* you which one was the case -- do you have an example (if so, please provide it), or don't you (if so, why are you making blanket statements with nothing to back it up)? Can we surmise from your over the top, knee-jerk defensiveness that you didn't really have such an example in mind?\n\n&gt; Exactly what makes me a bit nervous about political scientists. \n\nSo what, in your mind, makes political scientists different from any other scientists? As I mentioned earlier, pre-conceived biases and \"value judgments\" exist in every single field, including economics, physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, astronomy, and meteorology. In fact, that is the entire reason the scientific method and peer review exist. \n\n&gt; Of which, I am one by the way.\n\nReally? Great! Then you should be well aware that it's *our job* to hold our fellow political scientists accountable -- and not just by doubting everything blindly, but by subjecting their claims to rigorous scrutiny. If you doubt someone else's claim, welcome to the club! That's what publications are made of! But instead of just calling them names and feeling \"nervous\" (neither of which adds anything of value to our collective body of knowledge), come up with a way to test the claim and report your results.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; you mentioned two political scientists that were spot on with the 2012 election results\n\nNo, I did not.

In what sense is \"politics\" itself a failed system? Are you confusing \"politics\" in general with one specific kind of political structure?

But generally speaking, political scientists study the ways by which societies as a whole make some of the most important decisions they will ever make (eg. whether to go to war, how to allocate scarce resources, what rules and norms to enforce, what services and public goods to provide, etc.) These are absolutely not just historical questions because societies are still making these decisions right now, and will continue to make these decisions throughout the foreseeable future.\n\nMost political scientists would probably believe that by understanding these decisions, how/why they are made, and what factors lead to what outcomes, we can equip people to make \"better\" decisions when it comes to these most fundamental and far-reaching decisions. \n\nSome do this by studying institutions (ie. how do formal arrangements like parties, NGOs, committees, or filibusters affect outcomes?). Some do this by studying behavior (ie. what factors influence the way people participate in, think about, and ultimately make the aforementioned decisions?).

Consequently, political science conclusions can never be entirely apart from politics.\n\nFirst, questions like \"when is new knowledge reliable enough for use\" and \"when is action appropriate\" are not, generally speaking, questions of political science. Those are normative judgments, not empirical questions. This is the difference between the scientist studying heart disease and the doctor who must ultimately prescribe treatments. Political scientists provide the raw knowledge and information that permits decision-makers to make better-informed decisions.\n\nSecond, if you're saying scientists' opinions and values are a potential challenge to objective research, I agree to an extent. But if you read Kuhn or Lakatos, the same is true of science in general. If you're categorically throwing out all research related to things people have opinions and \"value judgments\" about, I'm afraid you're not left with much knowledge at all. No scientist -- even biologists and physicists -- can ever be truly unbiased about their work, but the scientific method and peer review at least provide us with a *process* that has proven to be more objective than any other process anyone has thought of so far. \n\n&gt; In free societies, no group of should be beyond critical analysis. If judges, senators and presidents may not presume to stand above the law, still less should political scientists seek to muffle themselves from scrutiny of their adjudication. \n\n???\n\nNo scientist of any kind -- including political science -- claims to be \"beyond critical analysis.\" In fact, the entire scientific enterprise is built around making falsifiable predictions, subjecting them to the most rigorous scrutiny possible, and opening it up for those who disagree to do the same. \n\n&gt; We do not need political scientists to give their determinations based on their \"empirical\" evidence.\n\nI have no idea how that conclusion follows logically from what preceded it -- it's a big leap from \"political science is not exempt from scrutiny\" to \"political science is useless.\"\n\nNor do I understand why you think the word empirical belongs in quotes, implying that you doubt whether political science research is rigorous or empirical enough. Do you have an example of research that is widely accepted within political science that does not stand up to your scrutiny? If so, can you explain why it is inferior?

What pedestal? My claim was that there are good and bad political scientists just like any other profession, that we have the same accountability processes as other scientific disciplines, and that the scientific method, while imperfect, is probably the best process we've found so far. Which part of that do you dispute?\n\n&gt; I would suggest you read the following exposition. King, Gary. How Not to Lie With Statistics: Avoiding Common Mistakes in Quantitative Political Science. American Journal of Political Science 30: 666\u2013687. I will succinctly paraphrase his point. King esposes a set of crucial analytical errors manifesting with bothersomely consequential recurrency throughout the calculable political science discussion. These inaccuracies are all based on deficient statistical theory or on flawed statistical examination. \n\nAs a methods minor who passed my comprehensive exams, I am already quite familiar with that article and the rest of Gary King's work. And ... it doesn't prove your point in the least. King, if you didn't know, is himself a political scientist and a \"quant\" -- perhaps the most prominent and revered of all quants in the entire discipline, in fact. The AJPS article you cite does *not* condemn political science or empirical research in general. Rather, it explains many common mistakes people make in practice, in order to help political scientists conduct more appropriate tests and draw more valid conclusions from their results. Naturally, lots of political scientists have gotten things wrong in the past, just as physicists have been wrong about the laws of motion and astronomers have been wrong about the geocentric universe. \n\nBut guess what? In the article you cited, Gary King is *providing the exact accountability you asked about earlier*! If one scientist gets something wrong, other scientists can point out what they did wrong, and potentially get their counterarguments published in a top academic journal (AJPS is generally considered #2 behind APSR). Unknowingly, you've provided an example of the scientific process working *exactly as it should*.\n\n&gt; I just do not believe in the finality of determinations made by political scientists. \n\nHuh? Neither do political scientists. All scientific propositions are tentative and are rejected or revised when faced with counter-evidence. What exactly do you think science *is*?\n\n&gt; Ask Mitt Romney if he still believes in their judgements.\n\nI really don't understand what you mean by this. Which political science \"judgments\" steered Romney wrong? As you can see [here](http://www.voteseeing.com/2012/11/2012-presidential-prediction-rankings.html) the top political science prognosticators predicted the 2012 election almost spot on (note that Simon Jackman is a well known political science prof at Stanford, while Nate Silver is an economist and the son of MSU poli sci professor Brian Silver), but most mainstream media prognosticators were dead wrong.\n\n&gt; That was quite Stalinesque on your part to attribute quotes to me that I never said. Maybe you have learned well, or that just reflects the political leanings of your own mentors.\n\nLOL, what? Pot, kettle, black, and all that ... interesting choice to make a hilariously absurd ad hominem attack just one paragraph before complaining about a perceived personal attack.\n\n&gt; Why the personal attack?\n\nI didn't think it was a personal attack. I simply *asked* you which one was the case -- do you have an example (if so, please provide it), or don't you (if so, why are you making blanket statements with nothing to back it up)? Can we surmise from your over the top, knee-jerk defensiveness that you didn't really have such an example in mind?\n\n&gt; Exactly what makes me a bit nervous about political scientists. \n\nSo what, in your mind, makes political scientists different from any other scientists? As I mentioned earlier, pre-conceived biases and \"value judgments\" exist in every single field, including economics, physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, astronomy, and meteorology. In fact, that is the entire reason the scientific method and peer review exist. \n\n&gt; Of which, I am one by the way.\n\nReally? Great! Then you should be well aware that it's *our job* to hold our fellow political scientists accountable -- and not just by doubting everything blindly, but by subjecting their claims to rigorous scrutiny. If you doubt someone else's claim, welcome to the club! That's what publications are made of! But instead of just calling them names and feeling \"nervous\" (neither of which adds anything of value to our collective body of knowledge), come up with a way to test the claim and report your results.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; you mentioned two political scientists that were spot on with the 2012 election results\n\nNo, I did not.

Quite honestly it is a damning indictment of the political science profession and the A.P.S.A as well. In one segment Stevens discusses the work of Political Psychologist Philip E. Tetlock in the 1980's. Tetlock began systematically quizzing 284 political experts \u2014 most of whom were political science Ph.D.\u2019s \u2014 on dozens of basic questions, like whether a country would go to war, leave NATO or change its boundaries or a political leader would remain in office. \nTetlock found that Chimps randomly throwing darts at the possible outcomes fared just slightly lower than the experts.

A loose constructionist might point to [Federalist Paper no. 44](http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa44.htm), in which James Madison writes:\n\n&gt; Had the convention attempted a positive enumeration of the powers necessary and proper for carrying their other powers into effect, the attempt would have involved a complete digest of laws on every subject to which the Constitution relates; accommodated too, not only to the existing state of things, but to all the possible changes which futurity may produce; for in every new application of a general power, the particular powers, which are the means of attaining the object of the general power, must always necessarily vary with that object, and be often properly varied whilst the object remains the same.\n\nErgo, according to Madison, *if* the framers had set out to explicitly write out a complete, detailed definition of what they thought might be \"necessary\" and \"proper,\" they would have accommodated it \"not only to the existing state of things, but to *all the possible changes which futurity may produce.*\" But, Madison says, they didn't because they couldn't.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "It gets at the [free rider problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_rider_problem).\n\nThe argument goes something like this ...\n\n1) Unions provide benefits that all employees get, regardless of whether they chose to pay dues. Things like negotiating for a safe work environment and a good company health care plan are often [non-excludable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excludability) goods from the union's point of view, since these become company-wide policies that don't differentiate between union members and non-members. Moreover, unions are **required by law**, ie. by government intervention, to fully represent non-members no differently from members. If this is the case, it only seems fair that people should help pay for what they get, but the free-rider problem means more than that ...\n\n2) When a good is non-excludable even though it is completely optional to pay the costs, individuals have no personal incentive to pay anything. At the individual level, the choice is: (A) pay dues and reap benefits, or (B) pay nothing and reap benefits. Why pay union dues if you won't be denied the rewards whether you pay or not?\n\n3) As large numbers of individuals do what is personally rational (ie. try to free ride), the collective action problem arises -- there are not enough resources contributed (ie. dues paid) to provide the benefit, so eventually the benefit is under-produced, over-used, and may even disappear entirely. \n\n4) You might think part (3) would lead people to start contributing voluntarily, but the structure of each individual's choice hasn't changed -- the essence of the collective action problem is that no individual can afford to provide the benefit entirely on their own. That is, each member's dues makes up such a tiny percentage of the overall cost that whether an individual pays dues makes no noticeable difference in whether the benefit is provided. The individual's choice is, at this point: (A) pay dues and get nothing, or (B) pay nothing and get nothing. It is only in the aggregate -- when large numbers of employees who are each acting rationally in their own self interest start to add up -- that the problem exists. This is the essence of this kind of collective action problem. *Individuals* are acting in their own self interest, yet everyone ends up mutually worse off because of the *cumulative effect* of their actions.\n\n5) There are usually two different ways to solve the free rider problem. The first is to link individuals' payoff with their contribution -- that is, to say \"you only get what you pay for.\" However, as stated above, this is already prohibited by law because unions are required to represent non-members the same as members. And even if it wasn't, many benefits are non-excludable by their very nature. So, the second way is to use some sort of enforcement mechanism to make contribution mandatory. This is what government does when it makes you pay taxes, and it's what unions do when they make you pay dues. However, Right to Work laws take that option off the table for unions, ensuring that the costs of union representation will always be optional even while the benefits are legally required to be universal.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Lets assume we are starting at the beginning of the unionizing drive...\n\nIf I vote no, but the vote succeeds, why should I be forced into an arrangement (essentially a contract) that I have not agreed to?

The other half (the side I'm on), believes its just the government meddling with the marketplace, and actually reduces freedom. \nI have plenty Libertarian friends who are anti-union because of the negative aspects of the reality of some unions.

You take it as a given that the \"right\" to do X is exactly the same as the \"right\" to do Y, but most people don't think that way and there's no objective reason one can't agree with one \"right\" and disagree with another, on the *merits* of each. \n\n&gt; You're correct that she is arguing guns on their merits, and I think she is doing a good job at it. I'm just here to support her arguments with the constitutional arguments.\n\nNobody disputes that Heller, etc. is the the current judicial precedent, so I'm not sure what support you're hoping to provide.\n\n&gt; I haven't seen any arguments from you that those standards are bad and should be struck down with a constitutional amendment. All you said was that you are personally ambivalent to gun control, and that if people legitimately need a \" military-grade assault rifle\", that we have much bigger problems we need to discuss in our society, which I agreed with.\n\nThat was my argument because that's my position. I *am* personally ambivalent to gun control, and I don't claim to have a firm preference in terms of what those standards should be. I *am* generally favorable toward the right to gun ownership, but I acknowledge that hypothetically, *some* additional restrictions could be beneficial (no, I'm not entirely sure what, but I'm open-minded to ideas and counter-arguments against those ideas). What I disagree firmly with are blanket statements that any and all additional regulations on gun ownership would be bad.\n\n&gt; Incidentally, \"military-grade assault rifles\" have been banned for civilian manufacture and sale since 1986, and they aren't what is being discussed in this round of gun control, we are discussing \"military style assault weapons\", which are not military grade, and are not assault rifles.\n\nYes, I know and agree. I was making a distinction between guns you *can* have and guns you *can't* have, because the OP was worried about the lives that would be lost due to lack of access to guns. My point was, if there's some realistic situation in which having only a handgun (an allowed weapon) instead of a military-grade assault weapon (a banned weapon) is going to cost us lives, why aren't we talking about whatever the heck that is? Is it the government sending the Marines to kill someone in their home? Is it a zombie invasion? Whatever it is that's costing lives and too powerful for mere handguns, I'd like to be forewarned.\n\n&gt;  You are willing to tolerate the prohibition of a class of weapon which is functionally the same as weapons which you don't want to prohibit, while I want to allow unrestricted access to weapons that are functionally much more deadly and dangerous than the ones which are currently unrestricted.\n\nI don't believe I ever expressed a personal opinion on the ban. My argument was only that, in principle, *some weapons* are dangerous enough to ban, and that *proponents of the AWB* believe that includes this type of weapon. I was quibbling with the OP's sweeping blanket statements.\n\n&gt; Except that's exceedingly difficult, the lower courts will decide based on DC V Heller, and it will never make it to the supreme court to be overturned. They would refuse the case, letting the lower court rulings stand. It's not easy to directly contradict a prior ruling, they must take prior rulings into consideration in all new decisions. Also exceedingly difficult. Good luck getting 3/4 of the states to ratify.\n\nOf course it's difficult. So what? We can't even discuss what's good and bad because it's *hard* to make changes? What kind of defeatist attitude is that?\n\n&gt; Most people don't know the definition of an assault weapon.\n\nI agree. But you're the one counting on those ignorant people to defeat lots of incumbents on the basis of this one issue they apparently don't know much about.\n\n&gt; Anyway, it takes a lot more than 57% to get something done. Around 70% favored the public option for healthcare, and around 70% favored ending the bush tax cuts for the rich, but we didn't get either of those things.\n\nThat's just silly. If it took more than 70% public approval to get anything done, then nothing would ever get done. The public isn't that unified about virtually *anything* non-trivial.

But don't pretend the only option is to ignore it.\n\n&gt; You don't have to agree, but that doesn't mean you can change it or do anything about it.\n\nDon't be silly -- of course someone can do something about it. If you think you have a valid argument, you can raise or support a new legal challenge in the courts that might lead to the precedent being overturned. You can try to amend the constitution. Or you can craft a more narrowly tailored policy that accomplishes similar goals while fitting inside the boundaries the Supreme Court has laid out.\n\n&gt; Such an amendment would fail on it's merits, and the legislators who proposed and supported it would face difficult re-election campaigns.\n\nReally? What makes you so sure? [Polls](http://www.pollingreport.com/guns.htm) have shown that somewhere around 44-57% of Americans would favor an assault weapons ban, and a plurality say they'd be *more* likely to vote for a member of Congress who voted for it.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1b46fm", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; You're right that she is probably female, but she never specifically says that.\n\nLOL, the words \"my womb\" don't tip you off?\n\n&gt;  I don't give pro-life people any slack either, they are just as bad as gun control advocates, they both want to restrict our rights.\n\nFair enough, though that sort of false equivalence strikes me as naive. You take it as a given that the \"right\" to do X is exactly the same as the \"right\" to do Y, but most people don't think that way and there's no objective reason one can't agree with one \"right\" and disagree with another, on the *merits* of each. \n\n&gt; You're correct that she is arguing guns on their merits, and I think she is doing a good job at it. I'm just here to support her arguments with the constitutional arguments.\n\nNobody disputes that Heller, etc. is the the current judicial precedent, so I'm not sure what support you're hoping to provide.\n\n&gt; I haven't seen any arguments from you that those standards are bad and should be struck down with a constitutional amendment. All you said was that you are personally ambivalent to gun control, and that if people legitimately need a \" military-grade assault rifle\", that we have much bigger problems we need to discuss in our society, which I agreed with.\n\nThat was my argument because that's my position. I *am* personally ambivalent to gun control, and I don't claim to have a firm preference in terms of what those standards should be. I *am* generally favorable toward the right to gun ownership, but I acknowledge that hypothetically, *some* additional restrictions could be beneficial (no, I'm not entirely sure what, but I'm open-minded to ideas and counter-arguments against those ideas). What I disagree firmly with are blanket statements that any and all additional regulations on gun ownership would be bad.\n\n&gt; Incidentally, \"military-grade assault rifles\" have been banned for civilian manufacture and sale since 1986, and they aren't what is being discussed in this round of gun control, we are discussing \"military style assault weapons\", which are not military grade, and are not assault rifles.\n\nYes, I know and agree. I was making a distinction between guns you *can* have and guns you *can't* have, because the OP was worried about the lives that would be lost due to lack of access to guns. My point was, if there's some realistic situation in which having only a handgun (an allowed weapon) instead of a military-grade assault weapon (a banned weapon) is going to cost us lives, why aren't we talking about whatever the heck that is? Is it the government sending the Marines to kill someone in their home? Is it a zombie invasion? Whatever it is that's costing lives and too powerful for mere handguns, I'd like to be forewarned.\n\n&gt;  You are willing to tolerate the prohibition of a class of weapon which is functionally the same as weapons which you don't want to prohibit, while I want to allow unrestricted access to weapons that are functionally much more deadly and dangerous than the ones which are currently unrestricted.\n\nI don't believe I ever expressed a personal opinion on the ban. My argument was only that, in principle, *some weapons* are dangerous enough to ban, and that *proponents of the AWB* believe that includes this type of weapon. I was quibbling with the OP's sweeping blanket statements.\n\n&gt; Except that's exceedingly difficult, the lower courts will decide based on DC V Heller, and it will never make it to the supreme court to be overturned. They would refuse the case, letting the lower court rulings stand. It's not easy to directly contradict a prior ruling, they must take prior rulings into consideration in all new decisions. Also exceedingly difficult. Good luck getting 3/4 of the states to ratify.\n\nOf course it's difficult. So what? We can't even discuss what's good and bad because it's *hard* to make changes? What kind of defeatist attitude is that?\n\n&gt; Most people don't know the definition of an assault weapon.\n\nI agree. But you're the one counting on those ignorant people to defeat lots of incumbents on the basis of this one issue they apparently don't know much about.\n\n&gt; Anyway, it takes a lot more than 57% to get something done. Around 70% favored the public option for healthcare, and around 70% favored ending the bush tax cuts for the rich, but we didn't get either of those things.\n\nThat's just silly. If it took more than 70% public approval to get anything done, then nothing would ever get done. The public isn't that unified about virtually *anything* non-trivial.

You're right that *she* is probably female, but she never specifically says that.  She also never said she is against abortion being legal, despite implying that she thinks it's odd that she has that right.\n\n&gt;If the only issue is hypocrisy, then aren't you forced to conclude that gun rights advocates who are also pro-life are hypocrites by the same logic\n\nWell, I think people who are pro-life are advocating for an appalling restriction of rights, and yes, if they are pro-gun I see that as hypocrisy.  I don't give pro-life people any slack either, they are just as bad as gun control advocates, they both want to restrict our rights.\n\nAgain, OP never specifically said she was pro-life, and even if she is, it's not relevant to her argument.  The hypocrisy she sees is still valid, even if she is guilty of similar hypocrisy.\n\n&gt;she's even argued she should be able to have a grenade launcher (which you yourself say is not protected by the 2nd amendment), on the grounds that it's not a threat to anyone's safety unless she chooses to break the law. \n\nWell, grenade launchers are actually legal with the appropriate tax stamps.  I just said that they aren't protected by the second amendment, which they aren't.  Lots of things are legal which aren't protected by the constitution.\n\nShe can own a grenade launcher, and it's not a threat to anyone's safety unless she chooses to break the law. \n\nYou're correct that she is arguing guns on their merits, and I think she is doing a good job at it.  I'm just here to support her arguments with the constitutional arguments.\n\n&gt;That's your prerogative, but then you might want to reconsider your decision to enter such a debate. \n\nI might reconsider my position if you make the debate interesting :)  So far, I'm hooked.\n\n&gt;The only interesting question is whether those standards are good and deserve to be upheld, and I firmly reject the defeatist notion that we'll never find middle ground.\n\nI haven't seen any arguments from you that those standards are bad and should be struck down with a constitutional amendment.  All you said was that you are personally ambivalent to gun control, and that if people legitimately need a \" military-grade assault rifle\", that we have much bigger problems we need to discuss in our society, which I agreed with.\n\nIncidentally, \"military-grade assault rifles\" have been banned for civilian manufacture and sale since 1986, and they aren't what is being discussed in this round of gun control, we are discussing \"military style assault weapons\", which are not military grade, and are not assault rifles.  They are semi-automatic rifles, functionally no different from hunting rifles which are exempted from the ban.  [Watch this video where a sheriff describes the differences between an assault weapon and a normal hunting rifle, and demonstrates the differences in effectiveness of 10 round magazines vs 30 round magazines in both an assault weapon and an ordinary hunting rifle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=A1bu7Y8iwXA)\n\nI think it's important to be clear on our terminology so we know what we're really talking about.\n\nAnyway, the need argument, we don't ban things just because some of us think that no one needs them.  I don't think anyone needs tobacco, but we still can't ban it, because people want it.  I don't think anyone needs cars that can exceed 100 mph, but we haven't enforced a top speed of 100 mph in all new cars.\n\nThe fact is that some people do think they need these weapons, so even setting aside the constitutional argument, they should not be banned.  Listen to the senate judiciary committee arguments on the AWB and magazine limits, the pro-gun side made the more compelling arguments.\n\n&gt;In fact, I suspect we already agree about most classes of weapons, and we're really only quibbling over a small subset that are legitimately under dispute.\n\nWell, I don't think we'd agree, because I dislike the supreme court's interpretation.  I think the NFA should have been thrown out in US V Miller, and I think we should have a constitutionally protected right to own short barrelled shotguns/rifles, silencers, machine guns, and destructive devices like grenade launchers and grenades.\n\nUnfortunately, we don't have such rights because the US V Miller case was wrongly decided, in my opinion.  However, I can't go back in time and change that, so I must live with the modern day consequences of that decision.\n\n&gt; But don't pretend the only option is to ignore it.\n\nI think the only option is to ignore it because we will not agree, so in the end we must fall back on constitutional arguments.  You are willing to tolerate the prohibition of a class of weapon which is functionally the same as weapons which you don't want to prohibit, while I want to allow unrestricted access to weapons that are functionally much more deadly and dangerous than the ones which are currently unrestricted.\n\nI'm happy you at least seem ambivalent about the ban, but that doesn't make the ban a good idea.\n\n&gt;Don't be silly -- of course someone can do something about it. If you think you have a valid argument, you can raise or support a new legal challenge in the courts that might lead to the precedent being overturned. \n\nExcept that's exceedingly difficult, the lower courts will decide based on DC V Heller, and it will never make it to the supreme court to be overturned.  They would refuse the case, letting the lower court rulings stand.  It's not easy to directly contradict a prior ruling, they must take prior rulings into consideration in all new decisions.\n\n&gt;You can try to amend the constitution.\n\nAlso exceedingly difficult.  Good luck getting 3/4 of the states to ratify.\n\n&gt;Or you can craft a more narrowly tailored policy that accomplishes similar goals while fitting inside the boundaries the Supreme Court has laid out.\n\nWell, some politicians can try, and they can be voted out of office for it.  I'm pushing hard for voter turn out in 2014 to vote out all anti-gun legislators from both federal government and state governments.\n\n&gt;Really? What makes you so sure? Polls have shown that somewhere around 44-57% of Americans would favor an assault weapons ban, and a plurality say they'd be more likely to vote for a member of Congress who voted for it.\n\nMost people don't know the definition of an assault weapon.  Even you might fall into that category.  Lots of people mistake them for fully automatic weapons, and don't realize they are functionally the same, and not any more lethal, than hunting weapons which are exempted from the ban.  In fact, there are lots of hunting weapons far more lethal than an AR-15, the AR-15 shoots small bullets designed for people, which are relatively small animals.  Those rounds aren't even legal for deer hunting in some states because it is considered inhumane.  There are MUCH larger and more lethal rounds that can be used in semi-automatic hunting rifles with 30 round magazines and would remain legal because they are not classified as \"assault weapons\".\n\nAnyway, it takes a lot more than 57% to get something done.  Around 70% favored the public option for healthcare, and around 70% favored ending the bush tax cuts for the rich, but we didn't get either of those things.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93m9be", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364420529", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1b46fm", "selftext": "&gt;OP is a female, and she's made it quite clear that she opposes legal abortion.\n\nI am not against abortion.

I was making a distinction between guns you *can* have and guns you *can't* have, because the OP was worried about the lives that would be lost due to lack of access to guns. My point was, if there's some realistic situation in which having only a handgun (an allowed weapon) instead of a military-grade assault weapon (a banned weapon) is going to cost us lives, why aren't we talking about whatever the heck that is? Is it the government sending the Marines to kill someone in their home? Is it a zombie invasion? Whatever it is that's costing lives and too powerful for mere handguns, I'd like to be forewarned.\n\n&gt;  You are willing to tolerate the prohibition of a class of weapon which is functionally the same as weapons which you don't want to prohibit, while I want to allow unrestricted access to weapons that are functionally much more deadly and dangerous than the ones which are currently unrestricted.\n\nI don't believe I ever expressed a personal opinion on the ban.

They won't head to the polls to defend supporters of the law, they'll head to the polls to defend the same candidates they've voted for in the past, and to support the same issues that were important to them in the past. You may have become a single-issue voter, but this will not be a single-issue election. \n\nThe Republicans may very well prevail in 2014. But it won't be because the Democrats sabotaged themselves with gun control, it will be because of the political factors present in midterm elections that you mentioned before.

Many republican and independent voters who wouldn't have even cared about the midterms otherwise are now going to be headed to the polls in 2014, because of this gun control push.\n\nIt's not just one single factor, it's a combination of factors.  For example, I usually don't vote in midterms, but now that I see an assault on my gun rights, I've been motivated not only to vote, but to vote for the opposite party than I would ordinarily vote for.  On top of that, i've been motivated to help convince others to defend their gun rights and vote in 2014 for the GOP as well, and I have convinced a lot of people to do so who also wouldn't have ordinarily voted in the midterms at all.

Like I said, I wasn't planning on voting in the midterm at all up until these gun control pushes.

I don't give pro-life people any slack either, they are just as bad as gun control advocates, they both want to restrict our rights.\n\nAgain, OP never specifically said she was pro-life, and even if she is, it's not relevant to her argument.  The hypocrisy she sees is still valid, even if she is guilty of similar hypocrisy.\n\n&gt;she's even argued she should be able to have a grenade launcher (which you yourself say is not protected by the 2nd amendment), on the grounds that it's not a threat to anyone's safety unless she chooses to break the law. \n\nWell, grenade launchers are actually legal with the appropriate tax stamps.  I just said that they aren't protected by the second amendment, which they aren't.  Lots of things are legal which aren't protected by the constitution.\n\nShe can own a grenade launcher, and it's not a threat to anyone's safety unless she chooses to break the law. \n\nYou're correct that she is arguing guns on their merits, and I think she is doing a good job at it.  I'm just here to support her arguments with the constitutional arguments.\n\n&gt;That's your prerogative, but then you might want to reconsider your decision to enter such a debate. \n\nI might reconsider my position if you make the debate interesting :)  So far, I'm hooked.\n\n&gt;The only interesting question is whether those standards are good and deserve to be upheld, and I firmly reject the defeatist notion that we'll never find middle ground.\n\nI haven't seen any arguments from you that those standards are bad and should be struck down with a constitutional amendment.  All you said was that you are personally ambivalent to gun control, and that if people legitimately need a \" military-grade assault rifle\", that we have much bigger problems we need to discuss in our society, which I agreed with.\n\nIncidentally, \"military-grade assault rifles\" have been banned for civilian manufacture and sale since 1986, and they aren't what is being discussed in this round of gun control, we are discussing \"military style assault weapons\", which are not military grade, and are not assault rifles.  They are semi-automatic rifles, functionally no different from hunting rifles which are exempted from the ban.  [Watch this video where a sheriff describes the differences between an assault weapon and a normal hunting rifle, and demonstrates the differences in effectiveness of 10 round magazines vs 30 round magazines in both an assault weapon and an ordinary hunting rifle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=A1bu7Y8iwXA)\n\nI think it's important to be clear on our terminology so we know what we're really talking about.\n\nAnyway, the need argument, we don't ban things just because some of us think that no one needs them.  I don't think anyone needs tobacco, but we still can't ban it, because people want it.  I don't think anyone needs cars that can exceed 100 mph, but we haven't enforced a top speed of 100 mph in all new cars.\n\nThe fact is that some people do think they need these weapons, so even setting aside the constitutional argument, they should not be banned.  Listen to the senate judiciary committee arguments on the AWB and magazine limits, the pro-gun side made the more compelling arguments.\n\n&gt;In fact, I suspect we already agree about most classes of weapons, and we're really only quibbling over a small subset that are legitimately under dispute.\n\nWell, I don't think we'd agree, because I dislike the supreme court's interpretation.  I think the NFA should have been thrown out in US V Miller, and I think we should have a constitutionally protected right to own short barrelled shotguns/rifles, silencers, machine guns, and destructive devices like grenade launchers and grenades.\n\nUnfortunately, we don't have such rights because the US V Miller case was wrongly decided, in my opinion.  However, I can't go back in time and change that, so I must live with the modern day consequences of that decision.\n\n&gt; But don't pretend the only option is to ignore it.\n\nI think the only option is to ignore it because we will not agree, so in the end we must fall back on constitutional arguments.  You are willing to tolerate the prohibition of a class of weapon which is functionally the same as weapons which you don't want to prohibit, while I want to allow unrestricted access to weapons that are functionally much more deadly and dangerous than the ones which are currently unrestricted.\n\nI'm happy you at least seem ambivalent about the ban, but that doesn't make the ban a good idea.\n\n&gt;Don't be silly -- of course someone can do something about it. If you think you have a valid argument, you can raise or support a new legal challenge in the courts that might lead to the precedent being overturned. \n\nExcept that's exceedingly difficult, the lower courts will decide based on DC V Heller, and it will never make it to the supreme court to be overturned.  They would refuse the case, letting the lower court rulings stand.  It's not easy to directly contradict a prior ruling, they must take prior rulings into consideration in all new decisions.\n\n&gt;You can try to amend the constitution.\n\nAlso exceedingly difficult.  Good luck getting 3/4 of the states to ratify.\n\n&gt;Or you can craft a more narrowly tailored policy that accomplishes similar goals while fitting inside the boundaries the Supreme Court has laid out.\n\nWell, some politicians can try, and they can be voted out of office for it.  I'm pushing hard for voter turn out in 2014 to vote out all anti-gun legislators from both federal government and state governments.\n\n&gt;Really? What makes you so sure? Polls have shown that somewhere around 44-57% of Americans would favor an assault weapons ban, and a plurality say they'd be more likely to vote for a member of Congress who voted for it.\n\nMost people don't know the definition of an assault weapon.  Even you might fall into that category.  Lots of people mistake them for fully automatic weapons, and don't realize they are functionally the same, and not any more lethal, than hunting weapons which are exempted from the ban.  In fact, there are lots of hunting weapons far more lethal than an AR-15, the AR-15 shoots small bullets designed for people, which are relatively small animals.  Those rounds aren't even legal for deer hunting in some states because it is considered inhumane.  There are MUCH larger and more lethal rounds that can be used in semi-automatic hunting rifles with 30 round magazines and would remain legal because they are not classified as \"assault weapons\".\n\nAnyway, it takes a lot more than 57% to get something done.

Obviously I acknowledge that DC v. Heller and McDonald v. Chicago exist. Even vehement gun control proponents do not dispute this, so what's to argue? The only interesting question is whether those standards are good and deserve to be upheld, and I firmly reject the defeatist notion that we'll never find middle ground. In fact, I suspect we already agree about most classes of weapons, and we're really only quibbling over a small subset that are legitimately under dispute.

But don't pretend the only option is to ignore it.\n\n&gt; You don't have to agree, but that doesn't mean you can change it or do anything about it.\n\nDon't be silly -- of course someone can do something about it. If you think you have a valid argument, you can raise or support a new legal challenge in the courts that might lead to the precedent being overturned. You can try to amend the constitution.

You take it as a given that the \"right\" to do X is exactly the same as the \"right\" to do Y, but most people don't think that way and there's no objective reason one can't agree with one \"right\" and disagree with another, on the *merits* of each. \n\n&gt; You're correct that she is arguing guns on their merits, and I think she is doing a good job at it. I'm just here to support her arguments with the constitutional arguments.\n\nNobody disputes that Heller, etc. is the the current judicial precedent, so I'm not sure what support you're hoping to provide.\n\n&gt; I haven't seen any arguments from you that those standards are bad and should be struck down with a constitutional amendment. All you said was that you are personally ambivalent to gun control, and that if people legitimately need a \" military-grade assault rifle\", that we have much bigger problems we need to discuss in our society, which I agreed with.\n\nThat was my argument because that's my position. I *am* personally ambivalent to gun control, and I don't claim to have a firm preference in terms of what those standards should be. I *am* generally favorable toward the right to gun ownership, but I acknowledge that hypothetically, *some* additional restrictions could be beneficial (no, I'm not entirely sure what, but I'm open-minded to ideas and counter-arguments against those ideas). What I disagree firmly with are blanket statements that any and all additional regulations on gun ownership would be bad.\n\n&gt; Incidentally, \"military-grade assault rifles\" have been banned for civilian manufacture and sale since 1986, and they aren't what is being discussed in this round of gun control, we are discussing \"military style assault weapons\", which are not military grade, and are not assault rifles.\n\nYes, I know and agree. I was making a distinction between guns you *can* have and guns you *can't* have, because the OP was worried about the lives that would be lost due to lack of access to guns. My point was, if there's some realistic situation in which having only a handgun (an allowed weapon) instead of a military-grade assault weapon (a banned weapon) is going to cost us lives, why aren't we talking about whatever the heck that is? Is it the government sending the Marines to kill someone in their home? Is it a zombie invasion? Whatever it is that's costing lives and too powerful for mere handguns, I'd like to be forewarned.\n\n&gt;  You are willing to tolerate the prohibition of a class of weapon which is functionally the same as weapons which you don't want to prohibit, while I want to allow unrestricted access to weapons that are functionally much more deadly and dangerous than the ones which are currently unrestricted.\n\nI don't believe I ever expressed a personal opinion on the ban. My argument was only that, in principle, *some weapons* are dangerous enough to ban, and that *proponents of the AWB* believe that includes this type of weapon. I was quibbling with the OP's sweeping blanket statements.\n\n&gt; Except that's exceedingly difficult, the lower courts will decide based on DC V Heller, and it will never make it to the supreme court to be overturned. They would refuse the case, letting the lower court rulings stand. It's not easy to directly contradict a prior ruling, they must take prior rulings into consideration in all new decisions. Also exceedingly difficult. Good luck getting 3/4 of the states to ratify.\n\nOf course it's difficult. So what? We can't even discuss what's good and bad because it's *hard* to make changes? What kind of defeatist attitude is that?\n\n&gt; Most people don't know the definition of an assault weapon.\n\nI agree. But you're the one counting on those ignorant people to defeat lots of incumbents on the basis of this one issue they apparently don't know much about.\n\n&gt; Anyway, it takes a lot more than 57% to get something done. Around 70% favored the public option for healthcare, and around 70% favored ending the bush tax cuts for the rich, but we didn't get either of those things.\n\nThat's just silly. If it took more than 70% public approval to get anything done, then nothing would ever get done. The public isn't that unified about virtually *anything* non-trivial.

The primary damage that has been done is that the democrats have energized the GOP and independents to get out and vote in larger numbers in 2014.  Many republican and independent voters who wouldn't have even cared about the midterms otherwise are now going to be headed to the polls in 2014, because of this gun control push.\n\nIt's not just one single factor, it's a combination of factors.  For example, I usually don't vote in midterms, but now that I see an assault on my gun rights, I've been motivated not only to vote, but to vote for the opposite party than I would ordinarily vote for.  On top of that, i've been motivated to help convince others to defend their gun rights and vote in 2014 for the GOP as well, and I have convinced a lot of people to do so who also wouldn't have ordinarily voted in the midterms at all.  So I am impacting much more than just a single vote.\n\n&gt;These Democrats, who as you say realize this law will make no difference, will vote based on other issues, just as they did before Sandy when no one was talking about gun control. \n\nThey will indeed, but in their standard tiny numbers for a midterm.  Meanwhile, the gun control pushes have motivated the GOP voters, along with some new converts like myself, to vote in higher than normal numbers.\n\nI still maintain that gun control has made an impact, and will do significant damage to the democrats in 2014.\n\n&gt;But it won't be because the Democrats sabotaged themselves with gun control,\n\nThat will be part of the reason, we just seem to disagree on the magnitude of the difference it will make.  You acknowledge that some voters like myself will switch, but you've ignored the impact gun control will have on republican turnout.\n\n&gt;The gun control debate is not going to affect Democratic voter turnout one way or the other. \n\nIt may not seriously impact democratic turnout, the major impact will be on republican turnout.  Like I said, I wasn't planning on voting in the midterm at all up until these gun control pushes.  The people who ordinarily vote in midterms for democrats will probably still do so, but many democratic and republican voters, and independents, will be motivated to vote because of this issue when otherwise they would not have voted at all.\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9461qc", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364498103", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "kamahaoma", "id": "t1_c943ioh", "parent_id": "t1_c942r5l", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431732330, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c943ioh", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364489628", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "LogicalWhiteKnight", "id": "t1_c942r5l", "parent_id": "t1_c93rjrr", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431731954, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't think you understand how midterms work.

You're right that *she* is probably female, but she never specifically says that.  She also never said she is against abortion being legal, despite implying that she thinks it's odd that she has that right.\n\n&gt;If the only issue is hypocrisy, then aren't you forced to conclude that gun rights advocates who are also pro-life are hypocrites by the same logic\n\nWell, I think people who are pro-life are advocating for an appalling restriction of rights, and yes, if they are pro-gun I see that as hypocrisy.  I don't give pro-life people any slack either, they are just as bad as gun control advocates, they both want to restrict our rights.\n\nAgain, OP never specifically said she was pro-life, and even if she is, it's not relevant to her argument.  The hypocrisy she sees is still valid, even if she is guilty of similar hypocrisy.\n\n&gt;she's even argued she should be able to have a grenade launcher (which you yourself say is not protected by the 2nd amendment), on the grounds that it's not a threat to anyone's safety unless she chooses to break the law. \n\nWell, grenade launchers are actually legal with the appropriate tax stamps.  I just said that they aren't protected by the second amendment, which they aren't.  Lots of things are legal which aren't protected by the constitution.\n\nShe can own a grenade launcher, and it's not a threat to anyone's safety unless she chooses to break the law. \n\nYou're correct that she is arguing guns on their merits, and I think she is doing a good job at it.  I'm just here to support her arguments with the constitutional arguments.\n\n&gt;That's your prerogative, but then you might want to reconsider your decision to enter such a debate. \n\nI might reconsider my position if you make the debate interesting :)  So far, I'm hooked.\n\n&gt;The only interesting question is whether those standards are good and deserve to be upheld, and I firmly reject the defeatist notion that we'll never find middle ground.\n\nI haven't seen any arguments from you that those standards are bad and should be struck down with a constitutional amendment.  All you said was that you are personally ambivalent to gun control, and that if people legitimately need a \" military-grade assault rifle\", that we have much bigger problems we need to discuss in our society, which I agreed with.\n\nIncidentally, \"military-grade assault rifles\" have been banned for civilian manufacture and sale since 1986, and they aren't what is being discussed in this round of gun control, we are discussing \"military style assault weapons\", which are not military grade, and are not assault rifles.  They are semi-automatic rifles, functionally no different from hunting rifles which are exempted from the ban.  [Watch this video where a sheriff describes the differences between an assault weapon and a normal hunting rifle, and demonstrates the differences in effectiveness of 10 round magazines vs 30 round magazines in both an assault weapon and an ordinary hunting rifle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=A1bu7Y8iwXA)\n\nI think it's important to be clear on our terminology so we know what we're really talking about.\n\nAnyway, the need argument, we don't ban things just because some of us think that no one needs them.  I don't think anyone needs tobacco, but we still can't ban it, because people want it.  I don't think anyone needs cars that can exceed 100 mph, but we haven't enforced a top speed of 100 mph in all new cars.\n\nThe fact is that some people do think they need these weapons, so even setting aside the constitutional argument, they should not be banned.  Listen to the senate judiciary committee arguments on the AWB and magazine limits, the pro-gun side made the more compelling arguments.\n\n&gt;In fact, I suspect we already agree about most classes of weapons, and we're really only quibbling over a small subset that are legitimately under dispute.\n\nWell, I don't think we'd agree, because I dislike the supreme court's interpretation.  I think the NFA should have been thrown out in US V Miller, and I think we should have a constitutionally protected right to own short barrelled shotguns/rifles, silencers, machine guns, and destructive devices like grenade launchers and grenades.\n\nUnfortunately, we don't have such rights because the US V Miller case was wrongly decided, in my opinion.  However, I can't go back in time and change that, so I must live with the modern day consequences of that decision.\n\n&gt; But don't pretend the only option is to ignore it.\n\nI think the only option is to ignore it because we will not agree, so in the end we must fall back on constitutional arguments.  You are willing to tolerate the prohibition of a class of weapon which is functionally the same as weapons which you don't want to prohibit, while I want to allow unrestricted access to weapons that are functionally much more deadly and dangerous than the ones which are currently unrestricted.\n\nI'm happy you at least seem ambivalent about the ban, but that doesn't make the ban a good idea.\n\n&gt;Don't be silly -- of course someone can do something about it. If you think you have a valid argument, you can raise or support a new legal challenge in the courts that might lead to the precedent being overturned. \n\nExcept that's exceedingly difficult, the lower courts will decide based on DC V Heller, and it will never make it to the supreme court to be overturned.  They would refuse the case, letting the lower court rulings stand.  It's not easy to directly contradict a prior ruling, they must take prior rulings into consideration in all new decisions.\n\n&gt;You can try to amend the constitution.\n\nAlso exceedingly difficult.  Good luck getting 3/4 of the states to ratify.\n\n&gt;Or you can craft a more narrowly tailored policy that accomplishes similar goals while fitting inside the boundaries the Supreme Court has laid out.\n\nWell, some politicians can try, and they can be voted out of office for it.  I'm pushing hard for voter turn out in 2014 to vote out all anti-gun legislators from both federal government and state governments.\n\n&gt;Really? What makes you so sure? Polls have shown that somewhere around 44-57% of Americans would favor an assault weapons ban, and a plurality say they'd be more likely to vote for a member of Congress who voted for it.\n\nMost people don't know the definition of an assault weapon.  Even you might fall into that category.  Lots of people mistake them for fully automatic weapons, and don't realize they are functionally the same, and not any more lethal, than hunting weapons which are exempted from the ban.  In fact, there are lots of hunting weapons far more lethal than an AR-15, the AR-15 shoots small bullets designed for people, which are relatively small animals.  Those rounds aren't even legal for deer hunting in some states because it is considered inhumane.  There are MUCH larger and more lethal rounds that can be used in semi-automatic hunting rifles with 30 round magazines and would remain legal because they are not classified as \"assault weapons\".\n\nAnyway, it takes a lot more than 57% to get something done.

The OP was not complaining about abortion, the OP was complaining that so many people want to ban assault weapons, which he sees as an infringement of his constitutional rights.\n\nOP never said he disagrees with Roe V Wade, or that abortion shouldn't be a constitutionally protected right.  He is saying that since it is a constitutionally protected right, he considers it hypocritical that abortion supporters are often the same people who support an assault weapon ban, something he sees as a violation of a constitutional right, protected by DC V Heller.\n\n&gt; It does not necessarily define what is reasonable, just, fair, appropriate, or best. If you want to argue what is inherently \"good\" or \"bad,\" you have to make a different sort of argument.\n\nCertainly, but that's not really the argument at hand here.  We can go down that road, but it's a long one, and I don't think I have time for that sort of debate right now.  I have engaged in that debate many times.  Since we probably won't agree on whether access to assault weapons is \"good\" or \"bad\", we'll just have to stick to legal constitutional arguments.\n\n&gt;Why should we assume that \"what the supreme court said\" automatically aligns with what \"should\" be the case?\n\nYou don't have to agree, but that doesn't mean you can change it or do anything about it.  You must accept people's rights whether you like them or not.  Kansas can't close their last abortion clinic, even though they desperately want to, because of Roe V Wade.  In the same way, NY can't enforce their SAFE act, even though they want to, because it violates the constitutional rights of their citizens.  That's why they will lose their court challenge on that law.\n\n&gt;Do you automatically support every single decision the Supreme Court makes? \n\nOf course not, but we can't infringe on the rights they interpret as being protected, even if we disagree.\n\n&gt;To put it another way, suppose the debate was over banning assault weapons with a constitutional amendment.   What the Supreme Court said about the 2nd amendment is irrelevant in that case, so you'll have to defend your preferred policy on its actual merits rather than just parroting the currently prevailing jurisprudential test.\n\nSure, legislators could put forth such an amendment, and it would be debated on it's merits.  If you are interested in debate on the merits of the assault weapon ban, the senate judiciary committee hearings on it were very interesting, and gave arguments on both sides.\n\nSuch an amendment would fail on it's merits, and the legislators who proposed and supported it would face difficult re-election campaigns.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1b46fm", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93jjs4", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364413438", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Doctor_Worm", "id": "t1_c93j8y2", "parent_id": "t1_c93iq14", "score": 6, "retrieved_on": 1431722471, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1b46fm", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93j8y2", "author_flair_text": "[PhD Student: Political Science][Center-Left]", "created_utc": "1364412671", "distinguished": null, "ups": 6}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c93iq14", "parent_id": "t1_c93hqls", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431722215, "controversiality": 1, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": 1370417358, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93iq14", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364411327", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Doctor_Worm", "id": "t1_c93hqls", "parent_id": "t3_1b46fm", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431721687, "controversiality": 1, "edited": 1364409432, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1b46fm", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93hqls", "author_flair_text": "[PhD Student: Political Science][Center-Left]", "created_utc": "1364408786", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}
