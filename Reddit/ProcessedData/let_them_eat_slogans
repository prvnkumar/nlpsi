{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Canadian, actually. And I don't care about questions of morality when it comes to international relations theory. As far as I'm concerned morals don't really matter, power matters. \n\nI find this interesting.  Would I be correct in assuming you reject any morality-related concepts like human rights or war crimes?  If you accept that international politics are \"might makes right\" this seems to be incomparable with any sort of human rights advocacy.\n\nBasically the idea that morality ought to be ignored in foreign policy strikes me as deeply immoral, not simply amoral.  It seems capable of excusing any behaviour, no matter how reprehensible, if it can be framed as needed for the greater good.", "id": "t1_cd7mt02", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "let_them_eat_slogans", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "It's very common to critique the realist school of international relations by aiming for the normative/moralistic bone, basically because realism isn't equipped to handle those questions. So when I put my realist cap on to perform foreign policy analyses, power becomes my focus and I essentially shun questions of ethics/morals. Now, I don't view it as immoral, so much as amoral and we'll have to agree to disagree on it since I'm guessing it largely comes down to philosophical differences. My education was hugely impacted by writers like Hobbes and Machiavelli, and my research has largely focused on some pretty awful things (in moral terms). So it shouldn't be an awful surprise that I can 'switch off' concerns of morality for the purpose of doing this sort of thing.\n\nI guess my personal approach is that if someone wants to make ethics and morals the focus of their research, they are free to worry about those things. Morals and ethics are rarely a concern to my work.\n\n&gt;might makes right\" this seems to be incomparable with any sort of human rights advocacy.\n\nSort of. A lot of realists find ways to justify interventions to prevent human rights atrocities like genocide through other means. For instance, instead of arguing for intervention based on human rights violations, a realist (of most variations) might argue intervention is required to maintain regional stability and local balances of power. The human rights concerns just happen to end up as a happy by-product of maintaining the balance of power/regional stability. Also, the intervening states need some sort of interest in doing so. So if regional stability is in the interest of say, France, the French will intervene (like Mali), if it's not - they won't (like Rwanda). The protection of human rights is incidental to the larger picture.\n\nNow, this doesn't always happen. Rwanda, Darfur and a few other human rights abuses have gone unattended. This only reinforces the idea if no state finds it in their interests to stop genocide, they simply won't. It's terrible, but it sort of goes towards proving that the international system doesn't give two shakes about what is 'right', they care about what's in it for them.\n\nYou might also find it interesting that I'm a gay, Canadian that subscribes to realpolitik in international affairs... I have a fun time putting on my realpolitik analyst hat and surprising people.\n\nAnyway, tl;dr - Sort of. I see it as being indifferent to morality as part of the analysis, it doesn't necessarily reflect my personal views all the time.

You move to a town, armed with your anti-discrim. laws, and discover that despite legal prohibitions from refusing you a job, trade, etc., 95% of the town thought you were bad for your love of anti-discrim. laws, excluded you from everything they legally could, and socially ostracized you. Every protected trade was accompanied by \"Here's your change you statist fiend may you fry in egalitarian hell.\" How happy would you be to mutually benefit the townsfolk w/ the trade of the limited time of your life? Like I said, my first move on encountering organized bigotry you fear, with or without the presence of anti-discrimination laws, would be to leave. \n\nSo my point is that the anti-discrimination laws provide no relevant benefit over the proposed change. The point is moot.\n\nReally my objection to your thought here is that anti-discrimination laws through the agency of allowing gov't to deny freedom of association offer at best minor protection from the force of ostracism  a group could deploy against any minority. There's a big cost and a minor benefit, incredibly minor as it wouldn't change my behavior in the least.\n\nMore importantly, you completely dodged the fact that **without** anti-discimination laws, your fears about some community completely freezing out a given group have already proven ahistorical. Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher.

Yes, it would be a wanton denial of association. A wild, blood bath of refusal of trade. And that crazed lunatic would still face the open censure of everyone who thought that mindset was stupid, and the implicit cost of loss of business. It's not like there's a lot of history here, about how people can prosper in hostile majority societies and boycotts can negatively impact bigoted businesses.\n\n&gt;As long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.\n\nNo, even a freed slave in the deep South would have seen a benefit from increased buying power, especially them actually.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Yup.

It's called a counter-example to your hypothesis. **What you claim will happen in the absence of laws that weren't passed until the 60's, historically did not happen.** The Jews did fine internationally right up until two governmental entities decided depriving them of the NEGATIVE rights was a good idea. Lack of community with people who hated them never appeared to be particularly hurtful to the Jewish community. They just went ahead and found useful, well paying jobs to learn and excel at.

Also, it's a lot harder to perpetuate racist culture when you can't marginalize and dehumanize and separate the \"other.\"  Joe Racist is probably going to get over his affliction faster if he has to deal with the cognitive dissonance of working alongside an equally capable \"other.\"  It's a lot easier to believe and perpetuate damaging nonsense about other groups when you don't have to ever see them or deal with them.\n\n&gt; 2) Because that's EXACTLY what happened to the Jewish diaspora you keep ignoring.

Lack of community with people who hated them never appeared to be particularly hurtful to the Jewish community. They just went ahead and found useful, well paying jobs to learn and excel at.

Those with the highest socioeconomic status would enjoy them disproportionately, with marginalized minority groups at their mercy.  (I guess this is the idea?

People stratify right now to avoid that. The *first* thing I would do upon encountering a large group of people who were anti-me would be to get my family and me the hell away from them.\n\nThe people who've hated Jewish people have tended to hate them because among other things they are often hard workers, gravitate to jobs in demand and earn a lot of money even as they're being discriminated against. That's been the case for a looong time before the civil rights movement in the 60's. Jewish folks didn't have religious strictures against lending at interest; their relative freedom of contract led to material success; they tended to become doctors, lawyers and other skilled professional jobs with high earning potential and they did this for a long time before any laws tried to codify anti-discrimination.\n\nI'd prefer bigotry out in the open, to the hidden, de facto racism that you are powerless to stop anyway. At least then we'd have an open debate, rather than a bunch of embittered bigots going right on with their messed up epistemology but hidden beneath a veneer of compliance. In this tolerant paradise the 60's civil rights laws have created, 60 years later, people still gravitate to like ethnic communities and I still encounter overt, ugly racism, sexism, etc., on a daily basis. I can tell you for a FACT that if we'd spent 60 years teaching logic as a core curriculum to kids in public school, racism would be a bizarre memory.\n\nThe problem with racism isn't the behavior, it's the mindset that underlies it. You're obsessed with the symptoms of it, when by and large the nastiest symptoms are already outlawed. You can't stab a Jewish person because you hate them; that's morally impermissible in all cases, and illegal for centuries. Refusing to do business just let's them know who their enemies are. How much easier to put a face on bigotry and stigmatize it than if you publicized some fool refusing to serve X group?\n\nAnd yes, just like now in the status quo, the richest can pay for more material benefits.

Every protected trade was accompanied by \"Here's your change you statist fiend may you fry in egalitarian hell.\" How happy would you be to mutually benefit the townsfolk w/ the trade of the limited time of your life? Like I said, my first move on encountering organized bigotry you fear, with or without the presence of anti-discrimination laws, would be to leave. \n\nSo my point is that the anti-discrimination laws provide no relevant benefit over the proposed change. The point is moot.\n\nReally my objection to your thought here is that anti-discrimination laws through the agency of allowing gov't to deny freedom of association offer at best minor protection from the force of ostracism  a group could deploy against any minority. There's a big cost and a minor benefit, incredibly minor as it wouldn't change my behavior in the least.\n\nMore importantly, you completely dodged the fact that **without** anti-discimination laws, your fears about some community completely freezing out a given group have already proven ahistorical. Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher. I'm not saying to reject AD laws because they don't eliminate all bigotry. I'm saying reject them because they eliminate so little bigotry they aren't worth the cost.\n\n&gt;is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without \n&gt;fear of consequence.\n\nRunning amok is a ludicrous phrase here. Yes, it would be a wanton denial of association. A wild, blood bath of refusal of trade. And that crazed lunatic would still face the open censure of everyone who thought that mindset was stupid, and the implicit cost of loss of business. It's not like there's a lot of history here, about how people can prosper in hostile majority societies and boycotts can negatively impact bigoted businesses.\n\n&gt;As long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.\n\nNo, even a freed slave in the deep South would have seen a benefit from increased buying power, especially them actually.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Yup.

The *first* thing I would do upon encountering a large group of people who were anti-me would be to get my family and me the hell away from them.\n\nThe people who've hated Jewish people have tended to hate them because among other things they are often hard workers, gravitate to jobs in demand and earn a lot of money even as they're being discriminated against. That's been the case for a looong time before the civil rights movement in the 60's. Jewish folks didn't have religious strictures against lending at interest; their relative freedom of contract led to material success; they tended to become doctors, lawyers and other skilled professional jobs with high earning potential and they did this for a long time before any laws tried to codify anti-discrimination.\n\nI'd prefer bigotry out in the open, to the hidden, de facto racism that you are powerless to stop anyway.

Every protected trade was accompanied by \"Here's your change you statist fiend may you fry in egalitarian hell.\" How happy would you be to mutually benefit the townsfolk w/ the trade of the limited time of your life? Like I said, my first move on encountering organized bigotry you fear, with or without the presence of anti-discrimination laws, would be to leave. \n\nSo my point is that the anti-discrimination laws provide no relevant benefit over the proposed change. The point is moot.\n\nReally my objection to your thought here is that anti-discrimination laws through the agency of allowing gov't to deny freedom of association offer at best minor protection from the force of ostracism  a group could deploy against any minority. There's a big cost and a minor benefit, incredibly minor as it wouldn't change my behavior in the least.\n\nMore importantly, you completely dodged the fact that **without** anti-discimination laws, your fears about some community completely freezing out a given group have already proven ahistorical. Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns.

I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher.

I'm saying reject them because they eliminate so little bigotry they aren't worth the cost.\n\n&gt;is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without \n&gt;fear of consequence.\n\nRunning amok is a ludicrous phrase here. Yes, it would be a wanton denial of association. A wild, blood bath of refusal of trade. And that crazed lunatic would still face the open censure of everyone who thought that mindset was stupid, and the implicit cost of loss of business. It's not like there's a lot of history here, about how people can prosper in hostile majority societies and boycotts can negatively impact bigoted businesses.\n\n&gt;As long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.\n\nNo, even a freed slave in the deep South would have seen a benefit from increased buying power, especially them actually.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Yup.

You are living in a fantasy regarding the content and effect of anti-discrimination laws. \n\nThis is the nirvana fallacy.  You keep using it.  It's not a convincing argument.  How am I living in a fantasy?  Anti-discrimination legislation forces people to hide their discrimination or stop doing it.  This reduces discrimination.  It doesn't eliminate it.  And your alternative simply allows discrimination to run rampant and unchecked like in the 'good old days.'  Count me out.\n\n&gt; You've misunderstood entirely but I can't even lead you to the morally relevant difference between harm and inaction, so this is clearly beyond my capacity.\n\nNo, I think it's just different values.

What's the BEST thing about your ideal society? \n\nIt would be a society predicated on respect for the dignity of your fellows rather than some might makes right majoritarian free for all? I mean that sounds bettter to me, at least. Maybe you like the majority asserting physical ownership over every dissenting minority. Personally that seems much shittier than being legally debarred from forcing *anyone* to do *anything* they wouldn't agree to do.\n\nIt's just a difference in focus. I want to treat all of the choices of my fellow adults with respect and dignity whether or not I agree with them, you want the presumed but false safety of an overlord dictating what adults are allowed to do, as if the overlords are somehow beyond the petty concerns of mere mortals.\n\nPositive rights paradigms lead to the same irresolvable conflicts as between church and gay rights. If we both have a right to be provided food or medical care, and there is only X amount to go around, someone's rights will be devalued. Negative rights paradigms entail no conflicts.

That means wrong, in case that was too oblique.\n\n&gt;Is there anything you're offering me that I would really want? Or do \n&gt;I have to totally reconsider my entire worldview and what I value in \n&gt;life before I start to want the same things you want?\n\nBecause your worldview is either necessarily correct or just too much to bother with investigating? Gotta say neither choice there sounds too swift to me. In short, yes, I think many political disagreements occur because of very fundamental disagreements in ethics, epistemology or metaphysical assumptions.\n\n&gt;This is the nirvana fallacy.\n\nNo it isn't. It is pointing out that the mitigated value of forcing people to hide prejudice, while not stopping them from practicing it anyway, costs more than the benefit to be gained from respecting the rights of free association and contract. ", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;  the benefit to be gained\n\nWhat benefit?

Anything short of that and the gov't is still has authority over you even if it presents no harm to anyone else.\n\n- No gov't intervention in trade; no import or export tariffs; prices drop and bureaucratic control [and cost] withers. No transfer payments. No Fed. Prices would drop for almost everything. Buying power would increase. Since they have the least money, the poor would see the most gain from this.\n\n- Elimination of all inter- and intrastate trade barriers. Drops in health care insurance as markets open up to interstate competition. Drops in energy costs as state mandated energy monopolies go away. Elimination of all national and state monopolies and cartels, again causing a general price decrease.\n\n- The elimination of gov't interference in economy would also eliminate the motive to corrupt officials. If you remove the money from their purview, there's no more point in dumping all that cash into bribes, political advertising, etc.\n\n- Unions lose ability to legally force unionization, but gain right to strike at will. NLRB goes away with attendant budget savings.\n\n- You'd be able to eat, smoke or drink anything you wanted; socially we'd save the cost of the war on drugs, associated imprisonment, related gang violence, etc.\n\n- You'd be able to freely interact with anyone you wanted, however you wanted, in any manner you wanted and to which you could get them to agree. Legalization of prostitution, nullification of sodomy laws, public decency laws, etc. Nullification of any law preventing gambling. No more cartel influence over state gambling licensing.\n\n- Gov't itself would shrink massively. All that money would go back into productive segments of the economy; all the money blown on compliance, regulation, administration, enforcement, etc. of interventionism and welfare statism would go away, further contributing to both price drops and national productivity.\n\nThat should be enough of a laundry list. All in all I've detailed trillions of dollars in savings, large gains in personal autonomy, decrease in crime rates, imprisonment and a massive overall increase in both personal buying power and national productivity that would result.

There are a few good things: ending the war on drugs, mainly.  However, we can end the war on drugs without a return to rampant and open racism, sexism, etc. and the sacrifice of the basic human rights like healthcare that I have come to enjoy.  \n\nFurthermore, the \"benefits\" you describe would be conditional.  Those with the highest socioeconomic status would enjoy them disproportionately, with marginalized minority groups at their mercy.  (I guess this is the idea?  In your society, if a town didn't like Jews the Jews would pretty much be expected to leave town?

If you are envisioning group X being ostracized, why would group X want to live with, socialize with and benefit a community mostly composed of people who hated them and tried to marginalize them? People stratify right now to avoid that. The *first* thing I would do upon encountering a large group of people who were anti-me would be to get my family and me the hell away from them.\n\nThe people who've hated Jewish people have tended to hate them because among other things they are often hard workers, gravitate to jobs in demand and earn a lot of money even as they're being discriminated against. That's been the case for a looong time before the civil rights movement in the 60's. Jewish folks didn't have religious strictures against lending at interest; their relative freedom of contract led to material success; they tended to become doctors, lawyers and other skilled professional jobs with high earning potential and they did this for a long time before any laws tried to codify anti-discrimination.\n\nI'd prefer bigotry out in the open, to the hidden, de facto racism that you are powerless to stop anyway. At least then we'd have an open debate, rather than a bunch of embittered bigots going right on with their messed up epistemology but hidden beneath a veneer of compliance. In this tolerant paradise the 60's civil rights laws have created, 60 years later, people still gravitate to like ethnic communities and I still encounter overt, ugly racism, sexism, etc., on a daily basis. I can tell you for a FACT that if we'd spent 60 years teaching logic as a core curriculum to kids in public school, racism would be a bizarre memory.\n\nThe problem with racism isn't the behavior, it's the mindset that underlies it. You're obsessed with the symptoms of it, when by and large the nastiest symptoms are already outlawed. You can't stab a Jewish person because you hate them; that's morally impermissible in all cases, and illegal for centuries. Refusing to do business just let's them know who their enemies are. How much easier to put a face on bigotry and stigmatize it than if you publicized some fool refusing to serve X group?\n\nAnd yes, just like now in the status quo, the richest can pay for more material benefits. So that's a wash. Although as I pointed out, an increase in buying power will disproportionately benefit the poor, due to the diminishing marginal utility of cash.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1cxzw6", "selftext": "&gt; There wouldn't be a local group \"in power,\" that's the point. \n\nWho is going to stop them?\n\n&gt; Anyone who could pay would have the right to buy whatever house they wanted.

And ideally the Jews would just leave in such a situation.\n\n&gt; In this tolerant paradise the 60's civil rights laws have created, 60 years later, people still gravitate to like ethnic communities and I still encounter overt, ugly racism, sexism, etc., on a daily basis\n\nSo what?  It's way better than it used to be.  Pay gaps are narrowing.  Minority groups can actually get jobs.\n\nAnd are you seriously reminding me that racism still exists?  **I know racism still exists.  I know anti-discrimination laws don't eliminate 100% of racism.** Stop appealing to the Nirvana fallacy, it isn't convincing.  If you want to make the argument that the laws don't work, then make it.

But a secret racist who faces a threat of punishment whenever he tries to be racist in a recognizable way that affects other people is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without fear of consequence.\n\n&gt; Although as I pointed out, an increase in buying power will disproportionately benefit the poor, due to the diminishing marginal utility of cash.\n\nAs long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;So just to be clear: in your ideal society, if a town dislikes Jews, it is \n&gt;within their rights to openly drive all the Jews out of town through \n&gt;socioeconomic pressure.

You move to a town, armed with your anti-discrim. laws, and discover that despite legal prohibitions from refusing you a job, trade, etc., 95% of the town thought you were bad for your love of anti-discrim. laws, excluded you from everything they legally could, and socially ostracized you. Every protected trade was accompanied by \"Here's your change you statist fiend may you fry in egalitarian hell.\" How happy would you be to mutually benefit the townsfolk w/ the trade of the limited time of your life? Like I said, my first move on encountering organized bigotry you fear, with or without the presence of anti-discrimination laws, would be to leave. \n\nSo my point is that the anti-discrimination laws provide no relevant benefit over the proposed change. The point is moot.\n\nReally my objection to your thought here is that anti-discrimination laws through the agency of allowing gov't to deny freedom of association offer at best minor protection from the force of ostracism  a group could deploy against any minority. There's a big cost and a minor benefit, incredibly minor as it wouldn't change my behavior in the least.\n\nMore importantly, you completely dodged the fact that **without** anti-discimination laws, your fears about some community completely freezing out a given group have already proven ahistorical. Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher. I'm not saying to reject AD laws because they don't eliminate all bigotry. I'm saying reject them because they eliminate so little bigotry they aren't worth the cost.\n\n&gt;is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without \n&gt;fear of consequence.\n\nRunning amok is a ludicrous phrase here. Yes, it would be a wanton denial of association. A wild, blood bath of refusal of trade. And that crazed lunatic would still face the open censure of everyone who thought that mindset was stupid, and the implicit cost of loss of business. It's not like there's a lot of history here, about how people can prosper in hostile majority societies and boycotts can negatively impact bigoted businesses.\n\n&gt;As long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.\n\nNo, even a freed slave in the deep South would have seen a benefit from increased buying power, especially them actually.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Yup.

So what is the bright line for when this apocalypse of economic ostracism would occur sans the 60's Civil Rights era? A century wasn't enough.\n\n&gt;What historical counter-examples? Where?\n\nSo you really don't get it? Interesting. *What* would be the Jewish people I've mentioned about 500 times and their startling [at least for you] economic success **prior to anti-discrimination laws** and *where* would be basically worldwide. I mean you had Marx blathering on about \"The Jewish Question\" in the mid 1800's so it's really been a while now.\n\nSince they didn't get driven out of the countries where they lived for so long that, as a community they got wealthy producing bankers, doctors and lawyers, I am wondering where that leaves your theory about what will inevitably happen to minorities living in hostile majorities.\n\n&gt;I'm not sure what I'm missing here. Why did segregation end (or \n&gt;become reduced), in your mind?\n\nYou're missing at least 3 things I see.\n1) Jim Crow laws violated freedom of association\n2) Not even the Deep South produced economic ostracism just segregation.\n3) I have provided a counter-example to your theory that a lack of anti-discrimination laws will result in some type of ostracism driving the minority out of whatever locale.\n\n&gt;This is such a surreal conversation. You're trying to sell me on the \n&gt;wonders of discrimination,\n\nIt's surreal because you are making it surreal by persistent, and I would have thought intentional misunderstanding.\n\nI am trying to sell you on the wonders of freedom by pointing out your fears about what *might* happen if anti-discrimination laws didn't exist are unfounded and historically inaccurate. I mentioned two examples that leapt immediately to mind, the blacks of the deep South and Jews basically everywhere prior to the 1960's. The Jewish people in particular should be recognized by you as a startling counterpoint since as a people they endured such canards as drinking blood and killing Christ while becoming so materially successful they also became the target of conspiracy theories; somehow all managed without the wonderful benefits of your paternalism pretty much worldwide.\n\nIf personal freedom is *nothing* to you, then there's probably little else to discuss.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1cxzw6", "selftext": "&gt; Segregation was a legal position imposed by Jim Crow laws.

It's called a counter-example to your hypothesis. **What you claim will happen in the absence of laws that weren't passed until the 60's, historically did not happen.** The Jews did fine internationally right up until two governmental entities decided depriving them of the NEGATIVE rights was a good idea. Lack of community with people who hated them never appeared to be particularly hurtful to the Jewish community. They just went ahead and found useful, well paying jobs to learn and excel at. When the governments started messing with their negative rights to property, life and liberty, yeah things got ugly then.\n\n&gt;What counter example?\n\nJudaism for the 501st time.\n\n&gt;...except for all the ones that didn't.\n\nMeaning whom? Just asking to make sure that your answer is relevant to the topic at hand, how economic discrimination as permitted by an absence of 60's era civil rights laws is harmful.

That's been the case for a looong time before the civil rights movement in the 60's. Jewish folks didn't have religious strictures against lending at interest; their relative freedom of contract led to material success; they tended to become doctors, lawyers and other skilled professional jobs with high earning potential and they did this for a long time before any laws tried to codify anti-discrimination.\n\nI'd prefer bigotry out in the open, to the hidden, de facto racism that you are powerless to stop anyway.

But a secret racist who faces a threat of punishment whenever he tries to be racist in a recognizable way that affects other people is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without fear of consequence.\n\n&gt; Although as I pointed out, an increase in buying power will disproportionately benefit the poor, due to the diminishing marginal utility of cash.\n\nAs long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;So just to be clear: in your ideal society, if a town dislikes Jews, it is \n&gt;within their rights to openly drive all the Jews out of town through \n&gt;socioeconomic pressure. And ideally the Jews would just leave in \n&gt;such a situation.\n\nIt's in their rights to drive them out through every means but denial of economic association now, which is a lot, sufficient to make me want to leave. You move to a town, armed with your anti-discrim. laws, and discover that despite legal prohibitions from refusing you a job, trade, etc., 95% of the town thought you were bad for your love of anti-discrim. laws, excluded you from everything they legally could, and socially ostracized you. Every protected trade was accompanied by \"Here's your change you statist fiend may you fry in egalitarian hell.\" How happy would you be to mutually benefit the townsfolk w/ the trade of the limited time of your life? Like I said, my first move on encountering organized bigotry you fear, with or without the presence of anti-discrimination laws, would be to leave. \n\nSo my point is that the anti-discrimination laws provide no relevant benefit over the proposed change. The point is moot.\n\nReally my objection to your thought here is that anti-discrimination laws through the agency of allowing gov't to deny freedom of association offer at best minor protection from the force of ostracism  a group could deploy against any minority. There's a big cost and a minor benefit, incredibly minor as it wouldn't change my behavior in the least.\n\nMore importantly, you completely dodged the fact that **without** anti-discimination laws, your fears about some community completely freezing out a given group have already proven ahistorical. Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher. I'm not saying to reject AD laws because they don't eliminate all bigotry. I'm saying reject them because they eliminate so little bigotry they aren't worth the cost.\n\n&gt;is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without \n&gt;fear of consequence.\n\nRunning amok is a ludicrous phrase here. Yes, it would be a wanton denial of association. A wild, blood bath of refusal of trade. And that crazed lunatic would still face the open censure of everyone who thought that mindset was stupid, and the implicit cost of loss of business. It's not like there's a lot of history here, about how people can prosper in hostile majority societies and boycotts can negatively impact bigoted businesses.\n\n&gt;As long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.\n\nNo, even a freed slave in the deep South would have seen a benefit from increased buying power, especially them actually.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Yup.

No transfer payments. No Fed. Prices would drop for almost everything. Buying power would increase. Since they have the least money, the poor would see the most gain from this.\n\n- Elimination of all inter- and intrastate trade barriers. Drops in health care insurance as markets open up to interstate competition. Drops in energy costs as state mandated energy monopolies go away. Elimination of all national and state monopolies and cartels, again causing a general price decrease.\n\n- The elimination of gov't interference in economy would also eliminate the motive to corrupt officials.

Legalization of prostitution, nullification of sodomy laws, public decency laws, etc. Nullification of any law preventing gambling. No more cartel influence over state gambling licensing.\n\n- Gov't itself would shrink massively. All that money would go back into productive segments of the economy; all the money blown on compliance, regulation, administration, enforcement, etc. of interventionism and welfare statism would go away, further contributing to both price drops and national productivity.\n\nThat should be enough of a laundry list.

Those with the highest socioeconomic status would enjoy them disproportionately, with marginalized minority groups at their mercy.  (I guess this is the idea?

People stratify right now to avoid that. The *first* thing I would do upon encountering a large group of people who were anti-me would be to get my family and me the hell away from them.\n\nThe people who've hated Jewish people have tended to hate them because among other things they are often hard workers, gravitate to jobs in demand and earn a lot of money even as they're being discriminated against. That's been the case for a looong time before the civil rights movement in the 60's. Jewish folks didn't have religious strictures against lending at interest; their relative freedom of contract led to material success; they tended to become doctors, lawyers and other skilled professional jobs with high earning potential and they did this for a long time before any laws tried to codify anti-discrimination.\n\nI'd prefer bigotry out in the open, to the hidden, de facto racism that you are powerless to stop anyway. At least then we'd have an open debate, rather than a bunch of embittered bigots going right on with their messed up epistemology but hidden beneath a veneer of compliance. In this tolerant paradise the 60's civil rights laws have created, 60 years later, people still gravitate to like ethnic communities and I still encounter overt, ugly racism, sexism, etc., on a daily basis. I can tell you for a FACT that if we'd spent 60 years teaching logic as a core curriculum to kids in public school, racism would be a bizarre memory.\n\nThe problem with racism isn't the behavior, it's the mindset that underlies it. You're obsessed with the symptoms of it, when by and large the nastiest symptoms are already outlawed. You can't stab a Jewish person because you hate them; that's morally impermissible in all cases, and illegal for centuries. Refusing to do business just let's them know who their enemies are. How much easier to put a face on bigotry and stigmatize it than if you publicized some fool refusing to serve X group?\n\nAnd yes, just like now in the status quo, the richest can pay for more material benefits. So that's a wash.

You move to a town, armed with your anti-discrim. laws, and discover that despite legal prohibitions from refusing you a job, trade, etc., 95% of the town thought you were bad for your love of anti-discrim. laws, excluded you from everything they legally could, and socially ostracized you. Every protected trade was accompanied by \"Here's your change you statist fiend may you fry in egalitarian hell.\" How happy would you be to mutually benefit the townsfolk w/ the trade of the limited time of your life? Like I said, my first move on encountering organized bigotry you fear, with or without the presence of anti-discrimination laws, would be to leave. \n\nSo my point is that the anti-discrimination laws provide no relevant benefit over the proposed change. The point is moot.\n\nReally my objection to your thought here is that anti-discrimination laws through the agency of allowing gov't to deny freedom of association offer at best minor protection from the force of ostracism  a group could deploy against any minority. There's a big cost and a minor benefit, incredibly minor as it wouldn't change my behavior in the least.\n\nMore importantly, you completely dodged the fact that **without** anti-discimination laws, your fears about some community completely freezing out a given group have already proven ahistorical. Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher. I'm not saying to reject AD laws because they don't eliminate all bigotry. I'm saying reject them because they eliminate so little bigotry they aren't worth the cost.\n\n&gt;is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without \n&gt;fear of consequence.\n\nRunning amok is a ludicrous phrase here. Yes, it would be a wanton denial of association. A wild, blood bath of refusal of trade. And that crazed lunatic would still face the open censure of everyone who thought that mindset was stupid, and the implicit cost of loss of business. It's not like there's a lot of history here, about how people can prosper in hostile majority societies and boycotts can negatively impact bigoted businesses.\n\n&gt;As long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.\n\nNo, even a freed slave in the deep South would have seen a benefit from increased buying power, especially them actually.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Yup.

Lack of community with people who hated them never appeared to be particularly hurtful to the Jewish community. They just went ahead and found useful, well paying jobs to learn and excel at.

No transfer payments. No Fed. Prices would drop for almost everything. Buying power would increase. Since they have the least money, the poor would see the most gain from this.\n\n- Elimination of all inter- and intrastate trade barriers. Drops in health care insurance as markets open up to interstate competition. Drops in energy costs as state mandated energy monopolies go away. Elimination of all national and state monopolies and cartels, again causing a general price decrease.\n\n- The elimination of gov't interference in economy would also eliminate the motive to corrupt officials.

Legalization of prostitution, nullification of sodomy laws, public decency laws, etc. Nullification of any law preventing gambling. No more cartel influence over state gambling licensing.\n\n- Gov't itself would shrink massively. All that money would go back into productive segments of the economy; all the money blown on compliance, regulation, administration, enforcement, etc. of interventionism and welfare statism would go away, further contributing to both price drops and national productivity.\n\nThat should be enough of a laundry list.

Those with the highest socioeconomic status would enjoy them disproportionately, with marginalized minority groups at their mercy.  (I guess this is the idea?

People stratify right now to avoid that. The *first* thing I would do upon encountering a large group of people who were anti-me would be to get my family and me the hell away from them.\n\nThe people who've hated Jewish people have tended to hate them because among other things they are often hard workers, gravitate to jobs in demand and earn a lot of money even as they're being discriminated against. That's been the case for a looong time before the civil rights movement in the 60's. Jewish folks didn't have religious strictures against lending at interest; their relative freedom of contract led to material success; they tended to become doctors, lawyers and other skilled professional jobs with high earning potential and they did this for a long time before any laws tried to codify anti-discrimination.\n\nI'd prefer bigotry out in the open, to the hidden, de facto racism that you are powerless to stop anyway. At least then we'd have an open debate, rather than a bunch of embittered bigots going right on with their messed up epistemology but hidden beneath a veneer of compliance.

I can tell you for a FACT that if we'd spent 60 years teaching logic as a core curriculum to kids in public school, racism would be a bizarre memory.\n\nThe problem with racism isn't the behavior, it's the mindset that underlies it. You're obsessed with the symptoms of it, when by and large the nastiest symptoms are already outlawed. You can't stab a Jewish person because you hate them; that's morally impermissible in all cases, and illegal for centuries. Refusing to do business just let's them know who their enemies are. How much easier to put a face on bigotry and stigmatize it than if you publicized some fool refusing to serve X group?\n\nAnd yes, just like now in the status quo, the richest can pay for more material benefits.

Every protected trade was accompanied by \"Here's your change you statist fiend may you fry in egalitarian hell.\" How happy would you be to mutually benefit the townsfolk w/ the trade of the limited time of your life? Like I said, my first move on encountering organized bigotry you fear, with or without the presence of anti-discrimination laws, would be to leave. \n\nSo my point is that the anti-discrimination laws provide no relevant benefit over the proposed change. The point is moot.\n\nReally my objection to your thought here is that anti-discrimination laws through the agency of allowing gov't to deny freedom of association offer at best minor protection from the force of ostracism  a group could deploy against any minority. There's a big cost and a minor benefit, incredibly minor as it wouldn't change my behavior in the least.\n\nMore importantly, you completely dodged the fact that **without** anti-discimination laws, your fears about some community completely freezing out a given group have already proven ahistorical. Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher. I'm not saying to reject AD laws because they don't eliminate all bigotry. I'm saying reject them because they eliminate so little bigotry they aren't worth the cost.\n\n&gt;is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without \n&gt;fear of consequence.\n\nRunning amok is a ludicrous phrase here. Yes, it would be a wanton denial of association. A wild, blood bath of refusal of trade. And that crazed lunatic would still face the open censure of everyone who thought that mindset was stupid, and the implicit cost of loss of business. It's not like there's a lot of history here, about how people can prosper in hostile majority societies and boycotts can negatively impact bigoted businesses.\n\n&gt;As long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.\n\nNo, even a freed slave in the deep South would have seen a benefit from increased buying power, especially them actually.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Yup.

Those with the highest socioeconomic status would enjoy them disproportionately, with marginalized minority groups at their mercy.  (I guess this is the idea?

The *first* thing I would do upon encountering a large group of people who were anti-me would be to get my family and me the hell away from them.\n\nThe people who've hated Jewish people have tended to hate them because among other things they are often hard workers, gravitate to jobs in demand and earn a lot of money even as they're being discriminated against. That's been the case for a looong time before the civil rights movement in the 60's. Jewish folks didn't have religious strictures against lending at interest; their relative freedom of contract led to material success; they tended to become doctors, lawyers and other skilled professional jobs with high earning potential and they did this for a long time before any laws tried to codify anti-discrimination.\n\nI'd prefer bigotry out in the open, to the hidden, de facto racism that you are powerless to stop anyway.

You can't stab a Jewish person because you hate them; that's morally impermissible in all cases, and illegal for centuries. Refusing to do business just let's them know who their enemies are. How much easier to put a face on bigotry and stigmatize it than if you publicized some fool refusing to serve X group?\n\nAnd yes, just like now in the status quo, the richest can pay for more material benefits.

Every protected trade was accompanied by \"Here's your change you statist fiend may you fry in egalitarian hell.\" How happy would you be to mutually benefit the townsfolk w/ the trade of the limited time of your life? Like I said, my first move on encountering organized bigotry you fear, with or without the presence of anti-discrimination laws, would be to leave. \n\nSo my point is that the anti-discrimination laws provide no relevant benefit over the proposed change. The point is moot.\n\nReally my objection to your thought here is that anti-discrimination laws through the agency of allowing gov't to deny freedom of association offer at best minor protection from the force of ostracism  a group could deploy against any minority. There's a big cost and a minor benefit, incredibly minor as it wouldn't change my behavior in the least.\n\nMore importantly, you completely dodged the fact that **without** anti-discimination laws, your fears about some community completely freezing out a given group have already proven ahistorical. Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher.

Yes, it would be a wanton denial of association. A wild, blood bath of refusal of trade. And that crazed lunatic would still face the open censure of everyone who thought that mindset was stupid, and the implicit cost of loss of business.

No transfer payments. No Fed. Prices would drop for almost everything. Buying power would increase. Since they have the least money, the poor would see the most gain from this.\n\n- Elimination of all inter- and intrastate trade barriers. Drops in health care insurance as markets open up to interstate competition. Drops in energy costs as state mandated energy monopolies go away. Elimination of all national and state monopolies and cartels, again causing a general price decrease.\n\n- The elimination of gov't interference in economy would also eliminate the motive to corrupt officials.

Those with the highest socioeconomic status would enjoy them disproportionately, with marginalized minority groups at their mercy.  (I guess this is the idea?

The *first* thing I would do upon encountering a large group of people who were anti-me would be to get my family and me the hell away from them.\n\nThe people who've hated Jewish people have tended to hate them because among other things they are often hard workers, gravitate to jobs in demand and earn a lot of money even as they're being discriminated against. That's been the case for a looong time before the civil rights movement in the 60's. Jewish folks didn't have religious strictures against lending at interest; their relative freedom of contract led to material success; they tended to become doctors, lawyers and other skilled professional jobs with high earning potential and they did this for a long time before any laws tried to codify anti-discrimination.\n\nI'd prefer bigotry out in the open, to the hidden, de facto racism that you are powerless to stop anyway.

You're obsessed with the symptoms of it, when by and large the nastiest symptoms are already outlawed. You can't stab a Jewish person because you hate them; that's morally impermissible in all cases, and illegal for centuries. Refusing to do business just let's them know who their enemies are. How much easier to put a face on bigotry and stigmatize it than if you publicized some fool refusing to serve X group?\n\nAnd yes, just like now in the status quo, the richest can pay for more material benefits.

Every protected trade was accompanied by \"Here's your change you statist fiend may you fry in egalitarian hell.\" How happy would you be to mutually benefit the townsfolk w/ the trade of the limited time of your life? Like I said, my first move on encountering organized bigotry you fear, with or without the presence of anti-discrimination laws, would be to leave. \n\nSo my point is that the anti-discrimination laws provide no relevant benefit over the proposed change. The point is moot.\n\nReally my objection to your thought here is that anti-discrimination laws through the agency of allowing gov't to deny freedom of association offer at best minor protection from the force of ostracism  a group could deploy against any minority. There's a big cost and a minor benefit, incredibly minor as it wouldn't change my behavior in the least.\n\nMore importantly, you completely dodged the fact that **without** anti-discimination laws, your fears about some community completely freezing out a given group have already proven ahistorical. Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher. I'm not saying to reject AD laws because they don't eliminate all bigotry. I'm saying reject them because they eliminate so little bigotry they aren't worth the cost.\n\n&gt;is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without \n&gt;fear of consequence.\n\nRunning amok is a ludicrous phrase here. Yes, it would be a wanton denial of association. A wild, blood bath of refusal of trade. And that crazed lunatic would still face the open censure of everyone who thought that mindset was stupid, and the implicit cost of loss of business. It's not like there's a lot of history here, about how people can prosper in hostile majority societies and boycotts can negatively impact bigoted businesses.\n\n&gt;As long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.\n\nNo, even a freed slave in the deep South would have seen a benefit from increased buying power, especially them actually.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Yup.

Personally I think it's better if minority groups have the same job opportunities as everyone else.  Also, it's a lot harder to perpetuate racist culture when you can't marginalize and dehumanize and separate the \"other.\"  Joe Racist is probably going to get over his affliction faster if he has to deal with the cognitive dissonance of working alongside an equally capable \"other.\"  It's a lot easier to believe and perpetuate damaging nonsense about other groups when you don't have to ever see them or deal with them.\n\n&gt; 2) Because that's EXACTLY what happened to the Jewish diaspora you keep ignoring.

I mentioned two examples that leapt immediately to mind, the blacks of the deep South and Jews basically everywhere prior to the 1960's. The Jewish people in particular should be recognized by you as a startling counterpoint since as a people they endured such canards as drinking blood and killing Christ while becoming so materially successful they also became the target of conspiracy theories; somehow all managed without the wonderful benefits of your paternalism pretty much worldwide.\n\nIf personal freedom is *nothing* to you, then there's probably little else to discuss.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1cxzw6", "selftext": "&gt; Segregation was a legal position imposed by Jim Crow laws.

Not only were they not run out of town as you proposed would be a common occurrence, they prospered. In town after town, century after century, across the world. It's called a counter-example to your hypothesis. **What you claim will happen in the absence of laws that weren't passed until the 60's, historically did not happen.** The Jews did fine internationally right up until two governmental entities decided depriving them of the NEGATIVE rights was a good idea. Lack of community with people who hated them never appeared to be particularly hurtful to the Jewish community. They just went ahead and found useful, well paying jobs to learn and excel at. When the governments started messing with their negative rights to property, life and liberty, yeah things got ugly then.\n\n&gt;What counter example?\n\nJudaism for the 501st time.\n\n&gt;...except for all the ones that didn't.\n\nMeaning whom? Just asking to make sure that your answer is relevant to the topic at hand, how economic discrimination as permitted by an absence of 60's era civil rights laws is harmful. I'm sure you aren't thinking of some governmental program of extermination that is completely irrelevant to the topic at hand.\n\n&gt;The tangible differences I see in your society result in it being harder \n&gt;for me to get a job and easier for me to die. I don't like that.\n\nLife as an adult really is harder. Personal responsibility and decision-making is more difficult than delegating your autonomy to a 3rd party for sure. I think most children can attest to that fact.\n\nReally my only answer to this is that, long term, being an adult is more rewarding. Oh and that authoritarian governments inevitably, throughout human history, turn bad and the liberty ceded to the authority for security bites you in the ass and fails to produce either. That's not a particularly new observation, nor is it one that has any observed counter-examples of which I am aware.\n\nThe incipient bankruptcy of the European [not to mention the American] welfare state should be yet another case in point of the long term lack of feasibility of attempting to guarantee a limitless output of whatever, healthcare, retirement cash, etc., from the limited income

There's a big cost and a minor benefit, incredibly minor as it wouldn't change my behavior in the least.\n\nMore importantly, you completely dodged the fact that **without** anti-discimination laws, your fears about some community completely freezing out a given group have already proven ahistorical. Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher. I'm not saying to reject AD laws because they don't eliminate all bigotry. I'm saying reject them because they eliminate so little bigotry they aren't worth the cost.\n\n&gt;is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without \n&gt;fear of consequence.\n\nRunning amok is a ludicrous phrase here. Yes, it would be a wanton denial of association. A wild, blood bath of refusal of trade. And that crazed lunatic would still face the open censure of everyone who thought that mindset was stupid, and the implicit cost of loss of business. It's not like there's a lot of history here, about how people can prosper in hostile majority societies and boycotts can negatively impact bigoted businesses.\n\n&gt;As long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.\n\nNo, even a freed slave in the deep South would have seen a benefit from increased buying power, especially them actually.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Yup.

What's the BEST thing about your ideal society? \n\nIt would be a society predicated on respect for the dignity of your fellows rather than some might makes right majoritarian free for all? I mean that sounds bettter to me, at least. Maybe you like the majority asserting physical ownership over every dissenting minority. Personally that seems much shittier than being legally debarred from forcing *anyone* to do *anything* they wouldn't agree to do.\n\nIt's just a difference in focus. I want to treat all of the choices of my fellow adults with respect and dignity whether or not I agree with them, you want the presumed but false safety of an overlord dictating what adults are allowed to do, as if the overlords are somehow beyond the petty concerns of mere mortals.\n\nPositive rights paradigms lead to the same irresolvable conflicts as between church and gay rights.

Gotta say neither choice there sounds too swift to me. In short, yes, I think many political disagreements occur because of very fundamental disagreements in ethics, epistemology or metaphysical assumptions.\n\n&gt;This is the nirvana fallacy.\n\nNo it isn't.

Anything short of that and the gov't is still has authority over you even if it presents no harm to anyone else.\n\n- No gov't intervention in trade; no import or export tariffs; prices drop and bureaucratic control [and cost] withers. No transfer payments. No Fed. Prices would drop for almost everything. Buying power would increase. Since they have the least money, the poor would see the most gain from this.\n\n- Elimination of all inter- and intrastate trade barriers. Drops in health care insurance as markets open up to interstate competition. Drops in energy costs as state mandated energy monopolies go away. Elimination of all national and state monopolies and cartels, again causing a general price decrease.\n\n- The elimination of gov't interference in economy would also eliminate the motive to corrupt officials. If you remove the money from their purview, there's no more point in dumping all that cash into bribes, political advertising, etc.\n\n- Unions lose ability to legally force unionization, but gain right to strike at will. NLRB goes away with attendant budget savings.\n\n- You'd be able to eat, smoke or drink anything you wanted; socially we'd save the cost of the war on drugs, associated imprisonment, related gang violence, etc.\n\n- You'd be able to freely interact with anyone you wanted, however you wanted, in any manner you wanted and to which you could get them to agree. Legalization of prostitution, nullification of sodomy laws, public decency laws, etc. Nullification of any law preventing gambling. No more cartel influence over state gambling licensing.\n\n- Gov't itself would shrink massively. All that money would go back into productive segments of the economy; all the money blown on compliance, regulation, administration, enforcement, etc. of interventionism and welfare statism would go away, further contributing to both price drops and national productivity.\n\nThat should be enough of a laundry list. All in all I've detailed trillions of dollars in savings, large gains in personal autonomy, decrease in crime rates, imprisonment and a massive overall increase in both personal buying power and national productivity that would result.

However, we can end the war on drugs without a return to rampant and open racism, sexism, etc. and the sacrifice of the basic human rights like healthcare that I have come to enjoy.  \n\nFurthermore, the \"benefits\" you describe would be conditional.  Those with the highest socioeconomic status would enjoy them disproportionately, with marginalized minority groups at their mercy.  (I guess this is the idea?

People stratify right now to avoid that. The *first* thing I would do upon encountering a large group of people who were anti-me would be to get my family and me the hell away from them.\n\nThe people who've hated Jewish people have tended to hate them because among other things they are often hard workers, gravitate to jobs in demand and earn a lot of money even as they're being discriminated against. That's been the case for a looong time before the civil rights movement in the 60's. Jewish folks didn't have religious strictures against lending at interest; their relative freedom of contract led to material success; they tended to become doctors, lawyers and other skilled professional jobs with high earning potential and they did this for a long time before any laws tried to codify anti-discrimination.\n\nI'd prefer bigotry out in the open, to the hidden, de facto racism that you are powerless to stop anyway. At least then we'd have an open debate, rather than a bunch of embittered bigots going right on with their messed up epistemology but hidden beneath a veneer of compliance. In this tolerant paradise the 60's civil rights laws have created, 60 years later, people still gravitate to like ethnic communities and I still encounter overt, ugly racism, sexism, etc., on a daily basis. I can tell you for a FACT that if we'd spent 60 years teaching logic as a core curriculum to kids in public school, racism would be a bizarre memory.\n\nThe problem with racism isn't the behavior, it's the mindset that underlies it. You're obsessed with the symptoms of it, when by and large the nastiest symptoms are already outlawed. You can't stab a Jewish person because you hate them; that's morally impermissible in all cases, and illegal for centuries. Refusing to do business just let's them know who their enemies are. How much easier to put a face on bigotry and stigmatize it than if you publicized some fool refusing to serve X group?\n\nAnd yes, just like now in the status quo, the richest can pay for more material benefits. So that's a wash.

And ideally the Jews would just leave in such a situation.\n\n&gt; In this tolerant paradise the 60's civil rights laws have created, 60 years later, people still gravitate to like ethnic communities and I still encounter overt, ugly racism, sexism, etc., on a daily basis\n\nSo what?  It's way better than it used to be.  Pay gaps are narrowing.  Minority groups can actually get jobs.\n\nAnd are you seriously reminding me that racism still exists?  **I know racism still exists.

You move to a town, armed with your anti-discrim. laws, and discover that despite legal prohibitions from refusing you a job, trade, etc., 95% of the town thought you were bad for your love of anti-discrim. laws, excluded you from everything they legally could, and socially ostracized you. Every protected trade was accompanied by \"Here's your change you statist fiend may you fry in egalitarian hell.\" How happy would you be to mutually benefit the townsfolk w/ the trade of the limited time of your life? Like I said, my first move on encountering organized bigotry you fear, with or without the presence of anti-discrimination laws, would be to leave. \n\nSo my point is that the anti-discrimination laws provide no relevant benefit over the proposed change. The point is moot.\n\nReally my objection to your thought here is that anti-discrimination laws through the agency of allowing gov't to deny freedom of association offer at best minor protection from the force of ostracism  a group could deploy against any minority. There's a big cost and a minor benefit, incredibly minor as it wouldn't change my behavior in the least.\n\nMore importantly, you completely dodged the fact that **without** anti-discimination laws, your fears about some community completely freezing out a given group have already proven ahistorical. Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher. I'm not saying to reject AD laws because they don't eliminate all bigotry. I'm saying reject them because they eliminate so little bigotry they aren't worth the cost.\n\n&gt;is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without \n&gt;fear of consequence.\n\nRunning amok is a ludicrous phrase here. Yes, it would be a wanton denial of association. A wild, blood bath of refusal of trade. And that crazed lunatic would still face the open censure of everyone who thought that mindset was stupid, and the implicit cost of loss of business. It's not like there's a lot of history here, about how people can prosper in hostile majority societies and boycotts can negatively impact bigoted businesses.\n\n&gt;As long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.\n\nNo, even a freed slave in the deep South would have seen a benefit from increased buying power, especially them actually.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Yup.

Or is it that increased segregation is acceptable or desirable to you?\n\n&gt; Which interestingly didn't happen in the century between the Civil War and the Civil Rights era.\n\nBut interestingly did happen countless times in eras without legal repercussion for discrimination.\n\n&gt; What would be the Jewish people I've mentioned about 500 times and their startling [at least for you] economic success prior to anti-discrimination laws and where would be basically worldwide.\n\nSo you're just saying their success (or of the survivors at least) justifies the discrimination?  Or what?\n\n&gt; You're missing at least 3 things I see. 1) Jim Crow laws violated freedom of association 2) Not even the Deep South produced economic ostracism just segregation. 3) I have provided a counter-example to your theory that a lack of anti-discrimination laws will result in some type of ostracism driving the minority out of whatever locale.\n\nWhat counter example?\n\n&gt; The Jewish people in particular should be recognized by you as a startling counterpoint since as a people they endured such canards as drinking blood and killing Christ while becoming so materially successful they also became the target of conspiracy theories; somehow all managed without the wonderful benefits of your paternalism pretty much worldwide.\n\n...except for all the ones that didn't.\n\n&gt; If personal freedom is nothing to you, then there's probably little else to discuss.\n\nYou're not offering me any \"freedom\" I recognize, it's buzzwords.  You're offering to take away excellent tangible rights I have like healthcare in exchange for increased \"freedom\" that amounts to more leeway to oppress people over who I hold socioeconomic superiority.  There's no benefit.  The tangible differences I see in your society result in it being harder for me to get a job and easier for me to die.

Let me ask: in your \n&gt;society, what would prevent the return of segregation?

It was that Jim Crow laws, anti-miscegenation laws, etc., infringed the freedom of association of citizens governed by them. IOW, in \"my\" society, they wouldn't exist, whereas they could in yours being a limitation on free association for the purported good of the citizenry.\n\n&gt;But interestingly did happen countless times in eras without legal \n&gt;repercussion for discrimination.\n\nWhen and where?\n\n&gt;So you're just saying their success (or of the survivors at least) \n&gt;justifies the discrimination? Or what?\n\nAgain I thought it plain and nothing like what you took from it. I repeatedly said their success took place despite the ABSENCE of the laws you say are worthwhile. Not only were they not run out of town as you proposed would be a common occurrence, they prospered. In town after town, century after century, across the world. It's called a counter-example to your hypothesis. **What you claim will happen in the absence of laws that weren't passed until the 60's, historically did not happen.** The Jews did fine internationally right up until two governmental entities decided depriving them of the NEGATIVE rights was a good idea. Lack of community with people who hated them never appeared to be particularly hurtful to the Jewish community. They just went ahead and found useful, well paying jobs to learn and excel at. When the governments started messing with their negative rights to property, life and liberty, yeah things got ugly then.\n\n&gt;What counter example?\n\nJudaism for the 501st time.\n\n&gt;...except for all the ones that didn't.\n\nMeaning whom? Just asking to make sure that your answer is relevant to the topic at hand, how economic discrimination as permitted by an absence of 60's era civil rights laws is harmful. I'm sure you aren't thinking of some governmental program of extermination that is completely irrelevant to the topic at hand.\n\n&gt;The tangible differences I see in your society result in it being harder \n&gt;for me to get a job and easier for me to die. I don't like that.\n\nLife as an adult really is harder. Personal responsibility and decision-making is more difficult than delegating your autonomy to a 3rd party for sure. I think most children can attest to that fact.\n\nReally my only answer to this is that, long term, being an adult is more rewarding. Oh and that authoritarian governments inevitably, throughout human history, turn bad and the liberty ceded to the authority for security bites you in the ass and fails to produce either. That's not a particularly new observation, nor is it one that has any observed counter-examples of which I am aware.\n\nThe incipient bankruptcy of the European [not to mention the American] welfare state should be yet another case in point of the long term lack of feasibility of attempting to guarantee a limitless output of whatever, healthcare, retirement cash, etc., from the limited income generated by actual workers.", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Subsquid", "id": "t1_c9ompmz", "parent_id": "t1_c9ogngc", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431390470,

Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher.

Lack of community with people who hated them never appeared to be particularly hurtful to the Jewish community. They just went ahead and found useful, well paying jobs to learn and excel at.

No transfer payments. No Fed. Prices would drop for almost everything. Buying power would increase. Since they have the least money, the poor would see the most gain from this.\n\n- Elimination of all inter- and intrastate trade barriers. Drops in health care insurance as markets open up to interstate competition. Drops in energy costs as state mandated energy monopolies go away. Elimination of all national and state monopolies and cartels, again causing a general price decrease.\n\n- The elimination of gov't interference in economy would also eliminate the motive to corrupt officials.

Those with the highest socioeconomic status would enjoy them disproportionately, with marginalized minority groups at their mercy.  (I guess this is the idea?

The *first* thing I would do upon encountering a large group of people who were anti-me would be to get my family and me the hell away from them.\n\nThe people who've hated Jewish people have tended to hate them because among other things they are often hard workers, gravitate to jobs in demand and earn a lot of money even as they're being discriminated against. That's been the case for a looong time before the civil rights movement in the 60's. Jewish folks didn't have religious strictures against lending at interest; their relative freedom of contract led to material success; they tended to become doctors, lawyers and other skilled professional jobs with high earning potential and they did this for a long time before any laws tried to codify anti-discrimination.\n\nI'd prefer bigotry out in the open, to the hidden, de facto racism that you are powerless to stop anyway. At least then we'd have an open debate, rather than a bunch of embittered bigots going right on with their messed up epistemology but hidden beneath a veneer of compliance.

You can't stab a Jewish person because you hate them; that's morally impermissible in all cases, and illegal for centuries. Refusing to do business just let's them know who their enemies are. How much easier to put a face on bigotry and stigmatize it than if you publicized some fool refusing to serve X group?\n\nAnd yes, just like now in the status quo, the richest can pay for more material benefits.

Every protected trade was accompanied by \"Here's your change you statist fiend may you fry in egalitarian hell.\" How happy would you be to mutually benefit the townsfolk w/ the trade of the limited time of your life?

The point is moot.\n\nReally my objection to your thought here is that anti-discrimination laws through the agency of allowing gov't to deny freedom of association offer at best minor protection from the force of ostracism  a group could deploy against any minority. There's a big cost and a minor benefit, incredibly minor as it wouldn't change my behavior in the least.\n\nMore importantly, you completely dodged the fact that **without** anti-discimination laws, your fears about some community completely freezing out a given group have already proven ahistorical. Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher.

I'm saying reject them because they eliminate so little bigotry they aren't worth the cost.\n\n&gt;is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without \n&gt;fear of consequence.\n\nRunning amok is a ludicrous phrase here. Yes, it would be a wanton denial of association. A wild, blood bath of refusal of trade. And that crazed lunatic would still face the open censure of everyone who thought that mindset was stupid, and the implicit cost of loss of business. It's not like there's a lot of history here, about how people can prosper in hostile majority societies and boycotts can negatively impact bigoted businesses.\n\n&gt;As long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.\n\nNo, even a freed slave in the deep South would have seen a benefit from increased buying power, especially them actually.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Yup.

But I like your idea that if employers are free to discriminate this will somehow improve the economic status of those they discriminate against.\n\n&gt; I would have assumed the myriad of historical counter-examples to your claim would have led you to grasp maybe other factors are relevant to a discriminated minority's economic success than the hostility of the majority and lack of anti-discrimination law. But repeatedly throwing one in your face hasn't managed it yet!!!\n\nWhat historical counter-examples?  Where?\n\n&gt; Even in the Deep South, bus lines segregated. They didn't ban dark-skinned people from the bus or lunch counter; they just made it shitty - which they could still legally do now, if not quite as explicitly. If you can point to some widespread and total economic ostracism solved by anti-discrimination laws, point to it rather than exclaim about seriousness.\n\nI'm not sure what I'm missing here.  Why did segregation end (or become reduced), in your mind?\n\n&gt; Further, go ahead and explain why the historical experience of Judaic people in the US pre-60's and also worldwide isn't a total refutation of your claims.\n\nNo idea what you're talking about.\n\nThis is such a surreal conversation.  You're trying to sell me on the wonders of discrimination, when I don't want to discriminate.  Your society has *nothing* to offer me, other than ideology and the loss of rights I currently have and value.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1cxzw6", "selftext": "&gt;Look, if the elimination of segregation doesn't count as a significant\n&gt;reduction of discrimination in your book then we seem to have a \n&gt;irreconcilable disagreement.\n\nSegregation was a legal position imposed by Jim Crow laws.

Our irreconcilable disagreement seems to like in you persistently misconstruing my position. Anti-Jim Crow legislation would be a specific instance of eliminating infringements into freedom of association. IOW, point for freedom.\n\n&gt;Well no, in the absence of anti-discrimination laws they would just \n&gt;drive them out of the country altogether when they got the chance. \n\nWhich interestingly didn't happen in the century between the Civil War and the Civil Rights era. So what is the bright line for when this apocalypse of economic ostracism would occur sans the 60's Civil Rights era? A century wasn't enough.\n\n&gt;What historical counter-examples? Where?\n\nSo you really don't get it? Interesting. *What* would be the Jewish people I've mentioned about 500 times and their startling [at least for you] economic success **prior to anti-discrimination laws** and *where* would be basically worldwide. I mean you had Marx blathering on about \"The Jewish Question\" in the mid 1800's so it's really been a while now.\n\nSince they didn't get driven out of the countries where they lived for so long that, as a community they got wealthy producing bankers, doctors and lawyers, I am wondering where that leaves your theory about what will inevitably happen to minorities living in hostile majorities.\n\n&gt;I'm not sure what I'm missing here. Why did segregation end (or \n&gt;become reduced), in your mind?\n\nYou're missing at least 3 things I see.\n1) Jim Crow laws violated freedom of association\n2) Not even the Deep South produced economic ostracism just segregation.\n3) I have provided a counter-example to your theory that a lack of anti-discrimination laws will result in some type of ostracism driving the minority out of whatever locale.\n\n&gt;This is such a surreal conversation. You're trying to sell me on the \n&gt;wonders of discrimination,\n\nIt's surreal because you are making it surreal by persistent, and I would have thought intentional misunderstanding.\n\nI am trying to sell you on the wonders of freedom by pointing out your fears about what *might* happen if anti-discrimination laws didn't exist are unfounded and historically inaccurate. I mentioned two examples that leapt immediately to mind, the blacks of the deep South and Jews basically everywhere prior to the 1960's. The Jewish people in particular should be recognized by you as a startling counterpoint since as a people they endured such canards as drinking blood and killing Christ while becoming so materially successful they also became the target of conspiracy theories; somehow all managed without the wonderful benefits of your paternalism pretty much worldwide.\n\nIf personal freedom is *nothing* to you, then there's probably little else to discuss.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1cxzw6", "selftext": "&gt; Segregation was a legal position imposed by Jim Crow laws.

Let me ask: in your \n&gt;society, what would prevent the return of segregation? Or is it that \n&gt;increased segregation is acceptable or desirable to you?\n\nI thought it plain enough and not love for segregation. It was that Jim Crow laws, anti-miscegenation laws, etc., infringed the freedom of association of citizens governed by them. IOW, in \"my\" society, they wouldn't exist, whereas they could in yours being a limitation on free association for the purported good of the citizenry.\n\n&gt;But interestingly did happen countless times in eras without legal \n&gt;repercussion for discrimination.\n\nWhen and where?\n\n&gt;So you're just saying their success (or of the survivors at least) \n&gt;justifies the discrimination? Or what?\n\nAgain I thought it plain and nothing like what you took from it. I repeatedly said their success took place despite the ABSENCE of the laws you say are worthwhile. Not only were they not run out of town as you proposed would be a common occurrence, they prospered. In town after town, century after century, across the world. It's called a counter-example to your hypothesis. **What you claim will happen in the absence of laws that weren't passed until the 60's, historically did not happen.** The Jews did fine internationally right up until two governmental entities decided depriving them of the NEGATIVE rights was a good idea. Lack of community with people who hated them never appeared to be particularly hurtful to the Jewish community. They just went ahead and found useful, well paying jobs to learn and excel at. When the governments started messing with their negative rights to property, life and liberty, yeah things got ugly then.\n\n&gt;What counter example?\n\nJudaism for the 501st time.\n\n&gt;...except for all the ones that didn't.\n\nMeaning whom? Just asking to make sure that your answer is relevant to the topic at hand, how economic discrimination as permitted by an absence of 60's era civil rights laws is harmful. I'm sure you aren't thinking of some governmental program of extermination that is completely irrelevant to the topic at hand.\n\n&gt;The tangible differences I see in your society result in it being harder \n&gt;for me to get a job and easier for me to die. I don't like that.\n\nLife as an adult really is harder. Personal responsibility and decision-making is more difficult than delegating your autonomy to a 3rd party for sure. I think most children can attest to that fact.\n\nReally my only answer to this is that, long term, being an adult is more rewarding. Oh and that authoritarian governments inevitably, throughout human history, turn bad and the liberty ceded to the authority for security bites you in the ass and fails to produce either. That's not a particularly new observation, nor is it one that has any observed counter-examples of which I am aware.\n\nThe incipient bankruptcy of the European [not to mention the American] welfare state should be yet another case in point of the long term lack of feasibility of attempting to guarantee a limitless output of whatever, healthcare, retirement cash, etc., from the limited income

Anything short of that and the gov't is still has authority over you even if it presents no harm to anyone else.\n\n- No gov't intervention in trade; no import or export tariffs; prices drop and bureaucratic control [and cost] withers. No transfer payments. No Fed. Prices would drop for almost everything. Buying power would increase. Since they have the least money, the poor would see the most gain from this.\n\n- Elimination of all inter- and intrastate trade barriers. Drops in health care insurance as markets open up to interstate competition. Drops in energy costs as state mandated energy monopolies go away. Elimination of all national and state monopolies and cartels, again causing a general price decrease.\n\n- The elimination of gov't interference in economy would also eliminate the motive to corrupt officials. If you remove the money from their purview, there's no more point in dumping all that cash into bribes, political advertising, etc.\n\n- Unions lose ability to legally force unionization, but gain right to strike at will. NLRB goes away with attendant budget savings.\n\n- You'd be able to eat, smoke or drink anything you wanted; socially we'd save the cost of the war on drugs, associated imprisonment, related gang violence, etc.\n\n- You'd be able to freely interact with anyone you wanted, however you wanted, in any manner you wanted and to which you could get them to agree. Legalization of prostitution, nullification of sodomy laws, public decency laws, etc. Nullification of any law preventing gambling. No more cartel influence over state gambling licensing.\n\n- Gov't itself would shrink massively. All that money would go back into productive segments of the economy; all the money blown on compliance, regulation, administration, enforcement, etc. of interventionism and welfare statism would go away, further contributing to both price drops and national productivity.\n\nThat should be enough of a laundry list. All in all I've detailed trillions of dollars in savings, large gains in personal autonomy, decrease in crime rates, imprisonment and a massive overall increase in both personal buying power and national productivity that would result.

However, we can end the war on drugs without a return to rampant and open racism, sexism, etc. and the sacrifice of the basic human rights like healthcare that I have come to enjoy.  \n\nFurthermore, the \"benefits\" you describe would be conditional.  Those with the highest socioeconomic status would enjoy them disproportionately, with marginalized minority groups at their mercy.  (I guess this is the idea?

If you are envisioning group X being ostracized, why would group X want to live with, socialize with and benefit a community mostly composed of people who hated them and tried to marginalize them? People stratify right now to avoid that. The *first* thing I would do upon encountering a large group of people who were anti-me would be to get my family and me the hell away from them.\n\nThe people who've hated Jewish people have tended to hate them because among other things they are often hard workers, gravitate to jobs in demand and earn a lot of money even as they're being discriminated against. That's been the case for a looong time before the civil rights movement in the 60's. Jewish folks didn't have religious strictures against lending at interest; their relative freedom of contract led to material success; they tended to become doctors, lawyers and other skilled professional jobs with high earning potential and they did this for a long time before any laws tried to codify anti-discrimination.\n\nI'd prefer bigotry out in the open, to the hidden, de facto racism that you are powerless to stop anyway. At least then we'd have an open debate, rather than a bunch of embittered bigots going right on with their messed up epistemology but hidden beneath a veneer of compliance. In this tolerant paradise the 60's civil rights laws have created, 60 years later, people still gravitate to like ethnic communities and I still encounter overt, ugly racism, sexism, etc., on a daily basis. I can tell you for a FACT that if we'd spent 60 years teaching logic as a core curriculum to kids in public school, racism would be a bizarre memory.\n\nThe problem with racism isn't the behavior, it's the mindset that underlies it. You're obsessed with the symptoms of it, when by and large the nastiest symptoms are already outlawed. You can't stab a Jewish person because you hate them; that's morally impermissible in all cases, and illegal for centuries. Refusing to do business just let's them know who their enemies are. How much easier to put a face on bigotry and stigmatize it than if you publicized some fool refusing to serve X group?\n\nAnd yes, just like now in the status quo, the richest can pay for more material benefits.

And ideally the Jews would just leave in such a situation.\n\n&gt; In this tolerant paradise the 60's civil rights laws have created, 60 years later, people still gravitate to like ethnic communities and I still encounter overt, ugly racism, sexism, etc., on a daily basis\n\nSo what?  It's way better than it used to be.  Pay gaps are narrowing.  Minority groups can actually get jobs.\n\nAnd are you seriously reminding me that racism still exists?  **I know racism still exists.  I know anti-discrimination laws don't eliminate 100% of racism.** Stop appealing to the Nirvana fallacy, it isn't convincing.  If you want to make the argument that the laws don't work, then make it.

You move to a town, armed with your anti-discrim. laws, and discover that despite legal prohibitions from refusing you a job, trade, etc., 95% of the town thought you were bad for your love of anti-discrim. laws, excluded you from everything they legally could, and socially ostracized you. Every protected trade was accompanied by \"Here's your change you statist fiend may you fry in egalitarian hell.\" How happy would you be to mutually benefit the townsfolk w/ the trade of the limited time of your life? Like I said, my first move on encountering organized bigotry you fear, with or without the presence of anti-discrimination laws, would be to leave. \n\nSo my point is that the anti-discrimination laws provide no relevant benefit over the proposed change. The point is moot.\n\nReally my objection to your thought here is that anti-discrimination laws through the agency of allowing gov't to deny freedom of association offer at best minor protection from the force of ostracism  a group could deploy against any minority. There's a big cost and a minor benefit, incredibly minor as it wouldn't change my behavior in the least.\n\nMore importantly, you completely dodged the fact that **without** anti-discimination laws, your fears about some community completely freezing out a given group have already proven ahistorical. Jews are a great case study as they became hated for being on average economically successful compared to the hostile majority. They did it for hundreds of years prior and back in times when the Jewish community was being actively libeled by bigots for drinking the blood of newborns. This proves you don't need those anti-discriminatory laws at all to succeed economically in a hostile majority.\n\n&gt;I know racism still exists. I know anti-discrimination laws don't \n&gt;eliminate 100% of racism.\n\nMy point is that they eliminate relatively little racism, the economic  racism they do affect is still avoidable by a smart bigot and the costs of allowing gov't infringement into association is much higher. I'm not saying to reject AD laws because they don't eliminate all bigotry. I'm saying reject them because they eliminate so little bigotry they aren't worth the cost.\n\n&gt;is better than a racist who is allowed to run amok in society without \n&gt;fear of consequence.\n\nRunning amok is a ludicrous phrase here. Yes, it would be a wanton denial of association. A wild, blood bath of refusal of trade. And that crazed lunatic would still face the open censure of everyone who thought that mindset was stupid, and the implicit cost of loss of business. It's not like there's a lot of history here, about how people can prosper in hostile majority societies and boycotts can negatively impact bigoted businesses.\n\n&gt;As long as you're not part of the wrong minority group.\n\nNo, even a freed slave in the deep South would have seen a benefit from increased buying power, especially them actually.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; Yup.

Not only were they not run out of town as you proposed would be a common occurrence, they prospered. In town after town, century after century, across the world. It's called a counter-example to your hypothesis. **What you claim will happen in the absence of laws that weren't passed until the 60's, historically did not happen.** The Jews did fine internationally right up until two governmental entities decided depriving them of the NEGATIVE rights was a good idea. Lack of community with people who hated them never appeared to be particularly hurtful to the Jewish community. They just went ahead and found useful, well paying jobs to learn and excel at. When the governments started messing with their negative rights to property, life and liberty, yeah things got ugly then.\n\n&gt;What counter example?\n\nJudaism for the 501st time.\n\n&gt;...except for all the ones that didn't.\n\nMeaning whom? Just asking to make sure that your answer is relevant to the topic at hand, how economic discrimination as permitted by an absence of 60's era civil rights laws is harmful. I'm sure you aren't thinking of some governmental program of extermination that is completely irrelevant to the topic at hand.\n\n&gt;The tangible differences I see in your society result in it being harder \n&gt;for me to get a job and easier for me to die. I don't like that.\n\nLife as an adult really is harder. Personal responsibility and decision-making is more difficult than delegating your autonomy to a 3rd party for sure. I think most children can attest to that fact.\n\nReally my only answer to this is that, long term, being an adult is more rewarding. Oh and that authoritarian governments inevitably, throughout human history, turn bad and the liberty ceded to the authority for security bites you in the ass and fails to produce either. That's not a particularly new observation, nor is it one that has any observed counter-examples of which I am aware.\n\nThe incipient bankruptcy of the European [not to mention the American] welfare state should be yet another case in point of the long term lack of feasibility of attempting to guarantee a limitless output of whatever, healthcare, retirement cash, etc., from the limited income generated by actual workers.", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Subsquid", "id": "t1_c9ompmz", "parent_id": "t1_c9ogngc", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431390470,

Leave it all to the government. \n\nAll I am saying is don't get caught up in what people say and concentrate on what they do. [after taking all of his deductions, his tax effective tax rate was 11% in 2010](http://www.forbes.com/sites/janetnovack/2011/10/12/warren-buffets-effective-federal-income-tax-rate-is-just-11/) I have no problem with this. Everything he did was 100% legal and smart. What I do have a problem with is how he publicly says that he wants to pay more in taxes (to gain public support) then pays as little as possible. Stand by your words with actions, anything else is hypocritical.
