You then come up with a general idea for a solution. After that you hire a lobbyist who knows politicians that are preconditioned to be in support of your general bill and has the expertise in your industry and political expertise to know how to draft a bill that positively fixes the problems you are facing. Finally you send your lobbyist to explain the problem, a solution, and agree to help draft that solution working with the representatives who are not experts in your specific field.\n\nFor example: If you were a big oil company and you were having problems getting approval to drill in some areas or build a pipeline then you would hire a lobbyist that knows how the oil industry works, knows politicians that don't know how the oil industry works but wants to support them, and 3 knows how politics works when dealing with the EPA and the complex set of environmental laws we have in place. Even after all of this the only thing this will do is get your proposed solution on the floor to be voted on and isn't guaranteed to even pass. \n\n**So my question is this**, What do you want to lobby for that is even possible to lobby for using a lobbyist. Do you just have problems or do you have a solution you can hire the lobbyist to present? Are there enough representatives that have constituents who would large support your specific solution?

I would make it so the only way you can provide healthcare tax free is to provide unconditional funding through a tax advantaged account similar to an HSA. Instead of the company handing out $10k/year plan they will pay $10k into a tax free account that employees can use when buying health insurance on a market place system. The ACA right now is doing the opposite. They are actually strengthening the bond between being employed and having health insurance rather than weakening it. This severely hurts the effectiveness of the central market place improvement. **Edit:** I just wanted to add that I would make it so providing the HSA like plan would be required under my hypothetical ACA replacement but contributing to it wouldn't be. Employees that dont get contributions from their employer will be able to elect to have some money taken out of their paycheck like they can with 401ks.\n\n2. I would require that all pharmacies and hospitals advertise prices of medication, rooms, and other line items online. They must also advertise a non-binding average cost and other info like success and time of recovery for the procedures they offer. While this doesn't particularly help the people brought in for emergencies it will help out all the people who need to do necessary but planned treatment. That additional price competition will drive down the prices for ER services as well. \n\n3. I think we should tone back the restrictions on preexisting conditions to the high-risk pools with a cap % more they can charge for higher risk individuals. They still wont be able to deny claims but they can charge a little bit more which will prevent a raise in rates for healthy individuals while still making it a huge improvement on the Pre-ACA conditions for people with preexisting conditions. \n\n4. I don't have any concrete and specific implementations but we need to investigate the cause of the high physician and clinical services expenses and the cost of hospital care that together account for [52% percent of all of our spending](http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/business/health%20care%200.png)[[Source](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/03/10-ways-to-visualize-how-americans-spend-money-on-health-care/254736/)]. I imaging that some of that has to do with [how much we pay doctors](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/how-much-do-doctors-in-other-countries-make/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0) compared to other countries.\n\n5. I think we should bring back the pre-ACA catastrophic coverage only plans. According to [an editorial by David Belk, board certified in internal medicine,](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-belk/health-care-costs_b_4066552.html) many people who have insurance actually over pay for prescriptions that can actually cost less than their copays. By bringing back those plans combined with suggestions #1 and #2 will make it so some people can actually save money by selecting cheaper plans and paying for their prescriptions themselves. With the HSA like system they can even use the left over money to self insure for the higher co-pays and deductibles.

The trick is knowing how money works and realizing what \"luxuries\" you're considering necessities.\n\nI completely agree with you when it comes to the middle class. I was mostly trying to explain why we keep hearing about so many people doing so poorly for income reasons. Many of them are just over spending like the $250k household and misinterpreting it but there are also many people trying to scrape by on $15k/year minimum wage jobs that were once exclusive to 2nd income workers(stay at home moms with day jobs), college students, and teenagers. Now there are families who have 2 workers making that much and we are hearing a lot from them and the people who notice the problem. People are seeing that problem and then noticing that other people are having a hard time getting by like the overspenders in the middle class and they are combining them assuming income is the only problem. \n\nWe need to look at it as 2 major problems. The lower class got stuck in the sand and didn't get income increases like the middle and upper classes did during the economic boom. We also have a large number of people who overcommitted themselves spending wise and bought houses and cars they could only afford if everything went perfect with no reasonable safety net of their own. Now I'm not suggesting that the government jump in and bail them out and I'm not suggesting forced raises is the answer for the other problem but we do need to look at the problem as 2 separate real issues with how things currently are.

A teacher is a trusted authority figure, sure, but not nearly to the degree that a priest is. The teacher that inspires awe and deep trust in his pupils is pretty rare compared to the priest who does the same. The breach of trust is worse when a priest abuses it, because there's more trust to be betrayed.\n\nI also think this could be seen in patterns. Teachers meet lots of kids, but rarely develop deep connections that could potentially be abused. Priests meet fewer kids, but are supposed to have a deep connection with them (as with all their parishioners). Thus, to the kind of pedophile who deliberately seeks out positions of trust, being a priest is a lot more interesting than being a teacher - the kind of close relationship that could be abused would be unusual and potentially noticeable for teachers, but nothing out of the ordinary for a priest.

That's a poor argument. Federal aid to the poor is a joke anyway because it's constantly under attack by some members of Congress. And the business community doesn't particularly concern itself with poverty because it's not a profit driver. Of course there are PR stunts to \"show they care\", but they're nothing amazing. The US government should be more helpful for people with less privilege, but since both parties heavily represent the interests of elite citizens and persons, that doesn't happen. \n\nYou don't think there is a moral problem with punishing customers and workers when corporations are mandated by federal law to do certain things for their employees? I understand the loss of profit perfectly well, but that still doesn't affect most people, only the ones who have an investment stake in the company. It affects the net gain of wealth for mostly already wealthy people. The money very rarely\u2014and at low levels\u2014ever goes back into communities and for the public good. It's all privatized, which historically disenfranchises more people than not. Just look at what happened to labor unions through the 70s and 80s. When corporations are no longer beholden to their labor force, they aren't obligated to do jack shit. So we have  stagnating wages and poor conditions. I think it's especially important for people who work for corporations and aren't office professionals to have maternity laws passed and enforced. Most women and men in this country cannot afford to have a child and continue to work, or take unpaid time off to raise the child through infancy.

It's not unfounded to say that hate attacks happen, and that organized groups sometimes carry them out. The evidence is, for example, the news story I linked you. Better safe than sorry is exactly the same logic you are using, but reversed. It is better to be safe than sorry when it comes to protecting people from hate attacks vs. it is better to be safe than sorry when it comes to protecting people from civil liberties violations. So if it's silly then you are too. \n\nb. This logic is fine, but completely nonsensical in the context of the US. If the guiding line for the continuation of something is whether or not it can be universal, then there is almost nothing that is allowable in your government. Not every member of the public can be trusted with a firearm, therefore no firearms. Not every member of the public can be trusted with classified intelligence, therefore no classified information. \n\nFurther, if we want to talk about evidence, then provide me a link to even one gun shop or state that does this. And again, and where we're going to most disagree, I think it extremely unwise to make airport travel some sort of right that requires an extreme rationale to override it. \n\n2.\"I think these concerns are not unfounded. This watch list has the **potential** for great abuse...\" Again, let's have some evidence. Yes, the government will abuse people. The difference in my world versus yours is how addressable the concern is. If, in my world, the publication of the list leads to violence, then odds are good that either serious damage or death is the result. In your world, however, someone has to jump through a few extra hoops to get on an airplane. Further, while the IRS and DOJ issues are important, I'm not convinced that some terrible evil has happened. So some Tea Party groups didn't get 501(c)(3) status as quickly as they would've liked. It's not the end of America, and it certainly doesn't result in serious harm to anyone. The best argument you can make is that the delay in status made it more difficult to run their operation and therefore more difficult to advocate for their issues and therefore some generalized harm far in the future hasn't been avoided. That's not a convincing scenario for me.\n\nSo yes, you and I are going to disagree over the \"price\" we'll pay in terms of freedom v. security. We're also going to disagree about the amount of nefarious things that are going on behind the scenes. So unless you can prove this horrible, conspiratorial price to me (and vice-versa dependent on how we view burdens) I'm not going to be persuadable.\n\n3.We have no idea about the success of the list. I think you'll agree that's disquieting, but it's also a mystery rather than something you can hang your \"limited (if any) success\" hat on. Under our form of government the National Counterterrorism Center, authorized by Congress via the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, runs the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE), aka the terrorist watch list. They report to Congress, and so indirectly, are watched by the people. That's the way a republican government works. I think you may have inroads to a good argument for oversight changes, but I don't think your solution of transparency or civilian oversight is the right way to do it. There is absolutely a need to operate in the shadows. You think it's easier to catch a terrorist when they're unsure if they're being tracked, or if they know they are? Further, the publication of information might also tell you something about the source of the information. If I'm an al-Qaeda commander and I know my cell's been identified, and since it is a cell only a limited number of people have access to that information, you think I can't figure out who leaked the information? Bang, there goes the human intelligence source that could prevent future attacks. \n\n4.That's vigilantism plain and simple, which a civil society has no need for. If the government believes that the public can help, rather than, say, attacking random Muslims with the name Mohammed, then they publish the information. Before that point, all you do is start a witch hunt, and give cover to violent nutjobs. Remember, suspected terrorists are on there too. Think of how useful Reddit was with the Boston Marathon bombings. The mob did a bang-up job there.
