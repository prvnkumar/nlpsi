GOP Congressmen/women have no less of a mandate from their constituents and their constituents represent a significant portion of the USA.\n\n&gt;There is a growing anti-LGBT movement and a casual erosion of civil liberties and basic rights.\n\nActually, I think there is a growing PRO-LGBT movement.  Many members of the GOP have moved left on the issue of gay marriage.\n\n&gt;Whistleblowers are being hounded and imprisoned for revealing corruption under the guise of national security\n\nIf you are speaking of Manning, IMO he's guilty of treason.  There appears to be a growing chorus that tries to EXCUSE treason in his case.\n\n&gt;US and other citizens are being assasinated abroad with no trial, prisoners are being held without trial/tortured indefinitley with no evidence. These are all the actions of a facist/communist state \n\nI don't disagree with the first part...but the second part doesn't follow.  There's nothing inherent in communism in particular (by its definition) that would mean that assassinations/torture etc...must necessarily follow.  (And I'm not a fan of communism...but it's being used incorrectly here.)\n\n&gt; In the US it is now ok to dismiss someone as a liberal/republican as an answer to an argument rather than give a proper response.\n\nAgree.  This is too bad.\n\n&gt;I grew up with a terrorist threat, bombings and murders, randomn police/army stops disrupting my life on occasion but never experienced anything as degrading and unprofessional as the TSA. \n\nMe too.  But I have the opposite take.  It is because of growing up around terrorists threats that I do actually understand the TSA and what they are trying to accomplish in a virtually impossible environment where we all call on the government to keep us safe while simultaneously demanding they keep their hands off.\n\n&gt;There has not been a single exposed international terrorist threat against the US since 911 except for those instigated by the security forces on people they have groomed to do so. \n\nYou just entered tin foil hat territory.\n\n&gt;I was shocked to see how some sections of the government want to increase its military spending and reduce its educational spending yet anyone who questions the spending on the military is deemed a traitor.\n\nI don't know who is really calling for this.  Most people understand that as the wars wind down, we will reduce military spending.  As for education, I am sad that we are not getting the bang for our buck.  I think we are second only to Canada in what we spend per capita, but our results are frustratingly low.\n\n&gt;The fact that some counties want to push for creationism in schools and take money from science in a country taking graduates from around the world to fill those roles is insanely short sighted and detrimental to national security.\n\nI don't see anyone saying we should take money from science.  Au contraire. Don't mistake someone saying, \"I believe there is an Intelligent Creator of the universe\" as someone who is also saying, \"Y'all need to quit studyin' them thar sciences!\"\n\n&gt;If I was pro equality for all americans regardless of sexual orientation race or creed and anti gun control I do not have a political party.\n\nYou could talk to the Log Cabin Republicans?\n\n&gt;If I'm pro higher tax to spend on the military or to repair the failing infrastructure, I don't have a party. \n\nBut you are probably a Democrat.\n\n&gt;Apologies for unneccessary rant.\n\nNo apologies necessary.  I think that there are many people who are frustrated... but I am confident that we will work things out.  We have in the past and we will in the future.  It has been WORSE in the past than it is in the present.\n\nThe only thing we can do is remain informed and keep in contact with our elected officials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "t1_c8hgvjr", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "IBiteYou", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c8hfzr7", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1431333434, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8hgvjr", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361228815", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c8hcujf", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1431333019, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1361226287, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8hfzr7", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361226072", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c8hctu7", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431331537, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8hcujf", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361216837", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c8hcigc", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431331527, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8hctu7", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361216779", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c8hbsox", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431331322, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18rh9a", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8hcigc", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361215838", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}

This is not the behaviour of a democracy, this is entrapement and has been proven not to work in any country which has a legitimate terrorist threat.

It makes sense.\n\nIt's also farcically incorrect - while the author correctly applies the DW NOMINATE algorithm in a single instance, he only demonstrates it zeroed to a single year, which is not how the Keith Poole dataset is constructed.  The Poole dataset compares the adherence of politicians to a fixed slate of issues over time in their voting records, allowing one year to be compared to another.  If it were constructed as the RCP author constructs his 1938 dataset, that is, by coding the members relative to each other, it would show no deviation in its mean over time: it would be zeroed to maintain a constant average.\n\nImagine, for a moment, that I were to make a chart comparing the relative prices of Coke and Pepsi over time, and imagine further that the price of Pepsi was progressively increasing while the price of Coke was constant.  Now, I'm a somewhat green statistician out to demonstrate that the gap between the two is equally attributable to Coke decreasing in price relative to Pepsi as much as Pepsi is increasing in price relative to Coke.  (An absurd claim, clearly, but bear with me.)  To that end, I arrange my data points with n = year on the horizontal axis, and place the prices of Coke and Pepsi in a scatter plot on the y.  So far so good.  \"But,\" I say, \"this doesn't demonstrate the equal culpability of those scurrilous price-cutters in Atlanta!\"  In a flash of inspiration, I *average* the price of Coke and Pepsi for each n and transform my data, point by point, so that the divide between Coke and Pepsi is presented centered, on an arbitrary -1 to +1 scale.\n\nThe result is completely meaningless, of course, but it looks all science-y and stuff, and I can talk up the growing gap between Coke and Pepsi as a 'fact' out of context on the morning shows.  In case you haven't guessed by now, this is essentially what the RCP article does: it (incorrectly) claims that the correct way to apply DW NOMINATE is to redefine the issue parameters each year.  If you do that, you'll do a decent job of showing how far apart the parties are, but you're throwing out a lot of information on where they are relative to where they started.  \n\n&gt;WHAT percentage of academia is liberal again? Do you HONESTLY believe they are teaching in an unbiased fashion? They weren't when I was in college in the 90's.\n\nActually, given the prevalence of economists in the field, most public policy departments lean rather to the libertarian-right of the rest of their universities.  Of course, that would still look rather to the left from your perspective, but that's more an issue with the way your particular frame of reference has clouded your conception of the political \"center.\"  You know how the phrase \"cap and trade\" [elicits paroxysms of revulsion](https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=cap+and+trade+fox+news&amp;oq=cap+and+trade+fox+news&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) whenever it's mentioned on Fox News?  It may surprise you to learn that that sort of market-based approach has its origins on (what used to be) the American political *right* - HW Bush used it to great effect to curb NOx and SO2 emissions, and it still enjoys enormous popularity with the public at large.  That that wasn't enough to stop the Waxman-Markey Bill from being blocked by the GOP and conservative Blue-Dog Democrats should tell you all you need to know about where Congress stands relative to the political center.

The real question is whether the far-right will collapse as its base declines demographically before a credible leftist alternative to the Democratic party appears.  (The first is more likely, but it'll probably take a generation or two for its effects to become apparent.)\n\nReagan's landslide victory, meanwhile, was the product of a number of factors.  First and foremost, there was widespread dissatisfaction with the Carter administration.  Between Iran, the Oil Crisis, and the antics of his brother, there was plenty to make fun of.  Second, there was the anomalous character of the Carter ticket - a Democrat, from the Deep South.  In many ways, he was an anachronism; by that point the New Deal Coalition was already starting to fragment, and the Republican Southern Strategy was peeling more Southern Democrats off each year.  The DNC wasn't prepared, and they didn't yet have an effective response to this strategic shift, so a charismatic candidate like Reagan caught them flat-footed.    \n\nOverall: the NOMINATE scores don't lie.  As Congress becomes more polarized, that polarization is driven by right-wing politicians become more right-wing and left-wing politicians rubber-banding more slowly to occupy positions clustered around the opposite pivot.  (Read Krehbiel for more.)  The Democratic Party, meanwhile, has a demographic problem of its own.  Although it has strong leads among the young, the female, and the non-white, it still has some difficulty exploiting those.  Even if there were left-wing media operations with a similarly honed ability to get an emotional response and support for their positions as that of Fox News (and there isn't), it's just plain easier to dissuade a single mom working two part-time jobs from voting than it is to keep retirees away from the polls.  There's a difference both in motivation and in negative incentives to be dealt with.  Also, strong Republican performances in state-level redistricting allow them to multiply their influence in the House of Representatives.

It makes sense.\n\nIt's also farcically incorrect - while the author correctly applies the DW NOMINATE algorithm in a single instance, he only demonstrates it zeroed to a single year, which is not how the Keith Poole dataset is constructed.  The Poole dataset compares the adherence of politicians to a fixed slate of issues over time in their voting records, allowing one year to be compared to another.  If it were constructed as the RCP author constructs his 1938 dataset, that is, by coding the members relative to each other, it would show no deviation in its mean over time: it would be zeroed to maintain a constant average.\n\nImagine, for a moment, that I were to make a chart comparing the relative prices of Coke and Pepsi over time, and imagine further that the price of Pepsi was progressively increasing while the price of Coke was constant.  Now, I'm a somewhat green statistician out to demonstrate that the gap between the two is equally attributable to Coke decreasing in price relative to Pepsi as much as Pepsi is increasing in price relative to Coke.  (An absurd claim, clearly, but bear with me.)  To that end, I arrange my data points with n = year on the horizontal axis, and place the prices of Coke and Pepsi in a scatter plot on the y.  So far so good.  \"But,\" I say, \"this doesn't demonstrate the equal culpability of those scurrilous price-cutters in Atlanta!\"  In a flash of inspiration, I *average* the price of Coke and Pepsi for each n and transform my data, point by point, so that the divide between Coke and Pepsi is presented centered, on an arbitrary -1 to +1 scale.\n\nThe result is completely meaningless, of course, but it looks all science-y and stuff, and I can talk up the growing gap between Coke and Pepsi as a 'fact' out of context on the morning shows.  In case you haven't guessed by now, this is essentially what the RCP article does: it (incorrectly) claims that the correct way to apply DW NOMINATE is to redefine the issue parameters each year.  If you do that, you'll do a decent job of showing how far apart the parties are, but you're throwing out a lot of information on where they are relative to where they started.  \n\n&gt;WHAT percentage of academia is liberal again? Do you HONESTLY believe they are teaching in an unbiased fashion? They weren't when I was in college in the 90's.\n\nActually, given the prevalence of economists in the field, most public policy departments lean rather to the libertarian-right of the rest of their universities.  Of course, that would still look rather to the left from your perspective, but that's more an issue with the way your particular frame of reference has clouded your conception of the political \"center.\"  You know how the phrase \"cap and trade\" [elicits paroxysms of revulsion](https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=cap+and+trade+fox+news&amp;oq=cap+and+trade+fox+news&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) whenever it's mentioned on Fox News?  It may surprise you to learn that that sort of market-based approach has its origins on (what used to be) the American political *right* - HW Bush used it to great effect to curb NOx and SO2 emissions, and it still enjoys enormous popularity with the public at large.  That that wasn't enough to stop the Waxman-Markey Bill from being blocked by the GOP and conservative Blue-Dog Democrats should tell you all you need to know about where Congress stands relative to the political center.  Academics adopting positions out-of-step left of the Congressional mean does not constitute political bias.\n\nMore importantly, though, whatever one's personal political sentiments may be, professional practice in academia requires that you base your inquiries on a slate of experimentally and observationally supported premises (what you might, in layman's terms call \"facts\") and ensure that whatever conclusions you draw conform to an overall schema that we in the business like to call \"reality.\"  If you find that the academic conception of reality differs from your own, therefore, I would suggest that the best response might not be to raise a hue and cry, but rather to consider whether your own position is as firmly grounded.\n\n&gt;Explain to me the purpose of Rhode Island's voter ID laws, won't you?\n\nRhode Island is an unusual case, in that its voter ID laws were driven by African American, Democratic lawmakers.

The real question is whether the far-right will collapse as its base declines demographically before a credible leftist alternative to the Democratic party appears.  (The first is more likely, but it'll probably take a generation or two for its effects to become apparent.)\n\nReagan's landslide victory, meanwhile, was the product of a number of factors.  First and foremost, there was widespread dissatisfaction with the Carter administration.  Between Iran, the Oil Crisis, and the antics of his brother, there was plenty to make fun of.  Second, there was the anomalous character of the Carter ticket - a Democrat, from the Deep South.  In many ways, he was an anachronism; by that point the New Deal Coalition was already starting to fragment, and the Republican Southern Strategy was peeling more Southern Democrats off each year.  The DNC wasn't prepared, and they didn't yet have an effective response to this strategic shift, so a charismatic candidate like Reagan caught them flat-footed.    \n\nOverall: the NOMINATE scores don't lie.  As Congress becomes more polarized, that polarization is driven by right-wing politicians become more right-wing and left-wing politicians rubber-banding more slowly to occupy positions clustered around the opposite pivot.  (Read Krehbiel for more.)  The Democratic Party, meanwhile, has a demographic problem of its own.  Although it has strong leads among the young, the female, and the non-white, it still has some difficulty exploiting those.  Even if there were left-wing media operations with a similarly honed ability to get an emotional response and support for their positions as that of Fox News (and there isn't), it's just plain easier to dissuade a single mom working two part-time jobs from voting than it is to keep retirees away from the polls.  There's a difference both in motivation and in negative incentives to be dealt with.  Also, strong Republican performances in state-level redistricting allow them to multiply their influence in the House of Representatives.

It makes sense.\n\nIt's also farcically incorrect - while the author correctly applies the DW NOMINATE algorithm in a single instance, he only demonstrates it zeroed to a single year, which is not how the Keith Poole dataset is constructed.  The Poole dataset compares the adherence of politicians to a fixed slate of issues over time in their voting records, allowing one year to be compared to another.  If it were constructed as the RCP author constructs his 1938 dataset, that is, by coding the members relative to each other, it would show no deviation in its mean over time: it would be zeroed to maintain a constant average.\n\nImagine, for a moment, that I were to make a chart comparing the relative prices of Coke and Pepsi over time, and imagine further that the price of Pepsi was progressively increasing while the price of Coke was constant.  Now, I'm a somewhat green statistician out to demonstrate that the gap between the two is equally attributable to Coke decreasing in price relative to Pepsi as much as Pepsi is increasing in price relative to Coke.  (An absurd claim, clearly, but bear with me.)  To that end, I arrange my data points with n = year on the horizontal axis, and place the prices of Coke and Pepsi in a scatter plot on the y.  So far so good.  \"But,\" I say, \"this doesn't demonstrate the equal culpability of those scurrilous price-cutters in Atlanta!\"  In a flash of inspiration, I *average* the price of Coke and Pepsi for each n and transform my data, point by point, so that the divide between Coke and Pepsi is presented centered, on an arbitrary -1 to +1 scale.\n\nThe result is completely meaningless, of course, but it looks all science-y and stuff, and I can talk up the growing gap between Coke and Pepsi as a 'fact' out of context on the morning shows.  In case you haven't guessed by now, this is essentially what the RCP article does: it (incorrectly) claims that the correct way to apply DW NOMINATE is to redefine the issue parameters each year.  If you do that, you'll do a decent job of showing how far apart the parties are, but you're throwing out a lot of information on where they are relative to where they started.  \n\n&gt;WHAT percentage of academia is liberal again? Do you HONESTLY believe they are teaching in an unbiased fashion? They weren't when I was in college in the 90's.\n\nActually, given the prevalence of economists in the field, most public policy departments lean rather to the libertarian-right of the rest of their universities.  Of course, that would still look rather to the left from your perspective, but that's more an issue with the way your particular frame of reference has clouded your conception of the political \"center.\"  You know how the phrase \"cap and trade\" [elicits paroxysms of revulsion](https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=cap+and+trade+fox+news&amp;oq=cap+and+trade+fox+news&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) whenever it's mentioned on Fox News?  It may surprise you to learn that that sort of market-based approach has its origins on (what used to be) the American political *right* - HW Bush used it to great effect to curb NOx and SO2 emissions, and it still enjoys enormous popularity with the public at large.  That that wasn't enough to stop the Waxman-Markey Bill from being blocked by the GOP and conservative Blue-Dog Democrats should tell you all you need to know about where Congress stands relative to the political center.  Academics adopting positions out-of-step left of the Congressional mean does not constitute political bias.\n\nMore importantly, though, whatever one's personal political sentiments may be, professional practice in academia requires that you base your inquiries on a slate of experimentally and observationally supported premises (what you might, in layman's terms call \"facts\") and ensure that whatever conclusions you draw conform to an overall schema that we in the business like to call \"reality.\"  If you find that the academic conception of reality differs from your own, therefore, I would suggest that the best response might not be to raise a hue and cry, but rather to consider whether your own position is as firmly grounded.\n\n&gt;Explain to me the purpose of Rhode Island's voter ID laws, won't you?\n\nRhode Island is an unusual case, in that its voter ID laws were driven by African American, Democratic lawmakers.  Their reasons for doing so are unlike the reasons driving GOP voter ID efforts, being grounded very much in local politics - in particular a rather lurid moral panic about supposed Hispanic political fraudsters.

(After all, it's not like there's anybody else for a liberal to vote for.)  \n\nThat is, Democratic politicians *and* Republicans on the whole are more conservative than ever.  The real question is whether the far-right will collapse as its base declines demographically before a credible leftist alternative to the Democratic party appears.  (The first is more likely, but it'll probably take a generation or two for its effects to become apparent.)\n\nReagan's landslide victory, meanwhile, was the product of a number of factors.  First and foremost, there was widespread dissatisfaction with the Carter administration.  Between Iran, the Oil Crisis, and the antics of his brother, there was plenty to make fun of.  Second, there was the anomalous character of the Carter ticket - a Democrat, from the Deep South.  In many ways, he was an anachronism; by that point the New Deal Coalition was already starting to fragment, and the Republican Southern Strategy was peeling more Southern Democrats off each year.  The DNC wasn't prepared, and they didn't yet have an effective response to this strategic shift, so a charismatic candidate like Reagan caught them flat-footed.    \n\nOverall: the NOMINATE scores don't lie.  As Congress becomes more polarized, that polarization is driven by right-wing politicians become more right-wing and left-wing politicians rubber-banding more slowly to occupy positions clustered around the opposite pivot.  (Read Krehbiel for more.)  The Democratic Party, meanwhile, has a demographic problem of its own.  Although it has strong leads among the young, the female, and the non-white, it still has some difficulty exploiting those.  Even if there were left-wing media operations with a similarly honed ability to get an emotional response and support for their positions as that of Fox News (and there isn't), it's just plain easier to dissuade a single mom working two part-time jobs from voting than it is to keep retirees away from the polls.  There's a difference both in motivation and in negative incentives to be dealt with.  Also, strong Republican performances in state-level redistricting allow them to multiply their influence in the House of Representatives.

There are other factors, to be sure, but you just can't ignore the influence of such effective messaging.\n\nWinning Fox's approval is arguably as pressing a concern to Republican politicians today as winning their party's nomination is, and in any case it can contribute greatly to the latter - as we saw with Romney, Fox picked its candidate quite early in the primary cycle, helped reinforce the idea that he was the 'inevitable' choice, and stuck with him right through to November.  In return, he conformed his platform to Fox's message (even at the cost of contradicting his earlier position or positions) and favored appearances on Fox over appearances on other networks to a stunning degree.\n\nIf the 90s were the decade of Gingrich, the 2000s so far have been the age of Fox News.
