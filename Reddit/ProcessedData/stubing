I've repeatedly informed you that this same process is occurring today in many countries abroad. This is not just a historical example from America. In America however, the historical example does apply. The court system is still convoluted and drawn-out, class action cases can still take decades, companies STILL only are made to pay damages that amount to a fraction of what they've done, and companies still pay people off and avoid these cases at all costs.

I've found that when people purposefully identify themselves as socialists, they are making a stark distinction between that and liberalism. \n\nAnyway, the libertarian judicial system is not the same as the system we currently have. First, there would be less, simpler laws. We wouldn't need a thousand different laws that say \"don't fuck this guy over\". We'd have one law that said it. It also reduces and can eliminate many of the loop holes defense attorney's rely on now to win their case. Most of the time it's not that they proved their client didn't do something wrong, they just got away based on a technicality. That's an important factor that needs to be addressed. There's also a justified worry that a private citizen would never be able to afford to bring a law suit to a large company or corporation, and so the free market would just run wild. That's also addressed in a libertarian judicial system. Since one of the very few roles of government we believe in is protecting citizens from those who have caused them harm, the victim would be represented by the government. Like a public defender, but with the resources of the DoJ. This puts private citizens on par with big companies, putting one giant up against another. In the case of real, monetary damages, strong property rights will trump federal regulation every time.\n\nBut you mention a good point that not all pollution can be quantified by a monetary damage. The difference here is between compensation vs restitution. You sue the company that dumps garbage on your land for compensation for the actual monetary damage done. It covers your losses. But in the case of air pollution for example, where you might not have incurred a monetary injury, you would still sue for restitution. This is in place precisely to punish the offending polluter. They've committed an act of aggression against you by putting pollutants in the air you breathe against your will. Theft is still theft, whether its stealing a nickel or a $100. And aggression is still aggression whether they put bad shit in the air or break your leg. So pretend you're a company in the middle of a neighborhood pumping all sorts of nasty chemicals in the air. Every single person in that neighborhood has a claim against you, both for compensation and restitution, and their case is represented by the government. Every time you do this, they have a new claim against you. They continue to sue, they continue to win. Your prices skyrocket. Either you need to charge more, in which case you'll lose so many customers you go out of business, or you innovate your energy system so it doesn't cause the reason you're being sued. But you won't be able to maintain the model of polluting all you want and continuing to pay the victims without having to alter anything. It's completely unsustainable. \n\nLook, it's never going to happen. So debating this too much and too passionately is going to be a waste of time pretty soon. I happen to think that an entire population with the prosecution powers of the Department of Justice threatening to sue a polluter has a lot more teeth, than just implementing a fine if they pollute more than the law says they can. I think it hits them a lot harder where it hurts, and much more often. But yes, it largely depends on a huge change with our judicial system.

It's done in the name of safety (Patriot Act), the War on Drugs, or saving the children.  The current rounds of Anti-Abortion legislation (Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin) all have similar wording that will benefit the drug companies that provide drugs like the morning after pill.  Access is limited and costs go through the roof.  More government intervention... from Republicans who always talk of getting the government out of our lives.  Step by step the government tells you how to live your life.  Honestly, if you don't like abortion, just don't have one, and make sure young women have access to contraception, education, and employment opportunities.  Also, advocate for programs that eliminate the cycle of poverty.

Cuba was one of the leaders in terms of life expectancy, and the number of doctors per thousand of the population ranked above Britain, France and Holland. In Latin America it ranked in third place after Uruguay and Argentina.[10] There remained marked inequalities however. Most of Cuba's doctors were based in the relatively prosperous cities and regional towns, and conditions in rural areas, notably Oriente, were significantly worse.[11] Only 8% of the rural population had access to healthcare.[12] The mortality rate was the third lowest in the world.[13] According to the World Health Organization, the island had the lowest infant mortality rate of Latin America.[13]", "id": "t1_c9spnrd", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "kinderdemon", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1cas2m", "id": "t1_c9spnzj", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "WikipediaLinkFixer", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c9spnrd", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431319920, "controversiality": 0, "body": "[Healthcare in Cuba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Cuba)\n\n*^designed ^to ^help ^make ^wikipedia ^links ^more ^readable*", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9spnzj", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1367738885", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c9f56mc", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431319923, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1cas2m", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9spnrd", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1367738851", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "stubing", "id": "t1_c9f56mc", "parent_id": "t1_c9f546m", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431558561, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1cas2m", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9f56mc", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1365971350", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "kinderdemon", "id": "t1_c9f546m", "parent_id": "t1_c9ezum3", "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1431558593, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9f546m", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1365971150", "distinguished": null, "ups": 4}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1cas2m", "id": "t1_c9t9dem", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Quarkism", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c9ezum3", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431288680, "controversiality": 0, "body": "How does government subsidies in insurance effect big pharma?

Under those frameworks, the court will do more of an inquiry, along the same lines that you are inquiring. Even so, there still may be a sufficient difference. I'm not sure how many straight marriages result in children, though I'd guess it's around 60%. There's also the fact that a homosexual couple will never unintentionally have a child. Marriage, in part, was set up to make sure that there was an established partnership in the case of unexpected pregnancies, at least back in the day when sex was (supposedly) reserved for marriage. I'm not sure how much weight that carries now that extra-marital sex is the norm, but there still might be something there. \n\nIn the end, you have to remember that it's not the court's job to make sure the laws are intelligent, just that they are valid under the constitution. The kind of scrutiny your giving the law is traditionally reserved for the legislature, not the court, though sometimes it seems like having 9 intelligent justices babysit congress (and all the state legislatures) wouldn't be such a bad idea.
