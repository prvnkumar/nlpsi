{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;  I think it\u2019s funny that the 80/20 rule works for wealth distribution\u2026 and natural phenomena\u2026 (Just read on Wikipedia). \n\nYeah ... zipf's law. And the small-world network people and the chaos people will tell you that 1/f distributions ('scale free') are a sign of self-organization. Order out of chaos. Which means *that* income distribution may well be a natural phenomena in a complex dynamic network system (the economy) as much as a stable ecosystem made of of populations of evolved creatures.\n\n&gt; On the topic of Wall street funding main street, in regards to hedge funds you won\u2019t believe. 100 plus million will be tied up in an investment for years\u2026. and how many people work in the back office? Usually 5-10. Maybe 20 if its billion plus firm \n\nWell, there are certainly outsized portfolios and returns per-person working at the fund. I agree with that. And the LPs are \"locked up\" for a while. I agree. The fund itself may move in and out of different positions more rapidly, though. Each \"hedge fund\" (which has over time become a fairly vague term) has a \"schtick\" or a \"trick\", an investment thesis, via which they generate their \"how we make our returns that beat the market\" story. Whatever. Do they help provide liquidity to the market at large? Maybe. I don't know. Does better market liquidity help main street? Maybe. I don't know. I can't argue for or against the modern form of hedge funds because I really don't know anything about them any more. They've changed too much since I did know something, and I haven't kept up. \n\nMy worry about main-street as intersects 'wall-street' is two-fold: Depository Financial Institutions (Consumer and merchant banks with checking and savings accounts) should not be able to use that DDA aggregate to collateralize market bets. Glass-stegal kind of got rid of that. Under Clinton (yes, with a Republican congress) we got rid of this for some reason. I don't know why we got rid of it, but it doesn't seem to have been positive. So, that's One. Number two is that when banks (these depository account asset banks) *should* be making their money doing \"loans\" to main-street. Yes, in current times they need to be careful (due-diligence). I get that. They aren't VC. But with essentially 0% interest rates, why would they lend *any* money. They essentially don't. Which is a problem for all of us ... because savings and loans is what they are supposed to do!\n\n&gt; It\u2019s true the rich may thrive on American wealth but let\u2019s not get too cozy about it. Our economic situation is not going to improve unless we do something about it.\n\nAgreed. So the question is to define the problem. What is one of the problems? Unemployment. Why? Labor not needed. Why? No (global) demand for American built products and services, at the price America can make/deliver them. Right? \n\nTell evil capitalists to hire more? To do what? There's no demand for American-built products. Why not? Expensive. Raise minimum wage? That makes it worse -- products more expensive. \"The rich should fix it\" -- well, they *do* fix their problem ... by exporting labor requirements to China and robots. Still leaves us with unemployment.\n\nSo, to solve unemployment, we need more demand for products/services. OK, --give-- everyone a job, those people will have demand? Well, sure -- they'll demand cheap products from China. American employer's will go bankrupt (no customers) and we are ... right back here.\n\nThen, what do we do about it? Well, let's break this down: why isn't America competitive with it's ability to build inexpensive consumer products? (Ignoring the fact that we are -- America is the largest manufacturing country in the world; we just don't need that many people to do it...)\n\nHint1: There is an answer to this core problem, if you break it down to its core elements.\n\nHint2: Having the government mandate prosperity has never in the history of the world ever worked.\n\nWe can chat about this later.

Just resubmerging myself into the fun world of reddit!\n\n&gt;Which means that income distribution may well be a natural phenomena in a complex dynamic network system (the economy) as much as a stable ecosystem made of populations of evolved creatures.&lt;\n\nI think your likely to be very right. I think any new economic situation needs to account for some economic diversity. Interestingly 80/20 rule may be an ultimate goal? Where 20% may be more wealthy than the 80% but both should have a *better* quality of life. (Is this how this works?)\n\nHere is what I find a problem with the current buying and selling of corporate stock. Corporate sock is..... largely no longer a means to build capital to improve the company's product, its become a currency and the only expectation is to get some sort of quick ROI of 20% (that's HUGE). \n\nSmaller companies fear going public because of there is a lack of diversification for controlling interests, the company  loses their autonomy and is subject to the whims of their shareholders. I think there would be a lot of supporting evidence that the current corporate structure hurts small businesses. (I think this sort of research will be important in support for a new entity structure. Specifically to prove that technological advancements cannot easily come to fruition because seed capital must be obtained privately not publicly...I'll come back to this point)\n\nIn this economy I am under the assumption that \n\n1) There is a lack of jobs:\n\nCompanies (as previously discussed) have squeezed two jobs into one and have been increasingly pushing for productivity.\n\n2) American products are needed, we just have to change the products:\n\nThere are technological advancements every day! We could be building hover boards (heh)! But do we allow for new small business to really thrive. Is these products too expensive to build. &lt;---- and this is where I think the real problem is. The cost of todays goods are just too costly. You would need large sums of capital, but there's a problem.... banks are not loaning. Plus going public means losing autonomy of your business. \n\n&gt;Then, what do we do about it? Well, let's break this down: why isn't America competitive with it's ability to build inexpensive consumer products? (Ignoring the fact that we are -- America is the largest manufacturing country in the world; we just don't need that many people to do it...)&lt;\n\nYes this is key! I think its very important to do an analysis of why the costs of goods are rising. *If and it is what I suspect it is* It's the demand for ROI. I will have to do further research.  (But its the pressure that stock only increases if there is growth of net profit year after year.. which I've state before since NP is on a bell curve this is a huge problem. And therefore the price will artificially inflate)\n\nIf I have explained myself well, I'm going to bring this full circle\n\nIf the Top 1% wanted to simulate into a new 80/20 model wouldn't they just have to directly contribute capital to these small businesses? And it looks to me they have a lot of capital to contribute. Take their corporate stocks away and give these 1%ters a new investment opportunity. \"Investors Fees\" \n\nSo here is the unknown:\n\nDo you think it's possible if we dissolved corporate stocks and in turn asked the 1% to invest in these investors fees- Would capital flow more freely? Let's stop trading stocks like a currency and actually create new capital.\n\nSide Note:\nYes, because glass-steagall act's clock ran out ... and because of Alan Greenspan's human optimism, there went the housing crash.  Alan Greenspan turned a blind eye to the interest only loans knowing that they would default largely because of his confidence that banks wouldn't take any actions that would allow for the banks to collapse.

They've changed too much since I did know something, and I haven't kept up. \n\nMy worry about main-street as intersects 'wall-street' is two-fold: Depository Financial Institutions (Consumer and merchant banks with checking and savings accounts) should not be able to use that DDA aggregate to collateralize market bets. Glass-stegal kind of got rid of that. Under Clinton (yes, with a Republican congress) we got rid of this for some reason. I don't know why we got rid of it, but it doesn't seem to have been positive. So, that's One. Number two is that when banks (these depository account asset banks) *should* be making their money doing \"loans\" to main-street. Yes, in current times they need to be careful (due-diligence). I get that. They aren't VC. But with essentially 0% interest rates, why would they lend *any* money. They essentially don't. Which is a problem for all of us ... because savings and loans is what they are supposed to do!\n\n&gt; It\u2019s true the rich may thrive on American wealth but let\u2019s not get too cozy about it. Our economic situation is not going to improve unless we do something about it.\n\nAgreed. So the question is to define the problem. What is one of the problems? Unemployment. Why? Labor not needed. Why? No (global) demand for American built products and services, at the price America can make/deliver them. Right? \n\nTell evil capitalists to hire more? To do what? There's no demand for American-built products. Why not? Expensive. Raise minimum wage? That makes it worse -- products more expensive. \"The rich should fix it\" -- well, they *do* fix their problem ... by exporting labor requirements to China and robots. Still leaves us with unemployment.\n\nSo, to solve unemployment, we need more demand for products/services. OK, --give-- everyone a job, those people will have demand? Well, sure -- they'll demand cheap products from China. American employer's will go bankrupt (no customers) and we are ... right back here.\n\nThen, what do we do about it? Well, let's break this down: why isn't America competitive with it's ability to build inexpensive consumer products? (Ignoring the fact that we are -- America is the largest manufacturing country in the world; we just don't need that many people to do it...)\n\nHint1: There is an answer to this core problem, if you break it down to its core elements.\n\nHint2: Having the government mandate prosperity has never in the history of the world ever worked.\n\nWe can chat about this later.

I think any new economic situation needs to account for some economic diversity. Interestingly 80/20 rule may be an ultimate goal? Where 20% may be more wealthy than the 80% but both should have a *better* quality of life. (Is this how this works?)\n\nHere is what I find a problem with the current buying and selling of corporate stock. Corporate sock is..... largely no longer a means to build capital to improve the company's product, its become a currency and the only expectation is to get some sort of quick ROI of 20% (that's HUGE). \n\nSmaller companies fear going public because of there is a lack of diversification for controlling interests, the company  loses their autonomy and is subject to the whims of their shareholders. I think there would be a lot of supporting evidence that the current corporate structure hurts small businesses. (I think this sort of research will be important in support for a new entity structure. Specifically to prove that technological advancements cannot easily come to fruition because seed capital must be obtained privately not publicly...I'll come back to this point)\n\nIn this economy I am under the assumption that \n\n1) There is a lack of jobs:\n\nCompanies (as previously discussed) have squeezed two jobs into one and have been increasingly pushing for productivity.\n\n2) American products are needed, we just have to change the products:\n\nThere are technological advancements every day! We could be building hover boards (heh)! But do we allow for new small business to really thrive. Is these products too expensive to build. &lt;---- and this is where I think the real problem is. The cost of todays goods are just too costly. You would need large sums of capital, but there's a problem.... banks are not loaning. Plus going public means losing autonomy of your business. \n\n&gt;Then, what do we do about it? Well, let's break this down: why isn't America competitive with it's ability to build inexpensive consumer products? (Ignoring the fact that we are -- America is the largest manufacturing country in the world; we just don't need that many people to do it...)&lt;\n\nYes this is key! I think its very important to do an analysis of why the costs of goods are rising. *If and it is what I suspect it is* It's the demand for ROI. I will have to do further research.  (But its the pressure that stock only increases if there is growth of net profit year after year.. which I've state before since NP is on a bell curve this is a huge problem. And therefore the price will artificially inflate)\n\nIf I have explained myself well, I'm going to bring this full circle\n\nIf the Top 1% wanted to simulate into a new 80/20 model wouldn't they just have to directly contribute capital to these small businesses? And it looks to me they have a lot of capital to contribute. Take their corporate stocks away and give these 1%ters a new investment opportunity. \"Investors Fees\" \n\nSo here is the unknown:\n\nDo you think it's possible if we dissolved corporate stocks and in turn asked the 1% to invest in these investors fees- Would capital flow more freely? Let's stop trading stocks like a currency and actually create new capital.\n\nSide Note:\nYes, because glass-steagall act's clock ran out ... and because of Alan Greenspan's human optimism, there went the housing crash.  Alan Greenspan turned a blind eye to the interest only loans knowing that they would default largely because of his confidence that banks wouldn't take any actions that would allow for the banks to collapse.

Sorry...\n\nThere is something in agent-based game-theoretic simulations that yield what they call evolutionarily stable strategies. To use one of the simple examples, there are a bunch of agents, each of them will have a strategy (which vary across the population) and they will meet each other and play a game of (say) prisoner's dilemma. Depending on their respective success, they reproduce or die. The population will then grow or shrink. And there will be (often) a couple of strategies that emerge in the population to be dominant. Maybe 1/3 of strategy A and 2/3 of strategy B.\n\nIf you end up with 100% of strategy A or 100% of strategy B, often the populations will shrink and die off.\n\nThere are different models, but the designers of the simulations are trying to see if (and how) altruism (for example) can evolve.\n\nIt's interesting to me studying different places (I have lived in the US, in eastern-europe, in Japan and visited over 3 dozen countries over the years) ... is that it is possible for everyone to be equally poor. It doesn't seem to be possible for everyone to be equally rich. But what is also interesting is that where there is income disparity, yes, there are winners and losers.

They've changed too much since I did know something, and I haven't kept up. \n\nMy worry about main-street as intersects 'wall-street' is two-fold: Depository Financial Institutions (Consumer and merchant banks with checking and savings accounts) should not be able to use that DDA aggregate to collateralize market bets. Glass-stegal kind of got rid of that. Under Clinton (yes, with a Republican congress) we got rid of this for some reason. I don't know why we got rid of it, but it doesn't seem to have been positive. So, that's One. Number two is that when banks (these depository account asset banks) *should* be making their money doing \"loans\" to main-street. Yes, in current times they need to be careful (due-diligence). I get that. They aren't VC. But with essentially 0% interest rates, why would they lend *any* money. They essentially don't. Which is a problem for all of us ... because savings and loans is what they are supposed to do!\n\n&gt; It\u2019s true the rich may thrive on American wealth but let\u2019s not get too cozy about it. Our economic situation is not going to improve unless we do something about it.\n\nAgreed. So the question is to define the problem. What is one of the problems? Unemployment. Why? Labor not needed. Why? No (global) demand for American built products and services, at the price America can make/deliver them. Right? \n\nTell evil capitalists to hire more? To do what? There's no demand for American-built products. Why not? Expensive. Raise minimum wage? That makes it worse -- products more expensive. \"The rich should fix it\" -- well, they *do* fix their problem ... by exporting labor requirements to China and robots. Still leaves us with unemployment.\n\nSo, to solve unemployment, we need more demand for products/services. OK, --give-- everyone a job, those people will have demand? Well, sure -- they'll demand cheap products from China. American employer's will go bankrupt (no customers) and we are ... right back here.\n\nThen, what do we do about it? Well, let's break this down: why isn't America competitive with it's ability to build inexpensive consumer products? (Ignoring the fact that we are -- America is the largest manufacturing country in the world; we just don't need that many people to do it...)\n\nHint1: There is an answer to this core problem, if you break it down to its core elements.\n\nHint2: Having the government mandate prosperity has never in the history of the world ever worked.\n\nWe can chat about this later.

I think any new economic situation needs to account for some economic diversity. Interestingly 80/20 rule may be an ultimate goal? Where 20% may be more wealthy than the 80% but both should have a *better* quality of life. (Is this how this works?)\n\nHere is what I find a problem with the current buying and selling of corporate stock. Corporate sock is..... largely no longer a means to build capital to improve the company's product, its become a currency and the only expectation is to get some sort of quick ROI of 20% (that's HUGE). \n\nSmaller companies fear going public because of there is a lack of diversification for controlling interests, the company  loses their autonomy and is subject to the whims of their shareholders. I think there would be a lot of supporting evidence that the current corporate structure hurts small businesses. (I think this sort of research will be important in support for a new entity structure. Specifically to prove that technological advancements cannot easily come to fruition because seed capital must be obtained privately not publicly...I'll come back to this point)\n\nIn this economy I am under the assumption that \n\n1) There is a lack of jobs:\n\nCompanies (as previously discussed) have squeezed two jobs into one and have been increasingly pushing for productivity.\n\n2) American products are needed, we just have to change the products:\n\nThere are technological advancements every day! We could be building hover boards (heh)! But do we allow for new small business to really thrive. Is these products too expensive to build. &lt;---- and this is where I think the real problem is. The cost of todays goods are just too costly. You would need large sums of capital, but there's a problem.... banks are not loaning. Plus going public means losing autonomy of your business. \n\n&gt;Then, what do we do about it? Well, let's break this down: why isn't America competitive with it's ability to build inexpensive consumer products? (Ignoring the fact that we are -- America is the largest manufacturing country in the world; we just don't need that many people to do it...)&lt;\n\nYes this is key! I think its very important to do an analysis of why the costs of goods are rising. *If and it is what I suspect it is* It's the demand for ROI. I will have to do further research.  (But its the pressure that stock only increases if there is growth of net profit year after year.. which I've state before since NP is on a bell curve this is a huge problem. And therefore the price will artificially inflate)\n\nIf I have explained myself well, I'm going to bring this full circle\n\nIf the Top 1% wanted to simulate into a new 80/20 model wouldn't they just have to directly contribute capital to these small businesses? And it looks to me they have a lot of capital to contribute. Take their corporate stocks away and give these 1%ters a new investment opportunity. \"Investors Fees\" \n\nSo here is the unknown:\n\nDo you think it's possible if we dissolved corporate stocks and in turn asked the 1% to invest in these investors fees- Would capital flow more freely? Let's stop trading stocks like a currency and actually create new capital.\n\nSide Note:\nYes, because glass-steagall act's clock ran out ... and because of Alan Greenspan's human optimism, there went the housing crash.  Alan Greenspan turned a blind eye to the interest only loans knowing that they would default largely because of his confidence that banks wouldn't take any actions that would allow for the banks to collapse. He assumed banks would not intentionally hurt their own business....then we learned the terms \"too big to fail\". Sadly we all put faith in \"experts\" but really, experts are only good guessers. \n\nIt's great talking to you too! I think I may like to peruse this idea further and write a more detailed report.

And, to level-set this conversation, I was trying to understand (hence the questions) as opposed to proposing anything myself or debating you.\n\nThat last one, I might start doing (a very little) here by throwing up some alternative factoids or perspectives. And then, maybe we can get into what it would take to \"sell\" someone on the idea. Recognizing from the outset that you can't sell it to everyone in the ecosystem because any systemic shift from the status-quo will have winners and losers.\n\n&gt; Does Wall Street have to be so volatile\n\nWho knows? Even off Wall-street with have things like the Bitcoin exchanges. I'm guessing that you are talking about the publicly traded equity markets? If so, is the volatility or hype around things like Facebook or Twitter IPOs or Apple the fault of Wall-street or marketing hype and lemmings?\n\n&gt; But will is continue to work in the best interest of the people? \n\nYou seem to break this into three parts: Wall-street volatility, technological innovation coupled with corporatism (lobbyists pushing for regulations that limit competition and populism destroying strength of the corporation) and the wealth gap.\n\nFor the first, I'll let my last question stand.\n\nFor the second, I would take a longer lens. When Carnegie was building rail-roads, the water-ways people pushed back *hard* on that nonsense. It failed to ultimately succeed because of west-of-the-great-lakes we don't have options thing, and because of the Rockefeller thing but it was a real thing for over 30-40 years. Rockefeller: government broke him up. 20 years later, *each* of the baby-standards were larger than the original at the time of the break-up. IBM: by the time the government got around to curtailing them, technology had kind of \"gotten\" them. AT&amp;T: same thing. Microsoft: same thing. Government response to monopoly power is slow and reactive. In an evolving tech landscape, the new-new thing will kill the old-old guy ... even if they try to stop it. They can't.\n\nIs innovation dead? Don't know, but I see lots of nifty stuff I don't remember from 20 years ago (cheaply, at least): high-speed internet, wireless internet, (cheap) cell phones, GPS, Siri on iPhones, $200 laptops, DVRs, Netflix, ... there are more in industrial and less-consumer spaces like minimills for steel production and MRI machines. 3D printing. High density FPGAs (download your own open-source circuits!). Desktop genomics. mRNA arrays.\n\nI'm not seeing it. I see corporatism as pure corruption ... and not new. I see technological innovation as being alive and well. Volatility? Is it Wall-streets fault or the lemmings fault?\n\nAnd, wealth-gap ... I'm not seeing it. Maybe you make $100K/year. Or maybe you make $100B/year. If you don't make that $100B through corruption by selling me something that makes my life easier/better (like MS Office) for $100. My productivity improves 500% for $100? Sign-me up. I make more money. You earned my $100. And the simple fact that you have $100B doesn't really affect me. If it did, that is simple old-fashioned envy (or class-envy, which is usually populism) and not worthy of adult consideration.\n\nSo, I see poor people with cars, air-conditioning, laptops, high-speed internet, smart-phones and two flat-screen TVs, and I am reminded of words from my old Ethiopian cab driver: He wanted to come to America and see a country where poor people are fat.\n\nSo, I get your enthusiasm and wanting to solve \"big\" problems. I admire and applaud that. But ... I guess I'm having a tough time seeing the problem here.\n\nIf I were to \"attack\" a real-world problem (this is me), it probably would have to do something with unemployment, expensive health-care delivery, keeping the air clean BY finding clean ways to deliver electricity cheaply NOT by fools-errand mandated solutions (like Solar), higher-ed bubble: It is ridiculous that people graduate with $100K in debt for a degree in Hispanic-Transgendered studies and no ability to get a job. Any job. What is everyone thinking!?! That shit needs to stop.\n\nAnyway, that may have edged over into being preachy. Sorry.

Companies are so large they have reached their max market share. Therefore in order for profits to not stagnate they have to reduce operating costs. This eventually means reducing the costs of wages. This squeezes two jobs into one. The new entity structure alleviates this because via taken direct labor and operating costs out of the equation, it also allows for returns for investors even when profits are stagnate. \n\n(I'm going to break into a rant. In what effing world would investments become unprofitable when there is a steady stream of profits (with no growth) Eff you wall street ! The way stocks work is against all logic! Good thing this can be repaired)\n\n2) Healthcare.\n\tHealthcare is a beast. Most drug companies and medical equip companies are private. And Health insurance companies are partnerships (wait\u2026 wait i don't know this for sure I'm just guessing from memory. And someone could school me on this statement). That would have to be dealt with by other laws and regulations. the only thing the new entity structure resolves is that corps wont want to cut these expenses. They may want to increase them. Why? less net profit equals less taxes. We could improve this through tax regulations though. \n\n3) Cleaner air Aka how can new technologies survive: \nYes I have a separate solution for how patents should be treated. So now i'll give you the details. Currently if your a patent holder you own a company that creates a product. And your the ONLY company that creates that product. Unless you sell your patent. Well Eff That! Lets change this. \n\nHeres the new solution:\nYour create a patent. You go through the govt and get that patent on the system (remember its public). Here's what happens next: Multiple companies likes your patent and want to build your product. All of these multiple companies gives you a \"Patent Fee.\" The fee is calc'ed as follows  (Revenues - inventory costs)/inventory costs * (revenues - inventory costs) * x%. Just like a founders fee.  Multiple companies will create a product at their own set price and the invisible hand of supply and demand and capitalism begins. Competition ensues, capitalism thrives and thrives even BETTER! \n\n4) Education is way too overpriced:\nHopefully taking the the stress out of operating costs will aid companies to pay more benefits to its workers, such as paid education and helping with student loans. The problem is educational institutions are currently non-profits. *This is important* This reduces my arguments potency because this new entity structure would act much like non-profits and we can look to non-profits like educational institutions to see what the results of this new organization may just be like. However Non-profits to do not give fees to investors so maybe this would calm the fever for wealth but this is speculation. Non profits are about legacy, meaning your name on the business inst. building. This is not something I would except my new entity to have a problem with. But who knows? I believe this is an weakness the needs to be addressed.\n\nWhats very interesting to me now is not only do i have to convince someone that the idea is good idea,  I may have to sway their heart about the current state of capitalism. I may have to give them reason to think that current corporate entity structure could be improved so more groups of people could succeed.

A lot to think through and about. Made you busy typing on a Sunday! Sorry...\n\nThere is something in agent-based game-theoretic simulations that yield what they call evolutionarily stable strategies. To use one of the simple examples, there are a bunch of agents, each of them will have a strategy (which vary across the population) and they will meet each other and play a game of (say) prisoner's dilemma. Depending on their respective success, they reproduce or die. The population will then grow or shrink. And there will be (often) a couple of strategies that emerge in the population to be dominant. Maybe 1/3 of strategy A and 2/3 of strategy B.\n\nIf you end up with 100% of strategy A or 100% of strategy B, often the populations will shrink and die off.\n\nThere are different models, but the designers of the simulations are trying to see if (and how) altruism (for example) can evolve.\n\nIt's interesting to me studying different places (I have lived in the US, in eastern-europe, in Japan and visited over 3 dozen countries over the years) ... is that it is possible for everyone to be equally poor. It doesn't seem to be possible for everyone to be equally rich. But what is also interesting is that where there is income disparity, yes, there are winners and losers. But in *many* of the countries where it is possible to become rich through innovation or technical entrepreneurship (instead of pure feudal inheritance or friends-of-the-family corruption), when the \"pie\" gets bigger, the rich *do* get richer. But so do the poor. \n\nSo it comes down to a question of whether we want to all be equally poor, or allow some super-rich to emerge (like Bill Gates) because he enriches all of us ... and where the \"rich\" pay 70% of the income taxes in the US ... and enable the poor to be safer.

And you end up with individuals creating firms (creation), growth, stagnation, decline, death as outcomes of the ecosystem of competing firms made up out of individuals.\n\n &gt; so many poor and few rich is because rich carries \n\nNot necessarily the reason, but it goes together. Both for income, savings, return on investment, entrepreneurial activity and effectiveness-of-any-human-action, you end up with a Pareto-like distribution. The 80/20 rule it is called in English. After an Italian economist/mathmetician a long time ago that noticed that regardless of the system, 20% of the people had 80% of the money (and vice-versa). This has been generalized by theorists and even a practitioner named Koch (no relation to the brothers, worked at BCG as an analyst and then an entrepreneural turn-around guy) that: 80% of results come from 20% of activities. Now, we can't predict from this theory *which* people will win or lose, but we can predict across time and space that this distribution is largely true.\n\n&gt; power because wealthier people have more access to information, access to consumer goods, access to technological advancements. \n\nWell, in that case, the poor in America and here on Reddit must be some of the most powerful people in the world!\n\n&gt; the poor were educated enough to come together and revolt\n\nWell, even the uneducated poor have revolted white violently in places like Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Korea and China. I don't know much about Europe, but I'm assuming that France and Russia were much the same?\n\nPeople who are angry enough to revolt are emotional. Emotional people are stupid and easily led by a charismatic leader. A leader who feeds that emotion to build his army. Once the leader has used them to 'win', he kills them. Useful idiots. Or dangerous competition. Either way: unnecessary after the revolution.\n\n&gt; Wall street's trickle down effect isn't working. \n\nWell, I don't think it is Wall-street's trickle down. But look at it this way: The rich don't put their money in mattresses or bury it in the back yard or put it in a big swimming pool like Scrooge McDuck. They either spend it (new car, pool, yacht, house, wife) or invest it (savings, low-yield/low-risk debt, higher(?)-yield/higher-risk equities, exotic trades and hedges, their own enterprise (LBO, etc.) or give it away (Ford Foundation, Bill&amp;Melinda Gates, Billionaire's pledge). Which of those does not directly or indirectly create jobs or help the poor?\n\nPut another way: If America isn't working out the way it is supposed to, the rich are fucked because they have no place to invest their money. For even selfish reasons. Even real-estate value assumes that there are other rich people out there. So the rich kind of need America to work -- even if it is only so that they can become more rich.\n\n", "id": "t1_cdxdngt", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "zArtLaffer", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdxqv0q", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sputnikbunny", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;  I think it\u2019s funny that the 80/20 rule works for wealth distribution\u2026 and natural phenomena\u2026 (Just read on Wikipedia). \n\nYeah ... zipf's law.

Which means *that* income distribution may well be a natural phenomena in a complex dynamic network system (the economy) as much as a stable ecosystem made of of populations of evolved creatures.\n\n&gt; On the topic of Wall street funding main street, in regards to hedge funds you won\u2019t believe. 100 plus million will be tied up in an investment for years\u2026. and how many people work in the back office? Usually 5-10. Maybe 20 if its billion plus firm \n\nWell, there are certainly outsized portfolios and returns per-person working at the fund. I agree with that. And the LPs are \"locked up\" for a while. I agree. The fund itself may move in and out of different positions more rapidly, though. Each \"hedge fund\" (which has over time become a fairly vague term) has a \"schtick\" or a \"trick\", an investment thesis, via which they generate their \"how we make our returns that beat the market\" story. Whatever. Do they help provide liquidity to the market at large? Maybe. I don't know. Does better market liquidity help main street? Maybe. I don't know. I can't argue for or against the modern form of hedge funds because I really don't know anything about them any more. They've changed too much since I did know something, and I haven't kept up. \n\nMy worry about main-street as intersects 'wall-street' is two-fold: Depository Financial Institutions (Consumer and merchant banks with checking and savings accounts) should not be able to use that DDA aggregate to collateralize market bets. Glass-stegal kind of got rid of that. Under Clinton (yes, with a Republican congress) we got rid of this for some reason. I don't know why we got rid of it, but it doesn't seem to have been positive. So, that's One. Number two is that when banks (these depository account asset banks) *should* be making their money doing \"loans\" to main-street. Yes, in current times they need to be careful (due-diligence). I get that. They aren't VC. But with essentially 0% interest rates, why would they lend *any* money. They essentially don't. Which is a problem for all of us ... because savings and loans is what they are supposed to do!\n\n&gt; It\u2019s true the rich may thrive on American wealth but let\u2019s not get too cozy about it. Our economic situation is not going to improve unless we do something about it.\n\nAgreed. So the question is to define the problem. What is one of the problems? Unemployment. Why? Labor not needed. Why? No (global) demand for American built products and services, at the price America can make/deliver them. Right? \n\nTell evil capitalists to hire more? To do what? There's no demand for American-built products. Why not? Expensive. Raise minimum wage? That makes it worse -- products more expensive. \"The rich should fix it\" -- well, they *do* fix their problem ... by exporting labor requirements to China and robots. Still leaves us with unemployment.\n\nSo, to solve unemployment, we need more demand for products/services. OK, --give-- everyone a job, those people will have demand? Well, sure -- they'll demand cheap products from China. American employer's will go bankrupt (no customers) and we are ... right back here.\n\nThen, what do we do about it? Well, let's break this down: why isn't America competitive with it's ability to build inexpensive consumer products? (Ignoring the fact that we are -- America is the largest manufacturing country in the world; we just don't need that many people to do it...)\n\nHint1: There is an answer to this core problem, if you break it down to its core elements.\n\nHint2: Having the government mandate prosperity has never in the history of the world ever worked.\n\nWe can chat about this later.

I think any new economic situation needs to account for some economic diversity. Interestingly 80/20 rule may be an ultimate goal? Where 20% may be more wealthy than the 80% but both should have a *better* quality of life. (Is this how this works?)\n\nHere is what I find a problem with the current buying and selling of corporate stock. Corporate sock is..... largely no longer a means to build capital to improve the company's product, its become a currency and the only expectation is to get some sort of quick ROI of 20% (that's HUGE). \n\nSmaller companies fear going public because of there is a lack of diversification for controlling interests, the company  loses their autonomy and is subject to the whims of their shareholders. I think there would be a lot of supporting evidence that the current corporate structure hurts small businesses. (I think this sort of research will be important in support for a new entity structure. Specifically to prove that technological advancements cannot easily come to fruition because seed capital must be obtained privately not publicly...I'll come back to this point)\n\nIn this economy I am under the assumption that \n\n1) There is a lack of jobs:\n\nCompanies (as previously discussed) have squeezed two jobs into one and have been increasingly pushing for productivity.\n\n2) American products are needed, we just have to change the products:\n\nThere are technological advancements every day! We could be building hover boards (heh)! But do we allow for new small business to really thrive. Is these products too expensive to build. &lt;---- and this is where I think the real problem is. The cost of todays goods are just too costly. You would need large sums of capital, but there's a problem.... banks are not loaning. Plus going public means losing autonomy of your business. \n\n&gt;Then, what do we do about it? Well, let's break this down: why isn't America competitive with it's ability to build inexpensive consumer products? (Ignoring the fact that we are -- America is the largest manufacturing country in the world; we just don't need that many people to do it...)&lt;\n\nYes this is key! I think its very important to do an analysis of why the costs of goods are rising. *If and it is what I suspect it is* It's the demand for ROI. I will have to do further research.  (But its the pressure that stock only increases if there is growth of net profit year after year.. which I've state before since NP is on a bell curve this is a huge problem. And therefore the price will artificially inflate)\n\nIf I have explained myself well, I'm going to bring this full circle\n\nIf the Top 1% wanted to simulate into a new 80/20 model wouldn't they just have to directly contribute capital to these small businesses? And it looks to me they have a lot of capital to contribute. Take their corporate stocks away and give these 1%ters a new investment opportunity. \"Investors Fees\" \n\nSo here is the unknown:\n\nDo you think it's possible if we dissolved corporate stocks and in turn asked the 1% to invest in these investors fees- Would capital flow more freely? Let's stop trading stocks like a currency and actually create new capital.\n\nSide Note:\nYes, because glass-steagall act's clock ran out ... and because of Alan Greenspan's human optimism, there went the housing crash.  Alan Greenspan turned a blind eye to the interest only loans knowing that they would default largely because of his confidence that banks wouldn't take any actions that would allow for the banks to collapse. He assumed banks would not intentionally hurt their own business....then we learned the terms \"too big to fail\". Sadly we all put faith in \"experts\" but really, experts are only good guessers. \n\nIt's great talking to you too! I think I may like to peruse this idea further and write a more detailed report.

Sorry!\n\nYes, this only attacks publicly traded stocks put on the market. All publicly traded stocks are byproducts of corporations. These include IPOs. And since the full plan is to transition ALL CORPS to this new structure, publicly traded stocks would be extinct.\n\n There are other forms of publicly traded equity. These would be publicly traded private equity funds (\"PEFs\"). These are Partnerships that combine LP interests in various other partnerships. Investors in PEFs will receive performance fees based on hurdle rates and income for the lower tiered partnerships. Essentially this falls under the same SEC rules as hedge funds.  What I like about PEF's (and I'm willing to leave these alone) is that they are not trading partnership interests daily or even hourly. Why? SEC Laws already state you need to have wealth of $1 million plus to be an investor. That is because investing is so risky. Good returns on PEF's take years of 5-10. So that would be a long term investment. The other benefits of PEFs is that SEC is very specific about how these funds are trading and are overseeing these very well in my opinion.  Note these SEC regulations do not come into play when you just buy a share of stock in a corporation.  Plus today if you want to be a little guy and invest in PEF you would have to buy publicly traded shares of a corp that invests in PEFs\u2026 well corps would be erased in this plan. So there goes that and PEF's after axing corps would still be under the SEC rules. Truth be told if you have the wealth to invest in PEFs, sure you can make great returns but you can also fail miserably! So I say let the rich keep taking these risks\u2026. it's like specialized gambling in my opinion, from my experience most don't do well. Its just a long term game of craps. \n\nOkay so here are opposing argument to your response. I'm going to boil these down. Hopefully I have fully grasp what your saying.\n\n1) Technological advancements cannot be stopped\u2026. and at the end of the day they will become successful.  And specifically we're talking advancements that change the status quo.\n\nA. Ah but we are only looking at success stories. There is a very full possibility that corps can swallow up good ideas. This is done  first when a person creates a patent. The creator of this patent probably has one of two choices. The can receive seed money from investors. Or they can sell their patent to the highest bidder. Unfortunately if the highest bidder is one of the largest corps in the world how could any amount of seed money compete? There is also speculation that these corps could instill fear, by threatening lawsuits which may make the uneducated submit to a patent sale. Its speculation but it certainly happens. Ack! I really don't want to get into specifics examples on a sunday. lol. \n\n2) Motivation could change everything\n\nA Yes. But this motivated person would have to have two qualities and be a lucky contender (if the situation above happened). For one they would have to be intelligent enough to create a patent. Secondly they would have to shun corporate money and take the lessor seed money. They may decide this for fame or creative control. But what if they just wanted to be rich? What if they were not philosophers and are just byproducts of out shitty college education system that focuses on learning trades and not expanding minds to such crazy things as philosophy. (kay so my hobby is philosophy and we philosophers got a lot of problems with today's world). Thirdly they would have to find seed money! Easier said than done! \u2026. Are we going to wait for this chanve to be fulfilled until we can get some decent technological innovation the opposes the status quo? Why not just facilitate the system so these technological advancements can happen a lot easier. \n\n3) What happens to the prices of our products??  Hey, we all like products, they allow us to be more profitable.\n\nThis idea works with capitalism. Yup, the only thing thats being changed is how you  culminate investors and please \"founders\". All the economic laws of capitalism still apply.\n\n4) Wealth gap? What wealth gap? (this may be a sideline topic to this discussion but I love talking about this!) \n\nWell the wealth gap is more clear for me to see for one simple reason. I'm at the high end of the wealth gap but my parents are at the bottom end. Mom works 50 plus hours and dad is full time worker who has a very physical job. He's getting older and each day the job is harder and harder for him to do. They always were at the min wage level so they only got enough $ together to buy a modest condo in their late 40s. And that is because they became blindsided about the growing cost of living. As a result they have to put in a lot of blood and sweat but don't have much to show for it (understandably this is relative but i believe advance civilizations should bring quality of life up\u2026 not create more of a struggle against the successful top)\n\nSo it's not class envy for me\u2026 this will be the hardest thing to explain but let me try. It's years of reading philosophy and translating it to not just sentiments but mathematics. (and I'm not lying this took years of learning!) But I will boil it down to how i went from a business mind to a belief in a sort of caring that should be extended to every human being.\n\nInherently our social structure today has very strong ideas that a person must 1) work hard to get to the top 2) a person is in the hands of their own destiny 3) unsuccessful persons is due to laziness or a sort of darwinian result of our nature.\n\nPhilosophy argues:\n\n1) the inherent structure of this system (that is capitalism) forces failure:\nheres the long a short of it wrapped in a neat metaphor.. and i just thought of this metaphor so here we go (lol!): You want plants in your garden to grow. You have one garden where you nourish the plants with enriched soil and the second garden you just throw seeds on the ground and see what happens. Throwing seeds in the ground does not give nearly as good results. Actually the tossed seeds do terribly. The tossed seeds translates to the poorer kids. #1 the education system in the citys they live in is shoty, #2 kids in poorer families have to deal with physical and mental anxieties such as inadequate food, abuse and lack of parental guidance since both parents must work. #3 Since these kids feel like they cannot be apart of society they become apart of something else; gangs, which leeds to crime.\n\nSo\u2026.kids in enriched soil, these are the kids living in towns with their is  wealth. Towns revenue increases from property taxes  and those towns can provide a better education. Also kids of the Middle class/wealthy come from fewer broken homes. Ect. and we'll move on\u2026 I think thats enough.\n\n2) The system only allows people with skills that can be used on the job to flourish, while others are forced to struggle:\n\nWhy should we allow some people to fail. Do they deserve to fail because of our darwinian structure? Many people can easily say \"sure\" there will be failures. But lets go here: We have a unconditional request of one another.  You may not feel it because we are so closed off from each individual person but it exists. We all request love, help, acceptance and even respect from one another. When we improve society so we can be more moral and accepting of one another we become happier people. Not only do you benefit from the good feelings but others benefit.

This is simple enough to understand.\n\nOK, name-calling aside (you commie!) ... I'm always (myself) going back to a clear definition of the problem. What are we trying to fix? Here, it seems that you have some vague feeling(s) that:\n\n  - Founders have too much equity, but need something \"fair\"\n\n  - CEOs and founders may not be the same. And CEOs are paid too much today\n\n  - Workers aren't paid enough, and this isn't fair\n\n  - Wall-street is rapacious and equity markets in particular need to be dismantled/destroyed\n\nI'm assuming that you are in the US if you are afraid to be labeled a \"commie\". Your proposal is intended to:\n\n  - Incentivize the founder \"fairly\"\n\n  - More \"pie\" for the workers\n\n  - Somehow (haven't seen how) minimize executive pay\n\n  - Kill Wall-street because they suck (or something)\n\n  - More room for regulations in this structure. (I'm not seeing \"how\" on this part; and not knowing \"what\" kind of regulation you are trying to create room for ... no comment)\n\nI'm sorry if I keep missing the thread or back-tracking -- maybe it's the industries that I've been exposed to. In my world, it kind of goes like this:\n\n  - Founder and a couple of co-founders or friends work out a provisional bplan, financial model, pitch-deck and prototype (or at least demo) and maybe get a couple of LOIs from potential customer-types\n  - Customers get a killer-deal if they fund development of V1 just for them. Other-wise, angels+vc\n  - Build product. Sell product. Fix product. Sell some more.\n  - Need more dudes to expand in Asia ... more VC. Scale product.\n  - More VC. More dudes. More scale. More products? \n  - Mezzanine --&gt; M&amp;A. OR\n  - Go public. (This was more common pre-Sarbanes-Oxeley) \n\nNow, there may be some futzing around with factories and suppliers and vendors here if you are making physical equipment (like Cisco). More approval cycles if you've got FDA approval (Insulin pumps). More debt capitalization if \"capital intensive\" (CapEx) ... like a regional telecom. More EPA stuff if you are building a new kind of 100MW electricity generator. But, grossly speaking, the same idea.\n\nIn this world, things already kind of work (from my point of view). I see angels+VCs+iBankers helping capitalize start-up and then growth companies. I see stock-options giving success-fees to *all* employees. I see the founder getting diluted by angel+vc and IPO or M&amp;A (or both), but not the employees. If the thing dies, everyone loses all of the time-imagination-energy that went into it. If the thing takes off, everyone wins.\n\nWhere is this so broken that we need to fix it?\n\nAre you really trying to fix just Walmart and McDonald's and the like?\n\nIf so, do you want to change the rules/environment for everyone, or just Walmart and Wall-street? If you are not trying to throw out the baby with the bathwater, how do you preserve the good parts of the system while \"punishing\" the bad men? Is it easier to do a one-size-fits-all for everyone and *hope* that a benevolent government run by people with the right-color shirts help until the team changes at half-time?\n\n", "id": "t1_cdvdav0", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "zArtLaffer", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "id": "t1_cdw7lsg", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sputnikbunny", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "selftext": "Thanks for your detailed work-through on the financials.

And then, maybe we can get into what it would take to \"sell\" someone on the idea. Recognizing from the outset that you can't sell it to everyone in the ecosystem because any systemic shift from the status-quo will have winners and losers.\n\n&gt; Does Wall Street have to be so volatile\n\nWho knows? Even off Wall-street with have things like the Bitcoin exchanges. I'm guessing that you are talking about the publicly traded equity markets? If so, is the volatility or hype around things like Facebook or Twitter IPOs or Apple the fault of Wall-street or marketing hype and lemmings?\n\n&gt; But will is continue to work in the best interest of the people? \n\nYou seem to break this into three parts: Wall-street volatility, technological innovation coupled with corporatism (lobbyists pushing for regulations that limit competition and populism destroying strength of the corporation) and the wealth gap.\n\nFor the first, I'll let my last question stand.\n\nFor the second, I would take a longer lens. When Carnegie was building rail-roads, the water-ways people pushed back *hard* on that nonsense. It failed to ultimately succeed because of west-of-the-great-lakes we don't have options thing, and because of the Rockefeller thing but it was a real thing for over 30-40 years. Rockefeller: government broke him up. 20 years later, *each* of the baby-standards were larger than the original at the time of the break-up. IBM: by the time the government got around to curtailing them, technology had kind of \"gotten\" them. AT&amp;T: same thing. Microsoft: same thing. Government response to monopoly power is slow and reactive. In an evolving tech landscape, the new-new thing will kill the old-old guy ... even if they try to stop it. They can't.\n\nIs innovation dead? Don't know, but I see lots of nifty stuff I don't remember from 20 years ago (cheaply, at least): high-speed internet, wireless internet, (cheap) cell phones, GPS, Siri on iPhones, $200 laptops, DVRs, Netflix, ... there are more in industrial and less-consumer spaces like minimills for steel production and MRI machines. 3D printing. High density FPGAs (download your own open-source circuits!). Desktop genomics. mRNA arrays.\n\nI'm not seeing it. I see corporatism as pure corruption ... and not new. I see technological innovation as being alive and well. Volatility? Is it Wall-streets fault or the lemmings fault?\n\nAnd, wealth-gap ... I'm not seeing it. Maybe you make $100K/year. Or maybe you make $100B/year. If you don't make that $100B through corruption by selling me something that makes my life easier/better (like MS Office) for $100. My productivity improves 500% for $100? Sign-me up. I make more money. You earned my $100. And the simple fact that you have $100B doesn't really affect me. If it did, that is simple old-fashioned envy (or class-envy, which is usually populism) and not worthy of adult consideration.\n\nSo, I see poor people with cars, air-conditioning, laptops, high-speed internet, smart-phones and two flat-screen TVs, and I am reminded of words from my old Ethiopian cab driver: He wanted to come to America and see a country where poor people are fat.\n\nSo, I get your enthusiasm and wanting to solve \"big\" problems. I admire and applaud that. But ... I guess I'm having a tough time seeing the problem here.\n\nIf I were to \"attack\" a real-world problem (this is me), it probably would have to do something with unemployment, expensive health-care delivery, keeping the air clean BY finding clean ways to deliver electricity cheaply NOT by fools-errand mandated solutions (like Solar), higher-ed bubble: It is ridiculous that people graduate with $100K in debt for a degree in Hispanic-Transgendered studies and no ability to get a job. Any job. What is everyone thinking!?! That shit needs to stop.\n\nAnyway, that may have edged over into being preachy. Sorry. You probably ought to focus on the question part of this post! :-)\n\nLater, after I have noodled through cost/benefit of a structural change a bit, we can brain out a way to \"sell\" enough eco-system participants to get the sea-change you are looking for.\n\n", "id": "t1_cdw8cfe", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "zArtLaffer", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdwt461", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sputnikbunny", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdwt4zk", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sputnikbunny", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cdwt461", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428337840, "controversiality": 0, "body": "So the problems (and I very much agree) we should address\n\n1) unemployment\n\n2) healthcare \n\n3) cleaner air (so thats improving technology)\n\n4) education is waaaay over priced\n\nI also have to divulge into the cost/benefit of this new entity plan but i think this will be wrapped up in these explinations\n\n1) How to increase unemployment with this new entity structure:\n\tJobs have currently been under pressure. Companies are so large they have reached their max market share. Therefore in order for profits to not stagnate they have to reduce operating costs. This eventually means reducing the costs of wages. This squeezes two jobs into one. The new entity structure alleviates this because via taken direct labor and operating costs out of the equation, it also allows for returns for investors even when profits are stagnate. \n\n(I'm going to break into a rant. In what effing world would investments become unprofitable when there is a steady stream of profits (with no growth) Eff you wall street ! The way stocks work is against all logic! Good thing this can be repaired)\n\n2) Healthcare.\n\tHealthcare is a beast. Most drug companies and medical equip companies are private. And Health insurance companies are partnerships (wait\u2026 wait i don't know this for sure I'm just guessing from memory. And someone could school me on this statement). That would have to be dealt with by other laws and regulations. the only thing the new entity structure resolves is that corps wont want to cut these expenses. They may want to increase them. Why? less net profit equals less taxes. We could improve this through tax regulations though. \n\n3) Cleaner air Aka how can new technologies survive: \nYes I have a separate solution for how patents should be treated. So now i'll give you the details. Currently if your a patent holder you own a company that creates a product. And your the ONLY company that creates that product. Unless you sell your patent. Well Eff That! Lets change this. \n\nHeres the new solution:\nYour create a patent. You go through the govt and get that patent on the system (remember its public). Here's what happens next: Multiple companies likes your patent and want to build your product. All of these multiple companies gives you a \"Patent Fee.\" The fee is calc'ed as follows  (Revenues - inventory costs)/inventory costs * (revenues - inventory costs) * x%. Just like a founders fee.  Multiple companies will create a product at their own set price and the invisible hand of supply and demand and capitalism begins. Competition ensues, capitalism thrives and thrives even BETTER! \n\n4) Education is way too overpriced:\nHopefully taking the the stress out of operating costs will aid companies to pay more benefits to its workers, such as paid education and helping with student loans. The problem is educational institutions are currently non-profits. *This is important* This reduces my arguments potency because this new entity structure would act much like non-profits and we can look to non-profits like educational institutions to see what the results of this new organization may just be like. However Non-profits to do not give fees to investors so maybe this would calm the fever for wealth but this is speculation. Non profits are about legacy, meaning your name on the business inst. building. This is not something I would except my new entity to have a problem with. But who knows? I believe this is an weakness the needs to be addressed.\n\nWhats very interesting to me now is not only do i have to convince someone that the idea is good idea,  I may have to sway their heart about the current state of capitalism. I may have to give them reason to think that current corporate entity structure could be improved so more groups of people could succeed. Do you agree? \n\nWhat you think thus far :-)\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdwt4zk", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386534731", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Hmmm. A lot to think through and about. Made you busy typing on a Sunday! Sorry...\n\nThere is something in agent-based game-theoretic simulations that yield what they call evolutionarily stable strategies. To use one of the simple examples, there are a bunch of agents, each of them will have a strategy (which vary across the population) and they will meet each other and play a game of (say) prisoner's dilemma. Depending on their respective success, they reproduce or die. The population will then grow or shrink. And there will be (often) a couple of strategies that emerge in the population to be dominant. Maybe 1/3 of strategy A and 2/3 of strategy B.\n\nIf you end up with 100% of strategy A or 100% of strategy B, often the populations will shrink and die off.\n\nThere are different models, but the designers of the simulations are trying to see if (and how) altruism (for example) can evolve.\n\nIt's interesting to me studying different places (I have lived in the US, in eastern-europe, in Japan and visited over 3 dozen countries over the years) ... is that it is possible for everyone to be equally poor. It doesn't seem to be possible for everyone to be equally rich. But what is also interesting is that where there is income disparity, yes, there are winners and losers. But in *many* of the countries where it is possible to become rich through innovation or technical entrepreneurship (instead of pure feudal inheritance or friends-of-the-family corruption), when the \"pie\" gets bigger, the rich *do* get richer. But so do the poor. \n\nSo it comes down to a question of whether we want to all be equally poor, or allow some super-rich to emerge (like Bill Gates) because he enriches all of us ... and where the \"rich\" pay 70% of the income taxes in the US ... and enable the poor to be safer. Not because it is unfair, but because super-wealth enables us to be able to help our brother in that system?\n\n", "id": "t1_cdwu210", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "zArtLaffer", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "id": "t1_cdx3a70", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sputnikbunny", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "selftext": "&gt; I wonder if in this agent based model ideally we would want a mix so the majority would be a upper middle class. If A is rich, and B is poor we'd like a majority to be a mix of both AB. A mix were AB has a healthy amount of A and smaller amount of B? \n\nWell, the simulations that I am referring to have each individual have their own strategy. And then populations of strategies will emerge with different ratios. What is interesting to me is that a blended strategy system will end up with a systemic better total outcome. I used this in my side agent-based computational economics research, and you can do things like creating a \"computational theory of the firm\". And you end up with individuals creating firms (creation), growth, stagnation, decline, death as outcomes of the ecosystem of competing firms made up out of individuals.\n\n &gt; so many poor and few rich is because rich carries \n\nNot necessarily the reason, but it goes together. Both for income, savings, return on investment, entrepreneurial activity and effectiveness-of-any-human-action, you end up with a Pareto-like distribution. The 80/20 rule it is called in English. After an Italian economist/mathmetician a long time ago that noticed that regardless of the system, 20% of the people had 80% of the money (and vice-versa). This has been generalized by theorists and even a practitioner named Koch (no relation to the brothers, worked at BCG as an analyst and then an entrepreneural turn-around guy) that: 80% of results come from 20% of activities. Now, we can't predict from this theory *which* people will win or lose, but we can predict across time and space that this distribution is largely true.\n\n&gt; power because wealthier people have more access to information, access to consumer goods, access to technological advancements. \n\nWell, in that case, the poor in America and here on Reddit must be some of the most powerful people in the world!\n\n&gt; the poor were educated enough to come together and revolt\n\nWell, even the uneducated poor have revolted white violently in places like Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Korea and China. I don't know much about Europe, but I'm assuming that France and Russia were much the same?\n\nPeople who are angry enough to revolt are emotional. Emotional people are stupid and easily led by a charismatic leader. A leader who feeds that emotion to build his army. Once the leader has used them to 'win', he kills them. Useful idiots. Or dangerous competition. Either way: unnecessary after the revolution.\n\n&gt; Wall street's trickle down effect isn't working. \n\nWell, I don't think it is Wall-street's trickle down. But look at it this way: The rich don't put their money in mattresses or bury it in the back yard or put it in a big swimming pool like Scrooge McDuck. They either spend it (new car, pool, yacht, house, wife) or invest it (savings, low-yield/low-risk debt, higher(?)-yield/higher-risk equities, exotic trades and hedges, their own enterprise (LBO, etc.) or give it away (Ford Foundation, Bill&amp;Melinda Gates, Billionaire's pledge). Which of those does not directly or indirectly create jobs or help the poor?\n\nPut another way: If America isn't working out the way it is supposed to, the rich are fucked because they have no place to invest their money. For even selfish reasons. Even real-estate value assumes that there are other rich people out there. So the rich kind of need America to work -- even if it is only so that they can become more rich.\n\n", "id": "t1_cdxdngt", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "zArtLaffer", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdxqv0q", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sputnikbunny", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;  I think it\u2019s funny that the 80/20 rule works for wealth distribution\u2026 and natural phenomena\u2026 (Just read on Wikipedia). \n\nYeah ... zipf's law. And the small-world network people and the chaos people will tell you that 1/f distributions ('scale free') are a sign of self-organization. Order out of chaos. Which means *that* income distribution may well be a natural phenomena in a complex dynamic network system (the economy) as much as a stable ecosystem made of of populations of evolved creatures.\n\n&gt; On the topic of Wall street funding main street, in regards to hedge funds you won\u2019t believe. 100 plus million will be tied up in an investment for years\u2026. and how many people work in the back office? Usually 5-10. Maybe 20 if its billion plus firm \n\nWell, there are certainly outsized portfolios and returns per-person working at the fund. I agree with that. And the LPs are \"locked up\" for a while. I agree. The fund itself may move in and out of different positions more rapidly, though. Each \"hedge fund\" (which has over time become a fairly vague term) has a \"schtick\" or a \"trick\", an investment thesis, via which they generate their \"how we make our returns that beat the market\" story. Whatever. Do they help provide liquidity to the market at large? Maybe. I don't know. Does better market liquidity help main street? Maybe. I don't know. I can't argue for or against the modern form of hedge funds because I really don't know anything about them any more. They've changed too much since I did know something, and I haven't kept up. \n\nMy worry about main-street as intersects 'wall-street' is two-fold: Depository Financial Institutions (Consumer and merchant banks with checking and savings accounts) should not be able to use that DDA aggregate to collateralize market bets. Glass-stegal kind of got rid of that. Under Clinton (yes, with a Republican congress) we got rid of this for some reason. I don't know why we got rid of it, but it doesn't seem to have been positive. So, that's One. Number two is that when banks (these depository account asset banks) *should* be making their money doing \"loans\" to main-street. Yes, in current times they need to be careful (due-diligence). I get that. They aren't VC. But with essentially 0% interest rates, why would they lend *any* money. They essentially don't. Which is a problem for all of us ... because savings and loans is what they are supposed to do!\n\n&gt; It\u2019s true the rich may thrive on American wealth but let\u2019s not get too cozy about it. Our economic situation is not going to improve unless we do something about it.\n\nAgreed. So the question is to define the problem. What is one of the problems? Unemployment. Why? Labor not needed. Why? No (global) demand for American built products and services, at the price America can make/deliver them. Right? \n\nTell evil capitalists to hire more? To do what? There's no demand for American-built products. Why not? Expensive. Raise minimum wage? That makes it worse -- products more expensive. \"The rich should fix it\" -- well, they *do* fix their problem ... by exporting labor requirements to China and robots. Still leaves us with unemployment.\n\nSo, to solve unemployment, we need more demand for products/services. OK, --give-- everyone a job, those people will have demand? Well, sure -- they'll demand cheap products from China. American employer's will go bankrupt (no customers) and we are ... right back here.\n\nThen, what do we do about it? Well, let's break this down: why isn't America competitive with it's ability to build inexpensive consumer products? (Ignoring the fact that we are -- America is the largest manufacturing country in the world; we just don't need that many people to do it...)\n\nHint1: There is an answer to this core problem, if you break it down to its core elements.\n\nHint2: Having the government mandate prosperity has never in the history of the world ever worked.\n\nWe can chat about this later.

Just resubmerging myself into the fun world of reddit!\n\n&gt;Which means that income distribution may well be a natural phenomena in a complex dynamic network system (the economy) as much as a stable ecosystem made of populations of evolved creatures.&lt;\n\nI think your likely to be very right. I think any new economic situation needs to account for some economic diversity. Interestingly 80/20 rule may be an ultimate goal? Where 20% may be more wealthy than the 80% but both should have a *better* quality of life. (Is this how this works?)\n\nHere is what I find a problem with the current buying and selling of corporate stock. Corporate sock is..... largely no longer a means to build capital to improve the company's product, its become a currency and the only expectation is to get some sort of quick ROI of 20% (that's HUGE). \n\nSmaller companies fear going public because of there is a lack of diversification for controlling interests, the company  loses their autonomy and is subject to the whims of their shareholders. I think there would be a lot of supporting evidence that the current corporate structure hurts small businesses. (I think this sort of research will be important in support for a new entity structure. Specifically to prove that technological advancements cannot easily come to fruition because seed capital must be obtained privately not publicly...I'll come back to this point)\n\nIn this economy I am under the assumption that \n\n1) There is a lack of jobs:\n\nCompanies (as previously discussed) have squeezed two jobs into one and have been increasingly pushing for productivity.\n\n2) American products are needed, we just have to change the products:\n\nThere are technological advancements every day! We could be building hover boards (heh)! But do we allow for new small business to really thrive. Is these products too expensive to build. &lt;---- and this is where I think the real problem is. The cost of todays goods are just too costly. You would need large sums of capital, but there's a problem.... banks are not loaning. Plus going public means losing autonomy of your business. \n\n&gt;Then, what do we do about it? Well, let's break this down: why isn't America competitive with it's ability to build inexpensive consumer products? (Ignoring the fact that we are -- America is the largest manufacturing country in the world; we just don't need that many people to do it...)&lt;\n\nYes this is key! I think its very important to do an analysis of why the costs of goods are rising. *If and it is what I suspect it is* It's the demand for ROI. I will have to do further research.  (But its the pressure that stock only increases if there is growth of net profit year after year.. which I've state before since NP is on a bell curve this is a huge problem. And therefore the price will artificially inflate)\n\nIf I have explained myself well, I'm going to bring this full circle\n\nIf the Top 1% wanted to simulate into a new 80/20 model wouldn't they just have to directly contribute capital to these small businesses? And it looks to me they have a lot of capital to contribute. Take their corporate stocks away and give these 1%ters a new investment opportunity. \"Investors Fees\" \n\nSo here is the unknown:\n\nDo you think it's possible if we dissolved corporate stocks and in turn asked the 1% to invest in these investors fees- Would capital flow more freely? Let's stop trading stocks like a currency and actually create new capital.\n\nSide Note:\nYes, because glass-steagall act's clock ran out ... and because of Alan Greenspan's human optimism, there went the housing crash.  Alan Greenspan turned a blind eye to the interest only loans knowing that they would default largely because of his confidence that banks wouldn't take any actions that would allow for the banks to collapse. He assumed banks would not intentionally hurt their own business....then we learned the terms \"too big to fail\". Sadly we all put faith in \"experts\" but really, experts are only good guessers. \n\nIt's great talking to you too! I think I may like to peruse this idea further and write a more detailed report.

Sorry!\n\nYes, this only attacks publicly traded stocks put on the market. All publicly traded stocks are byproducts of corporations. These include IPOs. And since the full plan is to transition ALL CORPS to this new structure, publicly traded stocks would be extinct.\n\n There are other forms of publicly traded equity. These would be publicly traded private equity funds (\"PEFs\"). These are Partnerships that combine LP interests in various other partnerships. Investors in PEFs will receive performance fees based on hurdle rates and income for the lower tiered partnerships. Essentially this falls under the same SEC rules as hedge funds.  What I like about PEF's (and I'm willing to leave these alone) is that they are not trading partnership interests daily or even hourly. Why? SEC Laws already state you need to have wealth of $1 million plus to be an investor. That is because investing is so risky. Good returns on PEF's take years of 5-10. So that would be a long term investment. The other benefits of PEFs is that SEC is very specific about how these funds are trading and are overseeing these very well in my opinion.  Note these SEC regulations do not come into play when you just buy a share of stock in a corporation.  Plus today if you want to be a little guy and invest in PEF you would have to buy publicly traded shares of a corp that invests in PEFs\u2026 well corps would be erased in this plan. So there goes that and PEF's after axing corps would still be under the SEC rules. Truth be told if you have the wealth to invest in PEFs, sure you can make great returns but you can also fail miserably! So I say let the rich keep taking these risks\u2026. it's like specialized gambling in my opinion, from my experience most don't do well. Its just a long term game of craps. \n\nOkay so here are opposing argument to your response. I'm going to boil these down. Hopefully I have fully grasp what your saying.\n\n1) Technological advancements cannot be stopped\u2026. and at the end of the day they will become successful.  And specifically we're talking advancements that change the status quo.\n\nA. Ah but we are only looking at success stories. There is a very full possibility that corps can swallow up good ideas. This is done  first when a person creates a patent. The creator of this patent probably has one of two choices. The can receive seed money from investors. Or they can sell their patent to the highest bidder. Unfortunately if the highest bidder is one of the largest corps in the world how could any amount of seed money compete? There is also speculation that these corps could instill fear, by threatening lawsuits which may make the uneducated submit to a patent sale. Its speculation but it certainly happens. Ack! I really don't want to get into specifics examples on a sunday. lol. \n\n2) Motivation could change everything\n\nA Yes. But this motivated person would have to have two qualities and be a lucky contender (if the situation above happened). For one they would have to be intelligent enough to create a patent. Secondly they would have to shun corporate money and take the lessor seed money. They may decide this for fame or creative control. But what if they just wanted to be rich? What if they were not philosophers and are just byproducts of out shitty college education system that focuses on learning trades and not expanding minds to such crazy things as philosophy. (kay so my hobby is philosophy and we philosophers got a lot of problems with today's world). Thirdly they would have to find seed money! Easier said than done! \u2026. Are we going to wait for this chanve to be fulfilled until we can get some decent technological innovation the opposes the status quo? Why not just facilitate the system so these technological advancements can happen a lot easier. \n\n3) What happens to the prices of our products??  Hey, we all like products, they allow us to be more profitable.\n\nThis idea works with capitalism. Yup, the only thing thats being changed is how you  culminate investors and please \"founders\". All the economic laws of capitalism still apply.\n\n4) Wealth gap? What wealth gap? (this may be a sideline topic to this discussion but I love talking about this!) \n\nWell the wealth gap is more clear for me to see for one simple reason. I'm at the high end of the wealth gap but my parents are at the bottom end. Mom works 50 plus hours and dad is full time worker who has a very physical job. He's getting older and each day the job is harder and harder for him to do. They always were at the min wage level so they only got enough $ together to buy a modest condo in their late 40s. And that is because they became blindsided about the growing cost of living. As a result they have to put in a lot of blood and sweat but don't have much to show for it (understandably this is relative but i believe advance civilizations should bring quality of life up\u2026 not create more of a struggle against the successful top)\n\nSo it's not class envy for me\u2026 this will be the hardest thing to explain but let me try. It's years of reading philosophy and translating it to not just sentiments but mathematics. (and I'm not lying this took years of learning!) But I will boil it down to how i went from a business mind to a belief in a sort of caring that should be extended to every human being.\n\nInherently our social structure today has very strong ideas that a person must 1) work hard to get to the top 2) a person is in the hands of their own destiny 3) unsuccessful persons is due to laziness or a sort of darwinian result of our nature.\n\nPhilosophy argues:\n\n1) the inherent structure of this system (that is capitalism) forces failure:\nheres the long a short of it wrapped in a neat metaphor.. and i just thought of this metaphor so here we go (lol!): You want plants in your garden to grow. You have one garden where you nourish the plants with enriched soil and the second garden you just throw seeds on the ground and see what happens. Throwing seeds in the ground does not give nearly as good results. Actually the tossed seeds do terribly. The tossed seeds translates to the poorer kids. #1 the education system in the citys they live in is shoty, #2 kids in poorer families have to deal with physical and mental anxieties such as inadequate food, abuse and lack of parental guidance since both parents must work. #3 Since these kids feel like they cannot be apart of society they become apart of something else; gangs, which leeds to crime.\n\nSo\u2026.kids in enriched soil, these are the kids living in towns with their is  wealth. Towns revenue increases from property taxes  and those towns can provide a better education. Also kids of the Middle class/wealthy come from fewer broken homes. Ect. and we'll move on\u2026 I think thats enough.\n\n2) The system only allows people with skills that can be used on the job to flourish, while others are forced to struggle:\n\nWhy should we allow some people to fail. Do they deserve to fail because of our darwinian structure? Many people can easily say \"sure\" there will be failures. But lets go here: We have a unconditional request of one another.  You may not feel it because we are so closed off from each individual person but it exists. We all request love, help, acceptance and even respect from one another. When we improve society so we can be more moral and accepting of one another we become happier people. Not only do you benefit from the good feelings but others benefit. I say lets make this societally less darwinian. And the argument that humans are humans and need to conquer over the failed\u2026 well i say neigh! We have much more heart. \n\nI can go into a full explanations if you are interested, I'd have to point you to some essays I could probably find online  but I just wanted a over simplified idea for now (just to see if it works). But I'll be happy to divulge further if necessary.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdwt461", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386534685", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdw7lsg", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428347663, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdw8cfe", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386466033", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdvdav0", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428348008, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sorry I'm just getting back!\nI agree with your business model. The new structure would turn VC into something similar to a  combination capital investment and a management fee found in a hedge fund.\n\nHeres an Example: there is the Venture A who invests 110,000 and Venture B who invests 30,000. \"Entity A\" is the business and then there is the Founder of the business. (so theres two venture capitalist and the Founder does not have any capital to contribute. Founder fees is 6%. Investors fee is 2% of VC Contributed  / Expected VC. Expected VC is $150,000 (similarly you estimate how many stocks should be sold to collect the necessary capital) and these fees are not paid until the 5th business day of Year 2 so they are still payable in year 1)\nHeres how the balance sheet would work It's year 1 of operations:\n\nAssets:\n\nCash 100,000\n\nInventory: 10,000\n\nTotal Assets 110,000\n\nLiabilities:\n\nNotes Payable: 20,000\n\nAccrued Founders Fee: 14,486\n\nAccrued Payable to Venture A: 5,311\n\nAccrued Payable to Venture B: 1,449\n\nEquity:\n\nVenture A: 110,000\n\nVenture B: 30,000\n\nEntity A - Net losses over revenue: (71,246)\n\nTotal Equity and Liabs 110,000\n\nIncome Statement:\n\nRevenue: 200,000\n\nInventory used: 70,000\n\nOperating Expenses:  180,000\n\nFounder Fee: 14,486\n\nInvestor Fee: 6,760\n\nNet Loss: (71,246)\n\nCashflow\n\nBeginning Cash: 0\n\nNet Loss: (71,246)\n\nInventory: (10,000)\n\nVenture Capital: 140,0000\n\nNotes Payable: 20,000\n\nFounder Fee Payable: 14,486\n\nInvestor Fee Payable: 6,760\n\nNet Change in Cash: $100,000\n\nCash flows allows the investor fee and founder fee to be paid in full. If this wasn't the case a waterfall would have to be set up per the articles of \"corporation/organization\"\n\n\nSo heres the whats up:\n\nI'm essentially creating the regulations for this new type of company. And ultimately I would like to appeal to capitalists and socialists alike. I don't necessarily have to kill wall street but i would like to change the animal. Does Wall Street  have to be so volatile, and if net profits are stagnate does investors need to jump ship?\n\nI would like to give more pie to the workers but thus far, I've fallen short of how to solve this. I am definitely leaving more room for regulations to better solve this problem. Really I would like to allow the \"people\" to shape this new org through social media. Just as lobbyists get a chance get to influence our current laws. \n\nI have to agree with you. The capitalist system has worked. But will it continue to work in the best interest of the people? To me the benefits of capitalism, like net profit, is a bell curve. It was wonderful in the beginning. It built innovation, gave people motivation to create, to act  proactively in commerce and ultimately improve our societal structure.  But currently we are falling down the bell curve and in a period where corporations are finding solutions  to grow net profits that are not beneficial to society as a whole. Since they cannot allow for net profits to stagnate, they have begun to turn to unethical practices (i think you would agree without further explanation).  Long and short corporations are influencing regulations regardless of what is best for society as a whole. As an example I think corps are preventing new technologies that would diminish current product markets. For example corporations have spent a lot of $ on lobbyist to promote the use of oil even though there may be other viable energy solutions. Fuel efficient cars have struggled, even when ultimately the consumer doesn't care what type of energy they use as long as its affordable and works.\n\nAt the end of the day I would like  this new entity idea to solve 4 things\n\n1) I would like to promote technological advancement regardless of large corporate influence (and i have an idea on patent law as well. but that's another topic i guess)\n\n2) Change the hyperactive stock market to a more of a market with long term yields. \n\n3) Spread wealth  to the middle and lower classes through better wages\n\n4) Reduce the power of corporations. (I believe if we change the nature of wall street we can reduce the income gap and therefore corporate and even individual wealth and thus their power)\n\nI hope to get lots of minds involved in this project so we can solve this problem all together. The only reason I would like to limit certain \"communist\" or \"socialist\" regulations is so we can still keep the concept of \"the free market\" so the idea can actually be acceptable by most people. And I recognize this will be a challenge for everyone,,,, it does make solving the issues that much harder.\n\nBottom line I'm trying to rework the system so we all have a much better future. Right now I'm fearing that our democracy is just being eaten up by wealth and corporate power. And that looks like a pretty dark future to me. \n\nLet me know if you need more info, and what you would think it would take to \"sell\" someone on the idea. \n\nThanks so much, I appreciate it!", "edited": 1386464684, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdw7lsg", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386464227", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdvc8kt", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428362758, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdvdav0", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386367525", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}

More products? \n  - Mezzanine --&gt; M&amp;A. OR\n  - Go public.

Is it easier to do a one-size-fits-all for everyone and *hope* that a benevolent government run by people with the right-color shirts help until the team changes at half-time?\n\n", "id": "t1_cdvdav0", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "zArtLaffer", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "id": "t1_cdw7lsg", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sputnikbunny", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "selftext": "Thanks for your detailed work-through on the financials. And, to level-set this conversation, I was trying to understand (hence the questions) as opposed to proposing anything myself or debating you.\n\nThat last one, I might start doing (a very little) here by throwing up some alternative factoids or perspectives. And then, maybe we can get into what it would take to \"sell\" someone on the idea. Recognizing from the outset that you can't sell it to everyone in the ecosystem because any systemic shift from the status-quo will have winners and losers.\n\n&gt; Does Wall Street have to be so volatile\n\nWho knows? Even off Wall-street with have things like the Bitcoin exchanges. I'm guessing that you are talking about the publicly traded equity markets? If so, is the volatility or hype around things like Facebook or Twitter IPOs or Apple the fault of Wall-street or marketing hype and lemmings?\n\n&gt; But will is continue to work in the best interest of the people? \n\nYou seem to break this into three parts: Wall-street volatility, technological innovation coupled with corporatism (lobbyists pushing for regulations that limit competition and populism destroying strength of the corporation) and the wealth gap.\n\nFor the first, I'll let my last question stand.\n\nFor the second, I would take a longer lens. When Carnegie was building rail-roads, the water-ways people pushed back *hard* on that nonsense. It failed to ultimately succeed because of west-of-the-great-lakes we don't have options thing, and because of the Rockefeller thing but it was a real thing for over 30-40 years. Rockefeller: government broke him up. 20 years later, *each* of the baby-standards were larger than the original at the time of the break-up. IBM: by the time the government got around to curtailing them, technology had kind of \"gotten\" them. AT&amp;T: same thing. Microsoft: same thing. Government response to monopoly power is slow and reactive. In an evolving tech landscape, the new-new thing will kill the old-old guy ... even if they try to stop it. They can't.\n\nIs innovation dead? Don't know, but I see lots of nifty stuff I don't remember from 20 years ago (cheaply, at least): high-speed internet, wireless internet, (cheap) cell phones, GPS, Siri on iPhones, $200 laptops, DVRs, Netflix, ... there are more in industrial and less-consumer spaces like minimills for steel production and MRI machines. 3D printing. High density FPGAs (download your own open-source circuits!). Desktop genomics. mRNA arrays.\n\nI'm not seeing it. I see corporatism as pure corruption ... and not new. I see technological innovation as being alive and well. Volatility? Is it Wall-streets fault or the lemmings fault?\n\nAnd, wealth-gap ... I'm not seeing it. Maybe you make $100K/year. Or maybe you make $100B/year. If you don't make that $100B through corruption by selling me something that makes my life easier/better (like MS Office) for $100. My productivity improves 500% for $100? Sign-me up. I make more money. You earned my $100. And the simple fact that you have $100B doesn't really affect me. If it did, that is simple old-fashioned envy (or class-envy, which is usually populism) and not worthy of adult consideration.\n\nSo, I see poor people with cars, air-conditioning, laptops, high-speed internet, smart-phones and two flat-screen TVs, and I am reminded of words from my old Ethiopian cab driver: He wanted to come to America and see a country where poor people are fat.\n\nSo, I get your enthusiasm and wanting to solve \"big\" problems. I admire and applaud that. But ... I guess I'm having a tough time seeing the problem here.\n\nIf I were to \"attack\" a real-world problem (this is me), it probably would have to do something with unemployment, expensive health-care delivery, keeping the air clean BY finding clean ways to deliver electricity cheaply NOT by fools-errand mandated solutions (like Solar), higher-ed bubble: It is ridiculous that people graduate with $100K in debt for a degree in Hispanic-Transgendered studies and no ability to get a job. Any job. What is everyone thinking!?! That shit needs to stop.\n\nAnyway, that may have edged over into being preachy. Sorry. You probably ought to focus on the question part of this post! :-)\n\nLater, after I have noodled through cost/benefit of a structural change a bit, we can brain out a way to \"sell\" enough eco-system participants to get the sea-change you are looking for.\n\n", "id": "t1_cdw8cfe", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "zArtLaffer", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdwt461", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sputnikbunny", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdwt4zk", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sputnikbunny", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cdwt461", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428337840, "controversiality": 0, "body": "So the problems (and I very much agree) we should address\n\n1) unemployment\n\n2) healthcare \n\n3) cleaner air (so thats improving technology)\n\n4) education is waaaay over priced\n\nI also have to divulge into the cost/benefit of this new entity plan but i think this will be wrapped up in these explinations\n\n1) How to increase unemployment with this new entity structure:\n\tJobs have currently been under pressure. Companies are so large they have reached their max market share. Therefore in order for profits to not stagnate they have to reduce operating costs. This eventually means reducing the costs of wages. This squeezes two jobs into one. The new entity structure alleviates this because via taken direct labor and operating costs out of the equation, it also allows for returns for investors even when profits are stagnate. \n\n(I'm going to break into a rant. In what effing world would investments become unprofitable when there is a steady stream of profits (with no growth) Eff you wall street ! The way stocks work is against all logic! Good thing this can be repaired)\n\n2) Healthcare.\n\tHealthcare is a beast. Most drug companies and medical equip companies are private. And Health insurance companies are partnerships (wait\u2026 wait i don't know this for sure I'm just guessing from memory. And someone could school me on this statement). That would have to be dealt with by other laws and regulations. the only thing the new entity structure resolves is that corps wont want to cut these expenses. They may want to increase them. Why? less net profit equals less taxes. We could improve this through tax regulations though. \n\n3) Cleaner air Aka how can new technologies survive: \nYes I have a separate solution for how patents should be treated. So now i'll give you the details. Currently if your a patent holder you own a company that creates a product. And your the ONLY company that creates that product. Unless you sell your patent. Well Eff That! Lets change this. \n\nHeres the new solution:\nYour create a patent. You go through the govt and get that patent on the system (remember its public). Here's what happens next: Multiple companies likes your patent and want to build your product. All of these multiple companies gives you a \"Patent Fee.\" The fee is calc'ed as follows  (Revenues - inventory costs)/inventory costs * (revenues - inventory costs) * x%. Just like a founders fee.  Multiple companies will create a product at their own set price and the invisible hand of supply and demand and capitalism begins. Competition ensues, capitalism thrives and thrives even BETTER! \n\n4) Education is way too overpriced:\nHopefully taking the the stress out of operating costs will aid companies to pay more benefits to its workers, such as paid education and helping with student loans. The problem is educational institutions are currently non-profits. *This is important* This reduces my arguments potency because this new entity structure would act much like non-profits and we can look to non-profits like educational institutions to see what the results of this new organization may just be like. However Non-profits to do not give fees to investors so maybe this would calm the fever for wealth but this is speculation. Non profits are about legacy, meaning your name on the business inst. building. This is not something I would except my new entity to have a problem with. But who knows? I believe this is an weakness the needs to be addressed.\n\nWhats very interesting to me now is not only do i have to convince someone that the idea is good idea,  I may have to sway their heart about the current state of capitalism. I may have to give them reason to think that current corporate entity structure could be improved so more groups of people could succeed. Do you agree? \n\nWhat you think thus far :-)\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdwt4zk", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386534731", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Hmmm. A lot to think through and about. Made you busy typing on a Sunday! Sorry...\n\nThere is something in agent-based game-theoretic simulations that yield what they call evolutionarily stable strategies. To use one of the simple examples, there are a bunch of agents, each of them will have a strategy (which vary across the population) and they will meet each other and play a game of (say) prisoner's dilemma. Depending on their respective success, they reproduce or die. The population will then grow or shrink. And there will be (often) a couple of strategies that emerge in the population to be dominant. Maybe 1/3 of strategy A and 2/3 of strategy B.\n\nIf you end up with 100% of strategy A or 100% of strategy B, often the populations will shrink and die off.\n\nThere are different models, but the designers of the simulations are trying to see if (and how) altruism (for example) can evolve.\n\nIt's interesting to me studying different places (I have lived in the US, in eastern-europe, in Japan and visited over 3 dozen countries over the years) ... is that it is possible for everyone to be equally poor. It doesn't seem to be possible for everyone to be equally rich. But what is also interesting is that where there is income disparity, yes, there are winners and losers. But in *many* of the countries where it is possible to become rich through innovation or technical entrepreneurship (instead of pure feudal inheritance or friends-of-the-family corruption), when the \"pie\" gets bigger, the rich *do* get richer. But so do the poor. \n\nSo it comes down to a question of whether we want to all be equally poor, or allow some super-rich to emerge (like Bill Gates) because he enriches all of us ... and where the \"rich\" pay 70% of the income taxes in the US ... and enable the poor to be safer. Not because it is unfair, but because super-wealth enables us to be able to help our brother in that system?\n\n", "id": "t1_cdwu210", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "zArtLaffer", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "id": "t1_cdx3a70", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sputnikbunny", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "selftext": "&gt; I wonder if in this agent based model ideally we would want a mix so the majority would be a upper middle class. If A is rich, and B is poor we'd like a majority to be a mix of both AB. A mix were AB has a healthy amount of A and smaller amount of B? \n\nWell, the simulations that I am referring to have each individual have their own strategy. And then populations of strategies will emerge with different ratios. What is interesting to me is that a blended strategy system will end up with a systemic better total outcome. I used this in my side agent-based computational economics research, and you can do things like creating a \"computational theory of the firm\". And you end up with individuals creating firms (creation), growth, stagnation, decline, death as outcomes of the ecosystem of competing firms made up out of individuals.\n\n &gt; so many poor and few rich is because rich carries \n\nNot necessarily the reason, but it goes together. Both for income, savings, return on investment, entrepreneurial activity and effectiveness-of-any-human-action, you end up with a Pareto-like distribution. The 80/20 rule it is called in English. After an Italian economist/mathmetician a long time ago that noticed that regardless of the system, 20% of the people had 80% of the money (and vice-versa). This has been generalized by theorists and even a practitioner named Koch (no relation to the brothers, worked at BCG as an analyst and then an entrepreneural turn-around guy) that: 80% of results come from 20% of activities. Now, we can't predict from this theory *which* people will win or lose, but we can predict across time and space that this distribution is largely true.\n\n&gt; power because wealthier people have more access to information, access to consumer goods, access to technological advancements. \n\nWell, in that case, the poor in America and here on Reddit must be some of the most powerful people in the world!\n\n&gt; the poor were educated enough to come together and revolt\n\nWell, even the uneducated poor have revolted white violently in places like Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Korea and China. I don't know much about Europe, but I'm assuming that France and Russia were much the same?\n\nPeople who are angry enough to revolt are emotional. Emotional people are stupid and easily led by a charismatic leader. A leader who feeds that emotion to build his army. Once the leader has used them to 'win', he kills them. Useful idiots. Or dangerous competition. Either way: unnecessary after the revolution.\n\n&gt; Wall street's trickle down effect isn't working. \n\nWell, I don't think it is Wall-street's trickle down. But look at it this way: The rich don't put their money in mattresses or bury it in the back yard or put it in a big swimming pool like Scrooge McDuck. They either spend it (new car, pool, yacht, house, wife) or invest it (savings, low-yield/low-risk debt, higher(?)-yield/higher-risk equities, exotic trades and hedges, their own enterprise (LBO, etc.) or give it away (Ford Foundation, Bill&amp;Melinda Gates, Billionaire's pledge). Which of those does not directly or indirectly create jobs or help the poor?\n\nPut another way: If America isn't working out the way it is supposed to, the rich are fucked because they have no place to invest their money. For even selfish reasons. Even real-estate value assumes that there are other rich people out there. So the rich kind of need America to work -- even if it is only so that they can become more rich.\n\n", "id": "t1_cdxdngt", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "zArtLaffer", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdxqv0q", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sputnikbunny", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;  I think it\u2019s funny that the 80/20 rule works for wealth distribution\u2026 and natural phenomena\u2026 (Just read on Wikipedia). \n\nYeah ... zipf's law. And the small-world network people and the chaos people will tell you that 1/f distributions ('scale free') are a sign of self-organization. Order out of chaos. Which means *that* income distribution may well be a natural phenomena in a complex dynamic network system (the economy) as much as a stable ecosystem made of of populations of evolved creatures.\n\n&gt; On the topic of Wall street funding main street, in regards to hedge funds you won\u2019t believe. 100 plus million will be tied up in an investment for years\u2026. and how many people work in the back office? Usually 5-10. Maybe 20 if its billion plus firm \n\nWell, there are certainly outsized portfolios and returns per-person working at the fund. I agree with that. And the LPs are \"locked up\" for a while. I agree. The fund itself may move in and out of different positions more rapidly, though. Each \"hedge fund\" (which has over time become a fairly vague term) has a \"schtick\" or a \"trick\", an investment thesis, via which they generate their \"how we make our returns that beat the market\" story. Whatever. Do they help provide liquidity to the market at large? Maybe. I don't know. Does better market liquidity help main street? Maybe. I don't know. I can't argue for or against the modern form of hedge funds because I really don't know anything about them any more. They've changed too much since I did know something, and I haven't kept up. \n\nMy worry about main-street as intersects 'wall-street' is two-fold: Depository Financial Institutions (Consumer and merchant banks with checking and savings accounts) should not be able to use that DDA aggregate to collateralize market bets. Glass-stegal kind of got rid of that. Under Clinton (yes, with a Republican congress) we got rid of this for some reason. I don't know why we got rid of it, but it doesn't seem to have been positive. So, that's One. Number two is that when banks (these depository account asset banks) *should* be making their money doing \"loans\" to main-street. Yes, in current times they need to be careful (due-diligence). I get that. They aren't VC. But with essentially 0% interest rates, why would they lend *any* money. They essentially don't. Which is a problem for all of us ... because savings and loans is what they are supposed to do!\n\n&gt; It\u2019s true the rich may thrive on American wealth but let\u2019s not get too cozy about it. Our economic situation is not going to improve unless we do something about it.\n\nAgreed. So the question is to define the problem. What is one of the problems? Unemployment. Why? Labor not needed. Why? No (global) demand for American built products and services, at the price America can make/deliver them. Right? \n\nTell evil capitalists to hire more? To do what? There's no demand for American-built products. Why not? Expensive. Raise minimum wage? That makes it worse -- products more expensive. \"The rich should fix it\" -- well, they *do* fix their problem ... by exporting labor requirements to China and robots. Still leaves us with unemployment.\n\nSo, to solve unemployment, we need more demand for products/services. OK, --give-- everyone a job, those people will have demand? Well, sure -- they'll demand cheap products from China. American employer's will go bankrupt (no customers) and we are ... right back here.\n\nThen, what do we do about it? Well, let's break this down: why isn't America competitive with it's ability to build inexpensive consumer products? (Ignoring the fact that we are -- America is the largest manufacturing country in the world; we just don't need that many people to do it...)\n\nHint1: There is an answer to this core problem, if you break it down to its core elements.\n\nHint2: Having the government mandate prosperity has never in the history of the world ever worked.\n\nWe can chat about this later.

I think any new economic situation needs to account for some economic diversity. Interestingly 80/20 rule may be an ultimate goal? Where 20% may be more wealthy than the 80% but both should have a *better* quality of life. (Is this how this works?)\n\nHere is what I find a problem with the current buying and selling of corporate stock. Corporate sock is..... largely no longer a means to build capital to improve the company's product, its become a currency and the only expectation is to get some sort of quick ROI of 20% (that's HUGE). \n\nSmaller companies fear going public because of there is a lack of diversification for controlling interests, the company  loses their autonomy and is subject to the whims of their shareholders. I think there would be a lot of supporting evidence that the current corporate structure hurts small businesses. (I think this sort of research will be important in support for a new entity structure. Specifically to prove that technological advancements cannot easily come to fruition because seed capital must be obtained privately not publicly...I'll come back to this point)\n\nIn this economy I am under the assumption that \n\n1) There is a lack of jobs:\n\nCompanies (as previously discussed) have squeezed two jobs into one and have been increasingly pushing for productivity.\n\n2) American products are needed, we just have to change the products:\n\nThere are technological advancements every day! We could be building hover boards (heh)! But do we allow for new small business to really thrive. Is these products too expensive to build. &lt;---- and this is where I think the real problem is. The cost of todays goods are just too costly. You would need large sums of capital, but there's a problem.... banks are not loaning. Plus going public means losing autonomy of your business. \n\n&gt;Then, what do we do about it? Well, let's break this down: why isn't America competitive with it's ability to build inexpensive consumer products? (Ignoring the fact that we are -- America is the largest manufacturing country in the world; we just don't need that many people to do it...)&lt;\n\nYes this is key! I think its very important to do an analysis of why the costs of goods are rising. *If and it is what I suspect it is* It's the demand for ROI. I will have to do further research.  (But its the pressure that stock only increases if there is growth of net profit year after year.. which I've state before since NP is on a bell curve this is a huge problem. And therefore the price will artificially inflate)\n\nIf I have explained myself well, I'm going to bring this full circle\n\nIf the Top 1% wanted to simulate into a new 80/20 model wouldn't they just have to directly contribute capital to these small businesses? And it looks to me they have a lot of capital to contribute. Take their corporate stocks away and give these 1%ters a new investment opportunity. \"Investors Fees\" \n\nSo here is the unknown:\n\nDo you think it's possible if we dissolved corporate stocks and in turn asked the 1% to invest in these investors fees- Would capital flow more freely? Let's stop trading stocks like a currency and actually create new capital.\n\nSide Note:\nYes, because glass-steagall act's clock ran out ... and because of Alan Greenspan's human optimism, there went the housing crash.  Alan Greenspan turned a blind eye to the interest only loans knowing that they would default largely because of his confidence that banks wouldn't take any actions that would allow for the banks to collapse.

Sorry!\n\nYes, this only attacks publicly traded stocks put on the market. All publicly traded stocks are byproducts of corporations. These include IPOs. And since the full plan is to transition ALL CORPS to this new structure, publicly traded stocks would be extinct.\n\n There are other forms of publicly traded equity. These would be publicly traded private equity funds (\"PEFs\"). These are Partnerships that combine LP interests in various other partnerships. Investors in PEFs will receive performance fees based on hurdle rates and income for the lower tiered partnerships. Essentially this falls under the same SEC rules as hedge funds.  What I like about PEF's (and I'm willing to leave these alone) is that they are not trading partnership interests daily or even hourly. Why? SEC Laws already state you need to have wealth of $1 million plus to be an investor. That is because investing is so risky. Good returns on PEF's take years of 5-10. So that would be a long term investment. The other benefits of PEFs is that SEC is very specific about how these funds are trading and are overseeing these very well in my opinion.  Note these SEC regulations do not come into play when you just buy a share of stock in a corporation.  Plus today if you want to be a little guy and invest in PEF you would have to buy publicly traded shares of a corp that invests in PEFs\u2026 well corps would be erased in this plan. So there goes that and PEF's after axing corps would still be under the SEC rules. Truth be told if you have the wealth to invest in PEFs, sure you can make great returns but you can also fail miserably! So I say let the rich keep taking these risks\u2026. it's like specialized gambling in my opinion, from my experience most don't do well. Its just a long term game of craps. \n\nOkay so here are opposing argument to your response. I'm going to boil these down. Hopefully I have fully grasp what your saying.\n\n1) Technological advancements cannot be stopped\u2026. and at the end of the day they will become successful.  And specifically we're talking advancements that change the status quo.\n\nA. Ah but we are only looking at success stories. There is a very full possibility that corps can swallow up good ideas. This is done  first when a person creates a patent. The creator of this patent probably has one of two choices. The can receive seed money from investors. Or they can sell their patent to the highest bidder. Unfortunately if the highest bidder is one of the largest corps in the world how could any amount of seed money compete? There is also speculation that these corps could instill fear, by threatening lawsuits which may make the uneducated submit to a patent sale. Its speculation but it certainly happens. Ack! I really don't want to get into specifics examples on a sunday. lol. \n\n2) Motivation could change everything\n\nA Yes. But this motivated person would have to have two qualities and be a lucky contender (if the situation above happened). For one they would have to be intelligent enough to create a patent. Secondly they would have to shun corporate money and take the lessor seed money. They may decide this for fame or creative control. But what if they just wanted to be rich? What if they were not philosophers and are just byproducts of out shitty college education system that focuses on learning trades and not expanding minds to such crazy things as philosophy. (kay so my hobby is philosophy and we philosophers got a lot of problems with today's world). Thirdly they would have to find seed money! Easier said than done! \u2026. Are we going to wait for this chanve to be fulfilled until we can get some decent technological innovation the opposes the status quo? Why not just facilitate the system so these technological advancements can happen a lot easier. \n\n3) What happens to the prices of our products??  Hey, we all like products, they allow us to be more profitable.\n\nThis idea works with capitalism. Yup, the only thing thats being changed is how you  culminate investors and please \"founders\". All the economic laws of capitalism still apply.\n\n4) Wealth gap? What wealth gap? (this may be a sideline topic to this discussion but I love talking about this!) \n\nWell the wealth gap is more clear for me to see for one simple reason. I'm at the high end of the wealth gap but my parents are at the bottom end. Mom works 50 plus hours and dad is full time worker who has a very physical job. He's getting older and each day the job is harder and harder for him to do. They always were at the min wage level so they only got enough $ together to buy a modest condo in their late 40s. And that is because they became blindsided about the growing cost of living. As a result they have to put in a lot of blood and sweat but don't have much to show for it (understandably this is relative but i believe advance civilizations should bring quality of life up\u2026 not create more of a struggle against the successful top)\n\nSo it's not class envy for me\u2026 this will be the hardest thing to explain but let me try. It's years of reading philosophy and translating it to not just sentiments but mathematics. (and I'm not lying this took years of learning!) But I will boil it down to how i went from a business mind to a belief in a sort of caring that should be extended to every human being.\n\nInherently our social structure today has very strong ideas that a person must 1) work hard to get to the top 2) a person is in the hands of their own destiny 3) unsuccessful persons is due to laziness or a sort of darwinian result of our nature.\n\nPhilosophy argues:\n\n1) the inherent structure of this system (that is capitalism) forces failure:\nheres the long a short of it wrapped in a neat metaphor.. and i just thought of this metaphor so here we go (lol!): You want plants in your garden to grow. You have one garden where you nourish the plants with enriched soil and the second garden you just throw seeds on the ground and see what happens. Throwing seeds in the ground does not give nearly as good results. Actually the tossed seeds do terribly. The tossed seeds translates to the poorer kids. #1 the education system in the citys they live in is shoty, #2 kids in poorer families have to deal with physical and mental anxieties such as inadequate food, abuse and lack of parental guidance since both parents must work. #3 Since these kids feel like they cannot be apart of society they become apart of something else; gangs, which leeds to crime.\n\nSo\u2026.kids in enriched soil, these are the kids living in towns with their is  wealth. Towns revenue increases from property taxes  and those towns can provide a better education. Also kids of the Middle class/wealthy come from fewer broken homes. Ect. and we'll move on\u2026 I think thats enough.\n\n2) The system only allows people with skills that can be used on the job to flourish, while others are forced to struggle:\n\nWhy should we allow some people to fail. Do they deserve to fail because of our darwinian structure? Many people can easily say \"sure\" there will be failures. But lets go here: We have a unconditional request of one another.  You may not feel it because we are so closed off from each individual person but it exists. We all request love, help, acceptance and even respect from one another. When we improve society so we can be more moral and accepting of one another we become happier people. Not only do you benefit from the good feelings but others benefit. I say lets make this societally less darwinian. And the argument that humans are humans and need to conquer over the failed\u2026 well i say neigh! We have much more heart. \n\nI can go into a full explanations if you are interested, I'd have to point you to some essays I could probably find online  but I just wanted a over simplified idea for now (just to see if it works). But I'll be happy to divulge further if necessary.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdwt461", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386534685", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdw7lsg", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428347663, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdw8cfe", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386466033", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdvdav0", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428348008, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sorry I'm just getting back!\nI agree with your business model. The new structure would turn VC into something similar to a  combination capital investment and a management fee found in a hedge fund.\n\nHeres an Example: there is the Venture A who invests 110,000 and Venture B who invests 30,000. \"Entity A\" is the business and then there is the Founder of the business. (so theres two venture capitalist and the Founder does not have any capital to contribute. Founder fees is 6%. Investors fee is 2% of VC Contributed  / Expected VC. Expected VC is $150,000 (similarly you estimate how many stocks should be sold to collect the necessary capital) and these fees are not paid until the 5th business day of Year 2 so they are still payable in year 1)\nHeres how the balance sheet would work It's year 1 of operations:\n\nAssets:\n\nCash 100,000\n\nInventory: 10,000\n\nTotal Assets 110,000\n\nLiabilities:\n\nNotes Payable: 20,000\n\nAccrued Founders Fee: 14,486\n\nAccrued Payable to Venture A: 5,311\n\nAccrued Payable to Venture B: 1,449\n\nEquity:\n\nVenture A: 110,000\n\nVenture B: 30,000\n\nEntity A - Net losses over revenue: (71,246)\n\nTotal Equity and Liabs 110,000\n\nIncome Statement:\n\nRevenue: 200,000\n\nInventory used: 70,000\n\nOperating Expenses:  180,000\n\nFounder Fee: 14,486\n\nInvestor Fee: 6,760\n\nNet Loss: (71,246)\n\nCashflow\n\nBeginning Cash: 0\n\nNet Loss: (71,246)\n\nInventory: (10,000)\n\nVenture Capital: 140,0000\n\nNotes Payable: 20,000\n\nFounder Fee Payable: 14,486\n\nInvestor Fee Payable: 6,760\n\nNet Change in Cash: $100,000\n\nCash flows allows the investor fee and founder fee to be paid in full. If this wasn't the case a waterfall would have to be set up per the articles of \"corporation/organization\"\n\n\nSo heres the whats up:\n\nI'm essentially creating the regulations for this new type of company. And ultimately I would like to appeal to capitalists and socialists alike. I don't necessarily have to kill wall street but i would like to change the animal. Does Wall Street  have to be so volatile, and if net profits are stagnate does investors need to jump ship?\n\nI would like to give more pie to the workers but thus far, I've fallen short of how to solve this. I am definitely leaving more room for regulations to better solve this problem. Really I would like to allow the \"people\" to shape this new org through social media. Just as lobbyists get a chance get to influence our current laws. \n\nI have to agree with you. The capitalist system has worked. But will it continue to work in the best interest of the people? To me the benefits of capitalism, like net profit, is a bell curve. It was wonderful in the beginning. It built innovation, gave people motivation to create, to act  proactively in commerce and ultimately improve our societal structure.  But currently we are falling down the bell curve and in a period where corporations are finding solutions  to grow net profits that are not beneficial to society as a whole. Since they cannot allow for net profits to stagnate, they have begun to turn to unethical practices (i think you would agree without further explanation).  Long and short corporations are influencing regulations regardless of what is best for society as a whole. As an example I think corps are preventing new technologies that would diminish current product markets. For example corporations have spent a lot of $ on lobbyist to promote the use of oil even though there may be other viable energy solutions. Fuel efficient cars have struggled, even when ultimately the consumer doesn't care what type of energy they use as long as its affordable and works.\n\nAt the end of the day I would like  this new entity idea to solve 4 things\n\n1) I would like to promote technological advancement regardless of large corporate influence (and i have an idea on patent law as well. but that's another topic i guess)\n\n2) Change the hyperactive stock market to a more of a market with long term yields. \n\n3) Spread wealth  to the middle and lower classes through better wages\n\n4) Reduce the power of corporations. (I believe if we change the nature of wall street we can reduce the income gap and therefore corporate and even individual wealth and thus their power)\n\nI hope to get lots of minds involved in this project so we can solve this problem all together. The only reason I would like to limit certain \"communist\" or \"socialist\" regulations is so we can still keep the concept of \"the free market\" so the idea can actually be acceptable by most people. And I recognize this will be a challenge for everyone,,,, it does make solving the issues that much harder.\n\nBottom line I'm trying to rework the system so we all have a much better future. Right now I'm fearing that our democracy is just being eaten up by wealth and corporate power. And that looks like a pretty dark future to me. \n\nLet me know if you need more info, and what you would think it would take to \"sell\" someone on the idea. \n\nThanks so much, I appreciate it!", "edited": 1386464684, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdw7lsg", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386464227", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdvc8kt", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428362758, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdvdav0", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386367525", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdv90pf", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428363253, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Direct labor\u2026 how could I forget?

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt; The key here is that the \"Founder\" would not be allocated directly from net profit but gross profit. \n\nOK. I understand this (better).\n\n&gt; Therefore a corp would be less likely to refrain from wage increases. \n\nMaybe. Can we say that your objective is to share more of the profitable income with the workers?\n\n&gt; The difficult thing that this doesn't address is the fact that corporations like to keep profits, the typically don't just pass these profits a long to the worker. \n\nWell, all of the land/factory, the equipment, the training and early worker wages came out of a capital pool before profits were ever realized. Then profits happen. OK, so the capital pool has got to be paid back. Done. There will be future profits. Cool. Do we share those with the workers in the form of wage increases? Do we upgrade our computers and factories? Bigger offices? More workers? I'm not sure it is a simple matter of corporations want to \"sit on profits\" and \"not share\".\n\n\n&gt; So my \"sharing success\" may be a bit strong of a term. And yes. Wallstreet would be dead. \n\nHow? At the very least you still need the process of capital formation to build your new (for example) US$2B semi-conductor plant or whatever. Capital will expect to be paid back on their terms -- and will get it. I'm not seeing a dead wall-street here. I am seeing a conversion from a share-price-based compensation scheme and a profit-stream based compensation scheme. And the split between the founder and the workers changed. Otherwise, isn't it kind of business as usual?\n\n&gt; The problem with the current corporate structure is that initially corporations were created so a person could easily get cash to build their business without having to strictly pay back a loan If the business failed. \n\nSort of. It allowed for many investors to pool their resources to invest. It also created a single entity from the customer's, supplier's, employees and financiers point-of-view. Coordination problems are much reduced with the idea of a \"single entity\" doing a business.\n\n\n&gt; The problem is that today stock market has just become some sort of hyper-reactive machine that causes economic devastation when there's also physical devastation (war, famine, severe weather) . \n\nI don't know. My shares in back-up diesel generator companies do pretty well after a hurricane. I see your point, though.\n\n\n&gt; There must be a better way to get investors so a founder can have capital to start a business. (investors would have the same type of fee but at a smaller %). Any advice would be good. I'm still fleshing this idea out.\n\nSo, roughly, your objectives are:\n  - Share more with the employees\n  - Continue to reward the founder, but at a smaller level\n  - Kill Wallstreet ... for some reason having to do with assumptions about economic devastation connected coupled with physical devastation \n\nIs that about right?\n\nSo, briefly as I think about this: 1) What's wrong with stock-options for the employees? Simply that it doesn't \"kill\" wall-street? 2) If there is a new mode of capital formation, wouldn't it look like Wall-street? \n\n\n\n\n", "id": "t1_cdv1yq4", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "zArtLaffer", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "id": "t1_cdv6k8b", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sputnikbunny", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "selftext": "Under your scheme the labor cost component of COGS, which you are trying to minimize, would still be under pressure to be minimized.

In my world, it kind of goes like this:\n\n  - Founder and a couple of co-founders or friends work out a provisional bplan, financial model, pitch-deck and prototype (or at least demo) and maybe get a couple of LOIs from potential customer-types\n  - Customers get a killer-deal if they fund development of V1 just for them. Other-wise, angels+vc\n  - Build product. Sell product. Fix product. Sell some more.\n  - Need more dudes to expand in Asia ... more VC. Scale product.\n  - More VC. More dudes. More scale.

More approval cycles if you've got FDA approval (Insulin pumps). More debt capitalization if \"capital intensive\" (CapEx) ... like a regional telecom. More EPA stuff if you are building a new kind of 100MW electricity generator. But, grossly speaking, the same idea.\n\nIn this world, things already kind of work (from my point of view). I see angels+VCs+iBankers helping capitalize start-up and then growth companies. I see stock-options giving success-fees to *all* employees. I see the founder getting diluted by angel+vc and IPO or M&amp;A (or both), but not the employees. If the thing dies, everyone loses all of the time-imagination-energy that went into it. If the thing takes off, everyone wins.\n\nWhere is this so broken that we need to fix it?\n\nAre you really trying to fix just Walmart and McDonald's and the like?\n\nIf so, do you want to change the rules/environment for everyone, or just Walmart and Wall-street? If you are not trying to throw out the baby with the bathwater, how do you preserve the good parts of the system while \"punishing\" the bad men? Is it easier to do a one-size-fits-all for everyone and *hope* that a benevolent government run by people with the right-color shirts help until the team changes at half-time?\n\n", "id": "t1_cdvdav0", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "zArtLaffer", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "id": "t1_cdw7lsg", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sputnikbunny", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "selftext": "Thanks for your detailed work-through on the financials. And, to level-set this conversation, I was trying to understand (hence the questions) as opposed to proposing anything myself or debating you.\n\nThat last one, I might start doing (a very little) here by throwing up some alternative factoids or perspectives. And then, maybe we can get into what it would take to \"sell\" someone on the idea. Recognizing from the outset that you can't sell it to everyone in the ecosystem because any systemic shift from the status-quo will have winners and losers.\n\n&gt; Does Wall Street have to be so volatile\n\nWho knows? Even off Wall-street with have things like the Bitcoin exchanges. I'm guessing that you are talking about the publicly traded equity markets? If so, is the volatility or hype around things like Facebook or Twitter IPOs or Apple the fault of Wall-street or marketing hype and lemmings?\n\n&gt; But will is continue to work in the best interest of the people? \n\nYou seem to break this into three parts: Wall-street volatility, technological innovation coupled with corporatism (lobbyists pushing for regulations that limit competition and populism destroying strength of the corporation) and the wealth gap.\n\nFor the first, I'll let my last question stand.\n\nFor the second, I would take a longer lens. When Carnegie was building rail-roads, the water-ways people pushed back *hard* on that nonsense. It failed to ultimately succeed because of west-of-the-great-lakes we don't have options thing, and because of the Rockefeller thing but it was a real thing for over 30-40 years. Rockefeller: government broke him up. 20 years later, *each* of the baby-standards were larger than the original at the time of the break-up. IBM: by the time the government got around to curtailing them, technology had kind of \"gotten\" them. AT&amp;T: same thing. Microsoft: same thing. Government response to monopoly power is slow and reactive. In an evolving tech landscape, the new-new thing will kill the old-old guy ... even if they try to stop it. They can't.\n\nIs innovation dead? Don't know, but I see lots of nifty stuff I don't remember from 20 years ago (cheaply, at least): high-speed internet, wireless internet, (cheap) cell phones, GPS, Siri on iPhones, $200 laptops, DVRs, Netflix, ... there are more in industrial and less-consumer spaces like minimills for steel production and MRI machines. 3D printing. High density FPGAs (download your own open-source circuits!). Desktop genomics. mRNA arrays.\n\nI'm not seeing it. I see corporatism as pure corruption ... and not new. I see technological innovation as being alive and well. Volatility? Is it Wall-streets fault or the lemmings fault?\n\nAnd, wealth-gap ... I'm not seeing it. Maybe you make $100K/year. Or maybe you make $100B/year. If you don't make that $100B through corruption by selling me something that makes my life easier/better (like MS Office) for $100. My productivity improves 500% for $100? Sign-me up. I make more money. You earned my $100. And the simple fact that you have $100B doesn't really affect me. If it did, that is simple old-fashioned envy (or class-envy, which is usually populism) and not worthy of adult consideration.\n\nSo, I see poor people with cars, air-conditioning, laptops, high-speed internet, smart-phones and two flat-screen TVs, and I am reminded of words from my old Ethiopian cab driver: He wanted to come to America and see a country where poor people are fat.\n\nSo, I get your enthusiasm and wanting to solve \"big\" problems. I admire and applaud that. But ... I guess I'm having a tough time seeing the problem here.\n\nIf I were to \"attack\" a real-world problem (this is me), it probably would have to do something with unemployment, expensive health-care delivery, keeping the air clean BY finding clean ways to deliver electricity cheaply NOT by fools-errand mandated solutions (like Solar), higher-ed bubble: It is ridiculous that people graduate with $100K in debt for a degree in Hispanic-Transgendered studies and no ability to get a job. Any job. What is everyone thinking!?! That shit needs to stop.\n\nAnyway, that may have edged over into being preachy. Sorry. You probably ought to focus on the question part of this post! :-)\n\nLater, after I have noodled through cost/benefit of a structural change a bit, we can brain out a way to \"sell\" enough eco-system participants to get the sea-change you are looking for.\n\n", "id": "t1_cdw8cfe", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "zArtLaffer", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdwt461", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sputnikbunny", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdwt4zk", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sputnikbunny", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cdwt461", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428337840, "controversiality": 0, "body": "So the problems (and I very much agree) we should address\n\n1) unemployment\n\n2) healthcare \n\n3) cleaner air (so thats improving technology)\n\n4) education is waaaay over priced\n\nI also have to divulge into the cost/benefit of this new entity plan but i think this will be wrapped up in these explinations\n\n1) How to increase unemployment with this new entity structure:\n\tJobs have currently been under pressure. Companies are so large they have reached their max market share. Therefore in order for profits to not stagnate they have to reduce operating costs. This eventually means reducing the costs of wages. This squeezes two jobs into one. The new entity structure alleviates this because via taken direct labor and operating costs out of the equation, it also allows for returns for investors even when profits are stagnate. \n\n(I'm going to break into a rant. In what effing world would investments become unprofitable when there is a steady stream of profits (with no growth) Eff you wall street ! The way stocks work is against all logic! Good thing this can be repaired)\n\n2) Healthcare.\n\tHealthcare is a beast. Most drug companies and medical equip companies are private. And Health insurance companies are partnerships (wait\u2026 wait i don't know this for sure I'm just guessing from memory. And someone could school me on this statement). That would have to be dealt with by other laws and regulations. the only thing the new entity structure resolves is that corps wont want to cut these expenses. They may want to increase them. Why? less net profit equals less taxes. We could improve this through tax regulations though. \n\n3) Cleaner air Aka how can new technologies survive: \nYes I have a separate solution for how patents should be treated. So now i'll give you the details. Currently if your a patent holder you own a company that creates a product. And your the ONLY company that creates that product. Unless you sell your patent. Well Eff That! Lets change this. \n\nHeres the new solution:\nYour create a patent. You go through the govt and get that patent on the system (remember its public). Here's what happens next: Multiple companies likes your patent and want to build your product. All of these multiple companies gives you a \"Patent Fee.\" The fee is calc'ed as follows  (Revenues - inventory costs)/inventory costs * (revenues - inventory costs) * x%. Just like a founders fee.  Multiple companies will create a product at their own set price and the invisible hand of supply and demand and capitalism begins. Competition ensues, capitalism thrives and thrives even BETTER! \n\n4) Education is way too overpriced:\nHopefully taking the the stress out of operating costs will aid companies to pay more benefits to its workers, such as paid education and helping with student loans. The problem is educational institutions are currently non-profits. *This is important* This reduces my arguments potency because this new entity structure would act much like non-profits and we can look to non-profits like educational institutions to see what the results of this new organization may just be like. However Non-profits to do not give fees to investors so maybe this would calm the fever for wealth but this is speculation. Non profits are about legacy, meaning your name on the business inst. building. This is not something I would except my new entity to have a problem with. But who knows? I believe this is an weakness the needs to be addressed.\n\nWhats very interesting to me now is not only do i have to convince someone that the idea is good idea,  I may have to sway their heart about the current state of capitalism. I may have to give them reason to think that current corporate entity structure could be improved so more groups of people could succeed. Do you agree? \n\nWhat you think thus far :-)\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdwt4zk", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386534731", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Hmmm. A lot to think through and about. Made you busy typing on a Sunday! Sorry...\n\nThere is something in agent-based game-theoretic simulations that yield what they call evolutionarily stable strategies. To use one of the simple examples, there are a bunch of agents, each of them will have a strategy (which vary across the population) and they will meet each other and play a game of (say) prisoner's dilemma. Depending on their respective success, they reproduce or die. The population will then grow or shrink. And there will be (often) a couple of strategies that emerge in the population to be dominant. Maybe 1/3 of strategy A and 2/3 of strategy B.\n\nIf you end up with 100% of strategy A or 100% of strategy B, often the populations will shrink and die off.\n\nThere are different models, but the designers of the simulations are trying to see if (and how) altruism (for example) can evolve.\n\nIt's interesting to me studying different places (I have lived in the US, in eastern-europe, in Japan and visited over 3 dozen countries over the years) ... is that it is possible for everyone to be equally poor. It doesn't seem to be possible for everyone to be equally rich. But what is also interesting is that where there is income disparity, yes, there are winners and losers. But in *many* of the countries where it is possible to become rich through innovation or technical entrepreneurship (instead of pure feudal inheritance or friends-of-the-family corruption), when the \"pie\" gets bigger, the rich *do* get richer. But so do the poor. \n\nSo it comes down to a question of whether we want to all be equally poor, or allow some super-rich to emerge (like Bill Gates) because he enriches all of us ... and where the \"rich\" pay 70% of the income taxes in the US ... and enable the poor to be safer. Not because it is unfair, but because super-wealth enables us to be able to help our brother in that system?\n\n", "id": "t1_cdwu210", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "zArtLaffer", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "id": "t1_cdx3a70", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sputnikbunny", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "selftext": "&gt; I wonder if in this agent based model ideally we would want a mix so the majority would be a upper middle class. If A is rich, and B is poor we'd like a majority to be a mix of both AB. A mix were AB has a healthy amount of A and smaller amount of B? \n\nWell, the simulations that I am referring to have each individual have their own strategy. And then populations of strategies will emerge with different ratios. What is interesting to me is that a blended strategy system will end up with a systemic better total outcome. I used this in my side agent-based computational economics research, and you can do things like creating a \"computational theory of the firm\". And you end up with individuals creating firms (creation), growth, stagnation, decline, death as outcomes of the ecosystem of competing firms made up out of individuals.\n\n &gt; so many poor and few rich is because rich carries \n\nNot necessarily the reason, but it goes together. Both for income, savings, return on investment, entrepreneurial activity and effectiveness-of-any-human-action, you end up with a Pareto-like distribution. The 80/20 rule it is called in English. After an Italian economist/mathmetician a long time ago that noticed that regardless of the system, 20% of the people had 80% of the money (and vice-versa). This has been generalized by theorists and even a practitioner named Koch (no relation to the brothers, worked at BCG as an analyst and then an entrepreneural turn-around guy) that: 80% of results come from 20% of activities. Now, we can't predict from this theory *which* people will win or lose, but we can predict across time and space that this distribution is largely true.\n\n&gt; power because wealthier people have more access to information, access to consumer goods, access to technological advancements. \n\nWell, in that case, the poor in America and here on Reddit must be some of the most powerful people in the world!\n\n&gt; the poor were educated enough to come together and revolt\n\nWell, even the uneducated poor have revolted white violently in places like Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Korea and China. I don't know much about Europe, but I'm assuming that France and Russia were much the same?\n\nPeople who are angry enough to revolt are emotional. Emotional people are stupid and easily led by a charismatic leader. A leader who feeds that emotion to build his army. Once the leader has used them to 'win', he kills them. Useful idiots. Or dangerous competition. Either way: unnecessary after the revolution.\n\n&gt; Wall street's trickle down effect isn't working. \n\nWell, I don't think it is Wall-street's trickle down. But look at it this way: The rich don't put their money in mattresses or bury it in the back yard or put it in a big swimming pool like Scrooge McDuck. They either spend it (new car, pool, yacht, house, wife) or invest it (savings, low-yield/low-risk debt, higher(?)-yield/higher-risk equities, exotic trades and hedges, their own enterprise (LBO, etc.) or give it away (Ford Foundation, Bill&amp;Melinda Gates, Billionaire's pledge). Which of those does not directly or indirectly create jobs or help the poor?\n\nPut another way: If America isn't working out the way it is supposed to, the rich are fucked because they have no place to invest their money. For even selfish reasons. Even real-estate value assumes that there are other rich people out there. So the rich kind of need America to work -- even if it is only so that they can become more rich.\n\n", "id": "t1_cdxdngt", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "zArtLaffer", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdxqv0q", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sputnikbunny", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;  I think it\u2019s funny that the 80/20 rule works for wealth distribution\u2026 and natural phenomena\u2026 (Just read on Wikipedia). \n\nYeah ... zipf's law. And the small-world network people and the chaos people will tell you that 1/f distributions ('scale free') are a sign of self-organization. Order out of chaos. Which means *that* income distribution may well be a natural phenomena in a complex dynamic network system (the economy) as much as a stable ecosystem made of of populations of evolved creatures.\n\n&gt; On the topic of Wall street funding main street, in regards to hedge funds you won\u2019t believe. 100 plus million will be tied up in an investment for years\u2026. and how many people work in the back office? Usually 5-10. Maybe 20 if its billion plus firm \n\nWell, there are certainly outsized portfolios and returns per-person working at the fund. I agree with that. And the LPs are \"locked up\" for a while. I agree. The fund itself may move in and out of different positions more rapidly, though. Each \"hedge fund\" (which has over time become a fairly vague term) has a \"schtick\" or a \"trick\", an investment thesis, via which they generate their \"how we make our returns that beat the market\" story. Whatever. Do they help provide liquidity to the market at large? Maybe. I don't know. Does better market liquidity help main street? Maybe. I don't know. I can't argue for or against the modern form of hedge funds because I really don't know anything about them any more. They've changed too much since I did know something, and I haven't kept up. \n\nMy worry about main-street as intersects 'wall-street' is two-fold: Depository Financial Institutions (Consumer and merchant banks with checking and savings accounts) should not be able to use that DDA aggregate to collateralize market bets. Glass-stegal kind of got rid of that. Under Clinton (yes, with a Republican congress) we got rid of this for some reason. I don't know why we got rid of it, but it doesn't seem to have been positive. So, that's One. Number two is that when banks (these depository account asset banks) *should* be making their money doing \"loans\" to main-street. Yes, in current times they need to be careful (due-diligence). I get that. They aren't VC. But with essentially 0% interest rates, why would they lend *any* money. They essentially don't. Which is a problem for all of us ... because savings and loans is what they are supposed to do!\n\n&gt; It\u2019s true the rich may thrive on American wealth but let\u2019s not get too cozy about it. Our economic situation is not going to improve unless we do something about it.\n\nAgreed. So the question is to define the problem. What is one of the problems? Unemployment. Why? Labor not needed. Why? No (global) demand for American built products and services, at the price America can make/deliver them. Right? \n\nTell evil capitalists to hire more? To do what? There's no demand for American-built products. Why not? Expensive. Raise minimum wage? That makes it worse -- products more expensive. \"The rich should fix it\" -- well, they *do* fix their problem ... by exporting labor requirements to China and robots. Still leaves us with unemployment.\n\nSo, to solve unemployment, we need more demand for products/services. OK, --give-- everyone a job, those people will have demand? Well, sure -- they'll demand cheap products from China. American employer's will go bankrupt (no customers) and we are ... right back here.\n\nThen, what do we do about it? Well, let's break this down: why isn't America competitive with it's ability to build inexpensive consumer products? (Ignoring the fact that we are -- America is the largest manufacturing country in the world; we just don't need that many people to do it...)\n\nHint1: There is an answer to this core problem, if you break it down to its core elements.\n\nHint2: Having the government mandate prosperity has never in the history of the world ever worked.\n\nWe can chat about this later.

I think any new economic situation needs to account for some economic diversity. Interestingly 80/20 rule may be an ultimate goal? Where 20% may be more wealthy than the 80% but both should have a *better* quality of life. (Is this how this works?)\n\nHere is what I find a problem with the current buying and selling of corporate stock. Corporate sock is..... largely no longer a means to build capital to improve the company's product, its become a currency and the only expectation is to get some sort of quick ROI of 20% (that's HUGE). \n\nSmaller companies fear going public because of there is a lack of diversification for controlling interests, the company  loses their autonomy and is subject to the whims of their shareholders. I think there would be a lot of supporting evidence that the current corporate structure hurts small businesses. (I think this sort of research will be important in support for a new entity structure. Specifically to prove that technological advancements cannot easily come to fruition because seed capital must be obtained privately not publicly...I'll come back to this point)\n\nIn this economy I am under the assumption that \n\n1) There is a lack of jobs:\n\nCompanies (as previously discussed) have squeezed two jobs into one and have been increasingly pushing for productivity.\n\n2) American products are needed, we just have to change the products:\n\nThere are technological advancements every day! We could be building hover boards (heh)! But do we allow for new small business to really thrive. Is these products too expensive to build. &lt;---- and this is where I think the real problem is. The cost of todays goods are just too costly. You would need large sums of capital, but there's a problem.... banks are not loaning. Plus going public means losing autonomy of your business. \n\n&gt;Then, what do we do about it? Well, let's break this down: why isn't America competitive with it's ability to build inexpensive consumer products? (Ignoring the fact that we are -- America is the largest manufacturing country in the world; we just don't need that many people to do it...)&lt;\n\nYes this is key! I think its very important to do an analysis of why the costs of goods are rising. *If and it is what I suspect it is* It's the demand for ROI. I will have to do further research.  (But its the pressure that stock only increases if there is growth of net profit year after year.. which I've state before since NP is on a bell curve this is a huge problem. And therefore the price will artificially inflate)\n\nIf I have explained myself well, I'm going to bring this full circle\n\nIf the Top 1% wanted to simulate into a new 80/20 model wouldn't they just have to directly contribute capital to these small businesses? And it looks to me they have a lot of capital to contribute. Take their corporate stocks away and give these 1%ters a new investment opportunity. \"Investors Fees\" \n\nSo here is the unknown:\n\nDo you think it's possible if we dissolved corporate stocks and in turn asked the 1% to invest in these investors fees- Would capital flow more freely? Let's stop trading stocks like a currency and actually create new capital.\n\nSide Note:\nYes, because glass-steagall act's clock ran out ... and because of Alan Greenspan's human optimism, there went the housing crash.  Alan Greenspan turned a blind eye to the interest only loans knowing that they would default largely because of his confidence that banks wouldn't take any actions that would allow for the banks to collapse. He assumed banks would not intentionally hurt their own business....then we learned the terms \"too big to fail\". Sadly we all put faith in \"experts\" but really, experts are only good guessers. \n\nIt's great talking to you too! I think I may like to peruse this idea further and write a more detailed report.

Sorry!\n\nYes, this only attacks publicly traded stocks put on the market. All publicly traded stocks are byproducts of corporations. These include IPOs. And since the full plan is to transition ALL CORPS to this new structure, publicly traded stocks would be extinct.\n\n There are other forms of publicly traded equity. These would be publicly traded private equity funds (\"PEFs\"). These are Partnerships that combine LP interests in various other partnerships. Investors in PEFs will receive performance fees based on hurdle rates and income for the lower tiered partnerships. Essentially this falls under the same SEC rules as hedge funds.  What I like about PEF's (and I'm willing to leave these alone) is that they are not trading partnership interests daily or even hourly. Why? SEC Laws already state you need to have wealth of $1 million plus to be an investor. That is because investing is so risky. Good returns on PEF's take years of 5-10. So that would be a long term investment. The other benefits of PEFs is that SEC is very specific about how these funds are trading and are overseeing these very well in my opinion.  Note these SEC regulations do not come into play when you just buy a share of stock in a corporation.  Plus today if you want to be a little guy and invest in PEF you would have to buy publicly traded shares of a corp that invests in PEFs\u2026 well corps would be erased in this plan. So there goes that and PEF's after axing corps would still be under the SEC rules. Truth be told if you have the wealth to invest in PEFs, sure you can make great returns but you can also fail miserably! So I say let the rich keep taking these risks\u2026. it's like specialized gambling in my opinion, from my experience most don't do well. Its just a long term game of craps. \n\nOkay so here are opposing argument to your response. I'm going to boil these down. Hopefully I have fully grasp what your saying.\n\n1) Technological advancements cannot be stopped\u2026. and at the end of the day they will become successful.  And specifically we're talking advancements that change the status quo.\n\nA. Ah but we are only looking at success stories. There is a very full possibility that corps can swallow up good ideas. This is done  first when a person creates a patent. The creator of this patent probably has one of two choices. The can receive seed money from investors. Or they can sell their patent to the highest bidder. Unfortunately if the highest bidder is one of the largest corps in the world how could any amount of seed money compete? There is also speculation that these corps could instill fear, by threatening lawsuits which may make the uneducated submit to a patent sale. Its speculation but it certainly happens. Ack! I really don't want to get into specifics examples on a sunday. lol. \n\n2) Motivation could change everything\n\nA Yes. But this motivated person would have to have two qualities and be a lucky contender (if the situation above happened). For one they would have to be intelligent enough to create a patent. Secondly they would have to shun corporate money and take the lessor seed money. They may decide this for fame or creative control. But what if they just wanted to be rich? What if they were not philosophers and are just byproducts of out shitty college education system that focuses on learning trades and not expanding minds to such crazy things as philosophy. (kay so my hobby is philosophy and we philosophers got a lot of problems with today's world). Thirdly they would have to find seed money! Easier said than done! \u2026. Are we going to wait for this chanve to be fulfilled until we can get some decent technological innovation the opposes the status quo? Why not just facilitate the system so these technological advancements can happen a lot easier. \n\n3) What happens to the prices of our products??  Hey, we all like products, they allow us to be more profitable.\n\nThis idea works with capitalism. Yup, the only thing thats being changed is how you  culminate investors and please \"founders\". All the economic laws of capitalism still apply.\n\n4) Wealth gap? What wealth gap? (this may be a sideline topic to this discussion but I love talking about this!) \n\nWell the wealth gap is more clear for me to see for one simple reason. I'm at the high end of the wealth gap but my parents are at the bottom end. Mom works 50 plus hours and dad is full time worker who has a very physical job. He's getting older and each day the job is harder and harder for him to do. They always were at the min wage level so they only got enough $ together to buy a modest condo in their late 40s. And that is because they became blindsided about the growing cost of living. As a result they have to put in a lot of blood and sweat but don't have much to show for it (understandably this is relative but i believe advance civilizations should bring quality of life up\u2026 not create more of a struggle against the successful top)\n\nSo it's not class envy for me\u2026 this will be the hardest thing to explain but let me try. It's years of reading philosophy and translating it to not just sentiments but mathematics. (and I'm not lying this took years of learning!) But I will boil it down to how i went from a business mind to a belief in a sort of caring that should be extended to every human being.\n\nInherently our social structure today has very strong ideas that a person must 1) work hard to get to the top 2) a person is in the hands of their own destiny 3) unsuccessful persons is due to laziness or a sort of darwinian result of our nature.\n\nPhilosophy argues:\n\n1) the inherent structure of this system (that is capitalism) forces failure:\nheres the long a short of it wrapped in a neat metaphor.. and i just thought of this metaphor so here we go (lol!): You want plants in your garden to grow. You have one garden where you nourish the plants with enriched soil and the second garden you just throw seeds on the ground and see what happens. Throwing seeds in the ground does not give nearly as good results. Actually the tossed seeds do terribly. The tossed seeds translates to the poorer kids. #1 the education system in the citys they live in is shoty, #2 kids in poorer families have to deal with physical and mental anxieties such as inadequate food, abuse and lack of parental guidance since both parents must work. #3 Since these kids feel like they cannot be apart of society they become apart of something else; gangs, which leeds to crime.\n\nSo\u2026.kids in enriched soil, these are the kids living in towns with their is  wealth. Towns revenue increases from property taxes  and those towns can provide a better education. Also kids of the Middle class/wealthy come from fewer broken homes. Ect. and we'll move on\u2026 I think thats enough.\n\n2) The system only allows people with skills that can be used on the job to flourish, while others are forced to struggle:\n\nWhy should we allow some people to fail. Do they deserve to fail because of our darwinian structure? Many people can easily say \"sure\" there will be failures. But lets go here: We have a unconditional request of one another.  You may not feel it because we are so closed off from each individual person but it exists. We all request love, help, acceptance and even respect from one another. When we improve society so we can be more moral and accepting of one another we become happier people. Not only do you benefit from the good feelings but others benefit. I say lets make this societally less darwinian. And the argument that humans are humans and need to conquer over the failed\u2026 well i say neigh! We have much more heart. \n\nI can go into a full explanations if you are interested, I'd have to point you to some essays I could probably find online  but I just wanted a over simplified idea for now (just to see if it works). But I'll be happy to divulge further if necessary.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdwt461", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386534685", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdw7lsg", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428347663, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdw8cfe", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386466033", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdvdav0", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428348008, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sorry I'm just getting back!\nI agree with your business model. The new structure would turn VC into something similar to a  combination capital investment and a management fee found in a hedge fund.\n\nHeres an Example: there is the Venture A who invests 110,000 and Venture B who invests 30,000. \"Entity A\" is the business and then there is the Founder of the business. (so theres two venture capitalist and the Founder does not have any capital to contribute. Founder fees is 6%. Investors fee is 2% of VC Contributed  / Expected VC. Expected VC is $150,000 (similarly you estimate how many stocks should be sold to collect the necessary capital) and these fees are not paid until the 5th business day of Year 2 so they are still payable in year 1)\nHeres how the balance sheet would work It's year 1 of operations:\n\nAssets:\n\nCash 100,000\n\nInventory: 10,000\n\nTotal Assets 110,000\n\nLiabilities:\n\nNotes Payable: 20,000\n\nAccrued Founders Fee: 14,486\n\nAccrued Payable to Venture A: 5,311\n\nAccrued Payable to Venture B: 1,449\n\nEquity:\n\nVenture A: 110,000\n\nVenture B: 30,000\n\nEntity A - Net losses over revenue: (71,246)\n\nTotal Equity and Liabs 110,000\n\nIncome Statement:\n\nRevenue: 200,000\n\nInventory used: 70,000\n\nOperating Expenses:  180,000\n\nFounder Fee: 14,486\n\nInvestor Fee: 6,760\n\nNet Loss: (71,246)\n\nCashflow\n\nBeginning Cash: 0\n\nNet Loss: (71,246)\n\nInventory: (10,000)\n\nVenture Capital: 140,0000\n\nNotes Payable: 20,000\n\nFounder Fee Payable: 14,486\n\nInvestor Fee Payable: 6,760\n\nNet Change in Cash: $100,000\n\nCash flows allows the investor fee and founder fee to be paid in full. If this wasn't the case a waterfall would have to be set up per the articles of \"corporation/organization\"\n\n\nSo heres the whats up:\n\nI'm essentially creating the regulations for this new type of company. And ultimately I would like to appeal to capitalists and socialists alike. I don't necessarily have to kill wall street but i would like to change the animal. Does Wall Street  have to be so volatile, and if net profits are stagnate does investors need to jump ship?\n\nI would like to give more pie to the workers but thus far, I've fallen short of how to solve this. I am definitely leaving more room for regulations to better solve this problem. Really I would like to allow the \"people\" to shape this new org through social media. Just as lobbyists get a chance get to influence our current laws. \n\nI have to agree with you. The capitalist system has worked. But will it continue to work in the best interest of the people? To me the benefits of capitalism, like net profit, is a bell curve. It was wonderful in the beginning. It built innovation, gave people motivation to create, to act  proactively in commerce and ultimately improve our societal structure.  But currently we are falling down the bell curve and in a period where corporations are finding solutions  to grow net profits that are not beneficial to society as a whole. Since they cannot allow for net profits to stagnate, they have begun to turn to unethical practices (i think you would agree without further explanation).  Long and short corporations are influencing regulations regardless of what is best for society as a whole. As an example I think corps are preventing new technologies that would diminish current product markets. For example corporations have spent a lot of $ on lobbyist to promote the use of oil even though there may be other viable energy solutions. Fuel efficient cars have struggled, even when ultimately the consumer doesn't care what type of energy they use as long as its affordable and works.\n\nAt the end of the day I would like  this new entity idea to solve 4 things\n\n1) I would like to promote technological advancement regardless of large corporate influence (and i have an idea on patent law as well. but that's another topic i guess)\n\n2) Change the hyperactive stock market to a more of a market with long term yields. \n\n3) Spread wealth  to the middle and lower classes through better wages\n\n4) Reduce the power of corporations. (I believe if we change the nature of wall street we can reduce the income gap and therefore corporate and even individual wealth and thus their power)\n\nI hope to get lots of minds involved in this project so we can solve this problem all together. The only reason I would like to limit certain \"communist\" or \"socialist\" regulations is so we can still keep the concept of \"the free market\" so the idea can actually be acceptable by most people. And I recognize this will be a challenge for everyone,,,, it does make solving the issues that much harder.\n\nBottom line I'm trying to rework the system so we all have a much better future. Right now I'm fearing that our democracy is just being eaten up by wealth and corporate power. And that looks like a pretty dark future to me. \n\nLet me know if you need more info, and what you would think it would take to \"sell\" someone on the idea. \n\nThanks so much, I appreciate it!", "edited": 1386464684, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdw7lsg", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386464227", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdvc8kt", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428362758, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdvdav0", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386367525", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdv90pf", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428363253, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Direct labor\u2026 how could I forget?

I like what you\u2019re saying\n\nOkay, Yes let's say this new corporate structure has the potential to help share more of the profitable income with workers. \n\nYour right profits are spent based on many factors. Usually it\u2019s about which will benefit the company the most; A second plant\u2026 Bigger offices\u2026 What's been noticeable is the increase in officer's salaries. I'm not sure why this is so? It seems to be some sort of market trend where the best CEO's expect an astronomical wage and then blue collar wages increases are off the table. (? Maybe this could be rectified by tax incentives to increase wages. Give  % increase get a % tax break?).\n\nYour right, maybe not so much \"Wall Street would be dead\" as the stock market would be dead.  Dissolve the current corporate structure and there would not be any public shares to trade on the stock market. Wall street could still function by trading \u201cInvestor Fees\u201d and investor fees would work much like a dividend, yes. But there will be a huge change in how Wall Street would function:\n\nA transition from a share-price-based compensation scheme to a profit-stream based compensation scheme would have some drastic economic effects! \n\nThe current share-price-based compensation system is driven by return on investment where the return is net profit. Most business\u2019s net profit acts like a bell curve. The business grows as it reaches new customers but then it peaks when it reaches its max market share and then profits either become stagnate or decline. Once Net profits stagnate share prices fall; this is because shareholders no longer want to hold onto the stock because the stock has reached its max selling, in turn they sell thier shares, saturating the market , dropping the prices. So business have to start to eat away at operating costs in order to keep their ROI growing and the share prices up. And ultimately that\u2019s how two jobs becomes one, more stress on the workers but no pay increases. \n\nSo let\u2019s take a look at the repercussions of this new entity structure with founders fees (=fraction where the Numerator would be the gross profit and the denominator would be cost of goods sold. Then multiplied by the gross profit times X%). Compared to net profits, gross profits are fairly steady depending on the materials used. If the COGS is less than the multiplier for your Founders fees increases. These new businesses will still have incentives to keep COGS low. There will also be an incentive for your product to reach more of a market share. But what\u2019s lovely is when market share peaks, you still get a founders fee. Your investment is not devalued. Capitalism\u2019s principles of the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d will still come into play here. So I wouldn\u2019t expect to have any adverse effects to inflate price of a product to get a better Founders fee.\n\nI think your right we should keep the separate legal entity structure. I think this is key and effective piece of the current system we have now. We don\u2019t want the founder to be liable if the entity is sued. \n", "edited": 1386353523, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdv6k8b", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386353317", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdv1mdq", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428368200, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdv1yq4", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386343065", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}

Can we say that your objective is to share more of the profitable income with the workers?\n\n&gt; The difficult thing that this doesn't address is the fact that corporations like to keep profits, the typically don't just pass these profits a long to the worker. \n\nWell, all of the land/factory, the equipment, the training and early worker wages came out of a capital pool before profits were ever realized. Then profits happen. OK, so the capital pool has got to be paid back. Done. There will be future profits. Cool. Do we share those with the workers in the form of wage increases? Do we upgrade our computers and factories? Bigger offices? More workers? I'm not sure it is a simple matter of corporations want to \"sit on profits\" and \"not share\".\n\n\n&gt; So my \"sharing success\" may be a bit strong of a term. And yes. Wallstreet would be dead. \n\nHow? At the very least you still need the process of capital formation to build your new (for example) US$2B semi-conductor plant or whatever. Capital will expect to be paid back on their terms -- and will get it. I'm not seeing a dead wall-street here. I am seeing a conversion from a share-price-based compensation scheme and a profit-stream based compensation scheme. And the split between the founder and the workers changed. Otherwise, isn't it kind of business as usual?\n\n&gt; The problem with the current corporate structure is that initially corporations were created so a person could easily get cash to build their business without having to strictly pay back a loan If the business failed. \n\nSort of. It allowed for many investors to pool their resources to invest. It also created a single entity from the customer's, supplier's, employees and financiers point-of-view. Coordination problems are much reduced with the idea of a \"single entity\" doing a business.\n\n\n&gt; The problem is that today stock market has just become some sort of hyper-reactive machine that causes economic devastation when there's also physical devastation (war, famine, severe weather) . \n\nI don't know. My shares in back-up diesel generator companies do pretty well after a hurricane. I see your point, though.\n\n\n&gt; There must be a better way to get investors so a founder can have capital to start a business. (investors would have the same type of fee but at a smaller %). Any advice would be good. I'm still fleshing this idea out.\n\nSo, roughly, your objectives are:\n  - Share more with the employees\n  - Continue to reward the founder, but at a smaller level\n  - Kill Wallstreet ... for some reason having to do with assumptions about economic devastation connected coupled with physical devastation \n\nIs that about right?\n\nSo, briefly as I think about this: 1) What's wrong with stock-options for the employees? Simply that it doesn't \"kill\" wall-street? 2) If there is a new mode of capital formation, wouldn't it look like Wall-street? \n\n\n\n\n", "id": "t1_cdv1yq4", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "zArtLaffer", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "id": "t1_cdv6k8b", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sputnikbunny", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "selftext": "Under your scheme the labor cost component of COGS, which you are trying to minimize, would still be under pressure to be minimized.

This is simple enough to understand.\n\nOK, name-calling aside (you commie!) ... I'm always (myself) going back to a clear definition of the problem. What are we trying to fix? Here, it seems that you have some vague feeling(s) that:\n\n  - Founders have too much equity, but need something \"fair\"\n\n  - CEOs and founders may not be the same. And CEOs are paid too much today\n\n  - Workers aren't paid enough, and this isn't fair\n\n  - Wall-street is rapacious and equity markets in particular need to be dismantled/destroyed\n\nI'm assuming that you are in the US if you are afraid to be labeled a \"commie\". Your proposal is intended to:\n\n  - Incentivize the founder \"fairly\"\n\n  - More \"pie\" for the workers\n\n  - Somehow (haven't seen how) minimize executive pay\n\n  - Kill Wall-street because they suck (or something)\n\n  - More room for regulations in this structure. (I'm not seeing \"how\" on this part; and not knowing \"what\" kind of regulation you are trying to create room for ... no comment)\n\nI'm sorry if I keep missing the thread or back-tracking -- maybe it's the industries that I've been exposed to. In my world, it kind of goes like this:\n\n  - Founder and a couple of co-founders or friends work out a provisional bplan, financial model, pitch-deck and prototype (or at least demo) and maybe get a couple of LOIs from potential customer-types\n  - Customers get a killer-deal if they fund development of V1 just for them. Other-wise, angels+vc\n  - Build product. Sell product. Fix product. Sell some more.\n  - Need more dudes to expand in Asia ... more VC. Scale product.\n  - More VC. More dudes. More scale. More products? \n  - Mezzanine --&gt; M&amp;A. OR\n  - Go public. (This was more common pre-Sarbanes-Oxeley) \n\nNow, there may be some futzing around with factories and suppliers and vendors here if you are making physical equipment (like Cisco). More approval cycles if you've got FDA approval (Insulin pumps). More debt capitalization if \"capital intensive\" (CapEx) ... like a regional telecom. More EPA stuff if you are building a new kind of 100MW electricity generator. But, grossly speaking, the same idea.\n\nIn this world, things already kind of work (from my point of view). I see angels+VCs+iBankers helping capitalize start-up and then growth companies. I see stock-options giving success-fees to *all* employees. I see the founder getting diluted by angel+vc and IPO or M&amp;A (or both), but not the employees. If the thing dies, everyone loses all of the time-imagination-energy that went into it. If the thing takes off, everyone wins.\n\nWhere is this so broken that we need to fix it?\n\nAre you really trying to fix just Walmart and McDonald's and the like?\n\nIf so, do you want to change the rules/environment for everyone, or just Walmart and Wall-street? If you are not trying to throw out the baby with the bathwater, how do you preserve the good parts of the system while \"punishing\" the bad men? Is it easier to do a one-size-fits-all for everyone and *hope* that a benevolent government run by people with the right-color shirts help until the team changes at half-time?\n\n", "id": "t1_cdvdav0", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "zArtLaffer", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "id": "t1_cdw7lsg", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sputnikbunny", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "selftext": "Thanks for your detailed work-through on the financials. And, to level-set this conversation, I was trying to understand (hence the questions) as opposed to proposing anything myself or debating you.\n\nThat last one, I might start doing (a very little) here by throwing up some alternative factoids or perspectives. And then, maybe we can get into what it would take to \"sell\" someone on the idea. Recognizing from the outset that you can't sell it to everyone in the ecosystem because any systemic shift from the status-quo will have winners and losers.\n\n&gt; Does Wall Street have to be so volatile\n\nWho knows? Even off Wall-street with have things like the Bitcoin exchanges. I'm guessing that you are talking about the publicly traded equity markets? If so, is the volatility or hype around things like Facebook or Twitter IPOs or Apple the fault of Wall-street or marketing hype and lemmings?\n\n&gt; But will is continue to work in the best interest of the people? \n\nYou seem to break this into three parts: Wall-street volatility, technological innovation coupled with corporatism (lobbyists pushing for regulations that limit competition and populism destroying strength of the corporation) and the wealth gap.\n\nFor the first, I'll let my last question stand.\n\nFor the second, I would take a longer lens. When Carnegie was building rail-roads, the water-ways people pushed back *hard* on that nonsense. It failed to ultimately succeed because of west-of-the-great-lakes we don't have options thing, and because of the Rockefeller thing but it was a real thing for over 30-40 years. Rockefeller: government broke him up. 20 years later, *each* of the baby-standards were larger than the original at the time of the break-up. IBM: by the time the government got around to curtailing them, technology had kind of \"gotten\" them. AT&amp;T: same thing. Microsoft: same thing. Government response to monopoly power is slow and reactive. In an evolving tech landscape, the new-new thing will kill the old-old guy ... even if they try to stop it. They can't.\n\nIs innovation dead? Don't know, but I see lots of nifty stuff I don't remember from 20 years ago (cheaply, at least): high-speed internet, wireless internet, (cheap) cell phones, GPS, Siri on iPhones, $200 laptops, DVRs, Netflix, ... there are more in industrial and less-consumer spaces like minimills for steel production and MRI machines. 3D printing. High density FPGAs (download your own open-source circuits!). Desktop genomics. mRNA arrays.\n\nI'm not seeing it. I see corporatism as pure corruption ... and not new. I see technological innovation as being alive and well. Volatility? Is it Wall-streets fault or the lemmings fault?\n\nAnd, wealth-gap ... I'm not seeing it. Maybe you make $100K/year. Or maybe you make $100B/year. If you don't make that $100B through corruption by selling me something that makes my life easier/better (like MS Office) for $100. My productivity improves 500% for $100? Sign-me up. I make more money. You earned my $100. And the simple fact that you have $100B doesn't really affect me. If it did, that is simple old-fashioned envy (or class-envy, which is usually populism) and not worthy of adult consideration.\n\nSo, I see poor people with cars, air-conditioning, laptops, high-speed internet, smart-phones and two flat-screen TVs, and I am reminded of words from my old Ethiopian cab driver: He wanted to come to America and see a country where poor people are fat.\n\nSo, I get your enthusiasm and wanting to solve \"big\" problems. I admire and applaud that. But ... I guess I'm having a tough time seeing the problem here.\n\nIf I were to \"attack\" a real-world problem (this is me), it probably would have to do something with unemployment, expensive health-care delivery, keeping the air clean BY finding clean ways to deliver electricity cheaply NOT by fools-errand mandated solutions (like Solar), higher-ed bubble: It is ridiculous that people graduate with $100K in debt for a degree in Hispanic-Transgendered studies and no ability to get a job. Any job. What is everyone thinking!?! That shit needs to stop.\n\nAnyway, that may have edged over into being preachy. Sorry. You probably ought to focus on the question part of this post! :-)\n\nLater, after I have noodled through cost/benefit of a structural change a bit, we can brain out a way to \"sell\" enough eco-system participants to get the sea-change you are looking for.\n\n", "id": "t1_cdw8cfe", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "zArtLaffer", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdwt461", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sputnikbunny", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdwt4zk", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sputnikbunny", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cdwt461", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428337840, "controversiality": 0, "body": "So the problems (and I very much agree) we should address\n\n1) unemployment\n\n2) healthcare \n\n3) cleaner air (so thats improving technology)\n\n4) education is waaaay over priced\n\nI also have to divulge into the cost/benefit of this new entity plan but i think this will be wrapped up in these explinations\n\n1) How to increase unemployment with this new entity structure:\n\tJobs have currently been under pressure. Companies are so large they have reached their max market share. Therefore in order for profits to not stagnate they have to reduce operating costs. This eventually means reducing the costs of wages. This squeezes two jobs into one. The new entity structure alleviates this because via taken direct labor and operating costs out of the equation, it also allows for returns for investors even when profits are stagnate. \n\n(I'm going to break into a rant. In what effing world would investments become unprofitable when there is a steady stream of profits (with no growth) Eff you wall street ! The way stocks work is against all logic! Good thing this can be repaired)\n\n2) Healthcare.\n\tHealthcare is a beast. Most drug companies and medical equip companies are private. And Health insurance companies are partnerships (wait\u2026 wait i don't know this for sure I'm just guessing from memory. And someone could school me on this statement). That would have to be dealt with by other laws and regulations. the only thing the new entity structure resolves is that corps wont want to cut these expenses. They may want to increase them. Why? less net profit equals less taxes. We could improve this through tax regulations though. \n\n3) Cleaner air Aka how can new technologies survive: \nYes I have a separate solution for how patents should be treated. So now i'll give you the details. Currently if your a patent holder you own a company that creates a product. And your the ONLY company that creates that product. Unless you sell your patent. Well Eff That! Lets change this. \n\nHeres the new solution:\nYour create a patent. You go through the govt and get that patent on the system (remember its public). Here's what happens next: Multiple companies likes your patent and want to build your product. All of these multiple companies gives you a \"Patent Fee.\" The fee is calc'ed as follows  (Revenues - inventory costs)/inventory costs * (revenues - inventory costs) * x%. Just like a founders fee.  Multiple companies will create a product at their own set price and the invisible hand of supply and demand and capitalism begins. Competition ensues, capitalism thrives and thrives even BETTER! \n\n4) Education is way too overpriced:\nHopefully taking the the stress out of operating costs will aid companies to pay more benefits to its workers, such as paid education and helping with student loans. The problem is educational institutions are currently non-profits. *This is important* This reduces my arguments potency because this new entity structure would act much like non-profits and we can look to non-profits like educational institutions to see what the results of this new organization may just be like. However Non-profits to do not give fees to investors so maybe this would calm the fever for wealth but this is speculation. Non profits are about legacy, meaning your name on the business inst. building. This is not something I would except my new entity to have a problem with. But who knows? I believe this is an weakness the needs to be addressed.\n\nWhats very interesting to me now is not only do i have to convince someone that the idea is good idea,  I may have to sway their heart about the current state of capitalism. I may have to give them reason to think that current corporate entity structure could be improved so more groups of people could succeed. Do you agree? \n\nWhat you think thus far :-)\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdwt4zk", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386534731", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Hmmm. A lot to think through and about. Made you busy typing on a Sunday! Sorry...\n\nThere is something in agent-based game-theoretic simulations that yield what they call evolutionarily stable strategies. To use one of the simple examples, there are a bunch of agents, each of them will have a strategy (which vary across the population) and they will meet each other and play a game of (say) prisoner's dilemma. Depending on their respective success, they reproduce or die. The population will then grow or shrink. And there will be (often) a couple of strategies that emerge in the population to be dominant. Maybe 1/3 of strategy A and 2/3 of strategy B.\n\nIf you end up with 100% of strategy A or 100% of strategy B, often the populations will shrink and die off.\n\nThere are different models, but the designers of the simulations are trying to see if (and how) altruism (for example) can evolve.\n\nIt's interesting to me studying different places (I have lived in the US, in eastern-europe, in Japan and visited over 3 dozen countries over the years) ... is that it is possible for everyone to be equally poor. It doesn't seem to be possible for everyone to be equally rich. But what is also interesting is that where there is income disparity, yes, there are winners and losers. But in *many* of the countries where it is possible to become rich through innovation or technical entrepreneurship (instead of pure feudal inheritance or friends-of-the-family corruption), when the \"pie\" gets bigger, the rich *do* get richer. But so do the poor. \n\nSo it comes down to a question of whether we want to all be equally poor, or allow some super-rich to emerge (like Bill Gates) because he enriches all of us ... and where the \"rich\" pay 70% of the income taxes in the US ... and enable the poor to be safer. Not because it is unfair, but because super-wealth enables us to be able to help our brother in that system?\n\n", "id": "t1_cdwu210", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "zArtLaffer", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "id": "t1_cdx3a70", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sputnikbunny", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "selftext": "&gt; I wonder if in this agent based model ideally we would want a mix so the majority would be a upper middle class. If A is rich, and B is poor we'd like a majority to be a mix of both AB. A mix were AB has a healthy amount of A and smaller amount of B? \n\nWell, the simulations that I am referring to have each individual have their own strategy. And then populations of strategies will emerge with different ratios. What is interesting to me is that a blended strategy system will end up with a systemic better total outcome. I used this in my side agent-based computational economics research, and you can do things like creating a \"computational theory of the firm\". And you end up with individuals creating firms (creation), growth, stagnation, decline, death as outcomes of the ecosystem of competing firms made up out of individuals.\n\n &gt; so many poor and few rich is because rich carries \n\nNot necessarily the reason, but it goes together. Both for income, savings, return on investment, entrepreneurial activity and effectiveness-of-any-human-action, you end up with a Pareto-like distribution. The 80/20 rule it is called in English. After an Italian economist/mathmetician a long time ago that noticed that regardless of the system, 20% of the people had 80% of the money (and vice-versa). This has been generalized by theorists and even a practitioner named Koch (no relation to the brothers, worked at BCG as an analyst and then an entrepreneural turn-around guy) that: 80% of results come from 20% of activities. Now, we can't predict from this theory *which* people will win or lose, but we can predict across time and space that this distribution is largely true.\n\n&gt; power because wealthier people have more access to information, access to consumer goods, access to technological advancements. \n\nWell, in that case, the poor in America and here on Reddit must be some of the most powerful people in the world!\n\n&gt; the poor were educated enough to come together and revolt\n\nWell, even the uneducated poor have revolted white violently in places like Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Korea and China. I don't know much about Europe, but I'm assuming that France and Russia were much the same?\n\nPeople who are angry enough to revolt are emotional. Emotional people are stupid and easily led by a charismatic leader. A leader who feeds that emotion to build his army. Once the leader has used them to 'win', he kills them. Useful idiots. Or dangerous competition. Either way: unnecessary after the revolution.\n\n&gt; Wall street's trickle down effect isn't working. \n\nWell, I don't think it is Wall-street's trickle down. But look at it this way: The rich don't put their money in mattresses or bury it in the back yard or put it in a big swimming pool like Scrooge McDuck. They either spend it (new car, pool, yacht, house, wife) or invest it (savings, low-yield/low-risk debt, higher(?)-yield/higher-risk equities, exotic trades and hedges, their own enterprise (LBO, etc.) or give it away (Ford Foundation, Bill&amp;Melinda Gates, Billionaire's pledge). Which of those does not directly or indirectly create jobs or help the poor?\n\nPut another way: If America isn't working out the way it is supposed to, the rich are fucked because they have no place to invest their money. For even selfish reasons. Even real-estate value assumes that there are other rich people out there. So the rich kind of need America to work -- even if it is only so that they can become more rich.\n\n", "id": "t1_cdxdngt", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "zArtLaffer", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cdxqv0q", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sputnikbunny", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;  I think it\u2019s funny that the 80/20 rule works for wealth distribution\u2026 and natural phenomena\u2026 (Just read on Wikipedia). \n\nYeah ... zipf's law. And the small-world network people and the chaos people will tell you that 1/f distributions ('scale free') are a sign of self-organization. Order out of chaos. Which means *that* income distribution may well be a natural phenomena in a complex dynamic network system (the economy) as much as a stable ecosystem made of of populations of evolved creatures.\n\n&gt; On the topic of Wall street funding main street, in regards to hedge funds you won\u2019t believe. 100 plus million will be tied up in an investment for years\u2026. and how many people work in the back office? Usually 5-10. Maybe 20 if its billion plus firm \n\nWell, there are certainly outsized portfolios and returns per-person working at the fund. I agree with that. And the LPs are \"locked up\" for a while. I agree. The fund itself may move in and out of different positions more rapidly, though. Each \"hedge fund\" (which has over time become a fairly vague term) has a \"schtick\" or a \"trick\", an investment thesis, via which they generate their \"how we make our returns that beat the market\" story. Whatever. Do they help provide liquidity to the market at large? Maybe. I don't know. Does better market liquidity help main street? Maybe. I don't know. I can't argue for or against the modern form of hedge funds because I really don't know anything about them any more. They've changed too much since I did know something, and I haven't kept up. \n\nMy worry about main-street as intersects 'wall-street' is two-fold: Depository Financial Institutions (Consumer and merchant banks with checking and savings accounts) should not be able to use that DDA aggregate to collateralize market bets. Glass-stegal kind of got rid of that. Under Clinton (yes, with a Republican congress) we got rid of this for some reason. I don't know why we got rid of it, but it doesn't seem to have been positive. So, that's One. Number two is that when banks (these depository account asset banks) *should* be making their money doing \"loans\" to main-street. Yes, in current times they need to be careful (due-diligence). I get that. They aren't VC. But with essentially 0% interest rates, why would they lend *any* money. They essentially don't. Which is a problem for all of us ... because savings and loans is what they are supposed to do!\n\n&gt; It\u2019s true the rich may thrive on American wealth but let\u2019s not get too cozy about it. Our economic situation is not going to improve unless we do something about it.\n\nAgreed. So the question is to define the problem. What is one of the problems? Unemployment. Why? Labor not needed. Why? No (global) demand for American built products and services, at the price America can make/deliver them. Right? \n\nTell evil capitalists to hire more? To do what? There's no demand for American-built products. Why not? Expensive. Raise minimum wage? That makes it worse -- products more expensive. \"The rich should fix it\" -- well, they *do* fix their problem ... by exporting labor requirements to China and robots. Still leaves us with unemployment.\n\nSo, to solve unemployment, we need more demand for products/services. OK, --give-- everyone a job, those people will have demand? Well, sure -- they'll demand cheap products from China. American employer's will go bankrupt (no customers) and we are ... right back here.\n\nThen, what do we do about it? Well, let's break this down: why isn't America competitive with it's ability to build inexpensive consumer products? (Ignoring the fact that we are -- America is the largest manufacturing country in the world; we just don't need that many people to do it...)\n\nHint1: There is an answer to this core problem, if you break it down to its core elements.\n\nHint2: Having the government mandate prosperity has never in the history of the world ever worked.\n\nWe can chat about this later.

I think any new economic situation needs to account for some economic diversity. Interestingly 80/20 rule may be an ultimate goal? Where 20% may be more wealthy than the 80% but both should have a *better* quality of life. (Is this how this works?)\n\nHere is what I find a problem with the current buying and selling of corporate stock. Corporate sock is..... largely no longer a means to build capital to improve the company's product, its become a currency and the only expectation is to get some sort of quick ROI of 20% (that's HUGE). \n\nSmaller companies fear going public because of there is a lack of diversification for controlling interests, the company  loses their autonomy and is subject to the whims of their shareholders. I think there would be a lot of supporting evidence that the current corporate structure hurts small businesses. (I think this sort of research will be important in support for a new entity structure. Specifically to prove that technological advancements cannot easily come to fruition because seed capital must be obtained privately not publicly...I'll come back to this point)\n\nIn this economy I am under the assumption that \n\n1) There is a lack of jobs:\n\nCompanies (as previously discussed) have squeezed two jobs into one and have been increasingly pushing for productivity.\n\n2) American products are needed, we just have to change the products:\n\nThere are technological advancements every day! We could be building hover boards (heh)! But do we allow for new small business to really thrive. Is these products too expensive to build. &lt;---- and this is where I think the real problem is. The cost of todays goods are just too costly. You would need large sums of capital, but there's a problem.... banks are not loaning. Plus going public means losing autonomy of your business. \n\n&gt;Then, what do we do about it? Well, let's break this down: why isn't America competitive with it's ability to build inexpensive consumer products? (Ignoring the fact that we are -- America is the largest manufacturing country in the world; we just don't need that many people to do it...)&lt;\n\nYes this is key! I think its very important to do an analysis of why the costs of goods are rising. *If and it is what I suspect it is* It's the demand for ROI. I will have to do further research.  (But its the pressure that stock only increases if there is growth of net profit year after year.. which I've state before since NP is on a bell curve this is a huge problem. And therefore the price will artificially inflate)\n\nIf I have explained myself well, I'm going to bring this full circle\n\nIf the Top 1% wanted to simulate into a new 80/20 model wouldn't they just have to directly contribute capital to these small businesses? And it looks to me they have a lot of capital to contribute. Take their corporate stocks away and give these 1%ters a new investment opportunity. \"Investors Fees\" \n\nSo here is the unknown:\n\nDo you think it's possible if we dissolved corporate stocks and in turn asked the 1% to invest in these investors fees- Would capital flow more freely? Let's stop trading stocks like a currency and actually create new capital.\n\nSide Note:\nYes, because glass-steagall act's clock ran out ... and because of Alan Greenspan's human optimism, there went the housing crash.  Alan Greenspan turned a blind eye to the interest only loans knowing that they would default largely because of his confidence that banks wouldn't take any actions that would allow for the banks to collapse. He assumed banks would not intentionally hurt their own business....then we learned the terms \"too big to fail\". Sadly we all put faith in \"experts\" but really, experts are only good guessers. \n\nIt's great talking to you too! I think I may like to peruse this idea further and write a more detailed report.

Sorry!\n\nYes, this only attacks publicly traded stocks put on the market. All publicly traded stocks are byproducts of corporations. These include IPOs. And since the full plan is to transition ALL CORPS to this new structure, publicly traded stocks would be extinct.\n\n There are other forms of publicly traded equity. These would be publicly traded private equity funds (\"PEFs\"). These are Partnerships that combine LP interests in various other partnerships. Investors in PEFs will receive performance fees based on hurdle rates and income for the lower tiered partnerships. Essentially this falls under the same SEC rules as hedge funds.  What I like about PEF's (and I'm willing to leave these alone) is that they are not trading partnership interests daily or even hourly. Why? SEC Laws already state you need to have wealth of $1 million plus to be an investor. That is because investing is so risky. Good returns on PEF's take years of 5-10. So that would be a long term investment. The other benefits of PEFs is that SEC is very specific about how these funds are trading and are overseeing these very well in my opinion.  Note these SEC regulations do not come into play when you just buy a share of stock in a corporation.  Plus today if you want to be a little guy and invest in PEF you would have to buy publicly traded shares of a corp that invests in PEFs\u2026 well corps would be erased in this plan. So there goes that and PEF's after axing corps would still be under the SEC rules. Truth be told if you have the wealth to invest in PEFs, sure you can make great returns but you can also fail miserably! So I say let the rich keep taking these risks\u2026. it's like specialized gambling in my opinion, from my experience most don't do well. Its just a long term game of craps. \n\nOkay so here are opposing argument to your response. I'm going to boil these down. Hopefully I have fully grasp what your saying.\n\n1) Technological advancements cannot be stopped\u2026. and at the end of the day they will become successful.  And specifically we're talking advancements that change the status quo.\n\nA. Ah but we are only looking at success stories. There is a very full possibility that corps can swallow up good ideas. This is done  first when a person creates a patent. The creator of this patent probably has one of two choices. The can receive seed money from investors. Or they can sell their patent to the highest bidder. Unfortunately if the highest bidder is one of the largest corps in the world how could any amount of seed money compete? There is also speculation that these corps could instill fear, by threatening lawsuits which may make the uneducated submit to a patent sale. Its speculation but it certainly happens. Ack! I really don't want to get into specifics examples on a sunday. lol. \n\n2) Motivation could change everything\n\nA Yes. But this motivated person would have to have two qualities and be a lucky contender (if the situation above happened). For one they would have to be intelligent enough to create a patent. Secondly they would have to shun corporate money and take the lessor seed money. They may decide this for fame or creative control. But what if they just wanted to be rich? What if they were not philosophers and are just byproducts of out shitty college education system that focuses on learning trades and not expanding minds to such crazy things as philosophy. (kay so my hobby is philosophy and we philosophers got a lot of problems with today's world). Thirdly they would have to find seed money! Easier said than done! \u2026. Are we going to wait for this chanve to be fulfilled until we can get some decent technological innovation the opposes the status quo? Why not just facilitate the system so these technological advancements can happen a lot easier. \n\n3) What happens to the prices of our products??  Hey, we all like products, they allow us to be more profitable.\n\nThis idea works with capitalism. Yup, the only thing thats being changed is how you  culminate investors and please \"founders\". All the economic laws of capitalism still apply.\n\n4) Wealth gap? What wealth gap? (this may be a sideline topic to this discussion but I love talking about this!) \n\nWell the wealth gap is more clear for me to see for one simple reason. I'm at the high end of the wealth gap but my parents are at the bottom end. Mom works 50 plus hours and dad is full time worker who has a very physical job. He's getting older and each day the job is harder and harder for him to do. They always were at the min wage level so they only got enough $ together to buy a modest condo in their late 40s. And that is because they became blindsided about the growing cost of living. As a result they have to put in a lot of blood and sweat but don't have much to show for it (understandably this is relative but i believe advance civilizations should bring quality of life up\u2026 not create more of a struggle against the successful top)\n\nSo it's not class envy for me\u2026 this will be the hardest thing to explain but let me try. It's years of reading philosophy and translating it to not just sentiments but mathematics. (and I'm not lying this took years of learning!) But I will boil it down to how i went from a business mind to a belief in a sort of caring that should be extended to every human being.\n\nInherently our social structure today has very strong ideas that a person must 1) work hard to get to the top 2) a person is in the hands of their own destiny 3) unsuccessful persons is due to laziness or a sort of darwinian result of our nature.\n\nPhilosophy argues:\n\n1) the inherent structure of this system (that is capitalism) forces failure:\nheres the long a short of it wrapped in a neat metaphor.. and i just thought of this metaphor so here we go (lol!): You want plants in your garden to grow. You have one garden where you nourish the plants with enriched soil and the second garden you just throw seeds on the ground and see what happens. Throwing seeds in the ground does not give nearly as good results. Actually the tossed seeds do terribly. The tossed seeds translates to the poorer kids. #1 the education system in the citys they live in is shoty, #2 kids in poorer families have to deal with physical and mental anxieties such as inadequate food, abuse and lack of parental guidance since both parents must work. #3 Since these kids feel like they cannot be apart of society they become apart of something else; gangs, which leeds to crime.\n\nSo\u2026.kids in enriched soil, these are the kids living in towns with their is  wealth. Towns revenue increases from property taxes  and those towns can provide a better education. Also kids of the Middle class/wealthy come from fewer broken homes. Ect. and we'll move on\u2026 I think thats enough.\n\n2) The system only allows people with skills that can be used on the job to flourish, while others are forced to struggle:\n\nWhy should we allow some people to fail. Do they deserve to fail because of our darwinian structure? Many people can easily say \"sure\" there will be failures. But lets go here: We have a unconditional request of one another.  You may not feel it because we are so closed off from each individual person but it exists. We all request love, help, acceptance and even respect from one another. When we improve society so we can be more moral and accepting of one another we become happier people. Not only do you benefit from the good feelings but others benefit. I say lets make this societally less darwinian. And the argument that humans are humans and need to conquer over the failed\u2026 well i say neigh! We have much more heart. \n\nI can go into a full explanations if you are interested, I'd have to point you to some essays I could probably find online  but I just wanted a over simplified idea for now (just to see if it works). But I'll be happy to divulge further if necessary.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdwt461", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386534685", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdw7lsg", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428347663, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdw8cfe", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386466033", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdvdav0", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428348008, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sorry I'm just getting back!\nI agree with your business model. The new structure would turn VC into something similar to a  combination capital investment and a management fee found in a hedge fund.\n\nHeres an Example: there is the Venture A who invests 110,000 and Venture B who invests 30,000. \"Entity A\" is the business and then there is the Founder of the business. (so theres two venture capitalist and the Founder does not have any capital to contribute. Founder fees is 6%. Investors fee is 2% of VC Contributed  / Expected VC. Expected VC is $150,000 (similarly you estimate how many stocks should be sold to collect the necessary capital) and these fees are not paid until the 5th business day of Year 2 so they are still payable in year 1)\nHeres how the balance sheet would work It's year 1 of operations:\n\nAssets:\n\nCash 100,000\n\nInventory: 10,000\n\nTotal Assets 110,000\n\nLiabilities:\n\nNotes Payable: 20,000\n\nAccrued Founders Fee: 14,486\n\nAccrued Payable to Venture A: 5,311\n\nAccrued Payable to Venture B: 1,449\n\nEquity:\n\nVenture A: 110,000\n\nVenture B: 30,000\n\nEntity A - Net losses over revenue: (71,246)\n\nTotal Equity and Liabs 110,000\n\nIncome Statement:\n\nRevenue: 200,000\n\nInventory used: 70,000\n\nOperating Expenses:  180,000\n\nFounder Fee: 14,486\n\nInvestor Fee: 6,760\n\nNet Loss: (71,246)\n\nCashflow\n\nBeginning Cash: 0\n\nNet Loss: (71,246)\n\nInventory: (10,000)\n\nVenture Capital: 140,0000\n\nNotes Payable: 20,000\n\nFounder Fee Payable: 14,486\n\nInvestor Fee Payable: 6,760\n\nNet Change in Cash: $100,000\n\nCash flows allows the investor fee and founder fee to be paid in full. If this wasn't the case a waterfall would have to be set up per the articles of \"corporation/organization\"\n\n\nSo heres the whats up:\n\nI'm essentially creating the regulations for this new type of company. And ultimately I would like to appeal to capitalists and socialists alike. I don't necessarily have to kill wall street but i would like to change the animal. Does Wall Street  have to be so volatile, and if net profits are stagnate does investors need to jump ship?\n\nI would like to give more pie to the workers but thus far, I've fallen short of how to solve this. I am definitely leaving more room for regulations to better solve this problem. Really I would like to allow the \"people\" to shape this new org through social media. Just as lobbyists get a chance get to influence our current laws. \n\nI have to agree with you. The capitalist system has worked. But will it continue to work in the best interest of the people? To me the benefits of capitalism, like net profit, is a bell curve. It was wonderful in the beginning. It built innovation, gave people motivation to create, to act  proactively in commerce and ultimately improve our societal structure.  But currently we are falling down the bell curve and in a period where corporations are finding solutions  to grow net profits that are not beneficial to society as a whole. Since they cannot allow for net profits to stagnate, they have begun to turn to unethical practices (i think you would agree without further explanation).  Long and short corporations are influencing regulations regardless of what is best for society as a whole. As an example I think corps are preventing new technologies that would diminish current product markets. For example corporations have spent a lot of $ on lobbyist to promote the use of oil even though there may be other viable energy solutions. Fuel efficient cars have struggled, even when ultimately the consumer doesn't care what type of energy they use as long as its affordable and works.\n\nAt the end of the day I would like  this new entity idea to solve 4 things\n\n1) I would like to promote technological advancement regardless of large corporate influence (and i have an idea on patent law as well. but that's another topic i guess)\n\n2) Change the hyperactive stock market to a more of a market with long term yields. \n\n3) Spread wealth  to the middle and lower classes through better wages\n\n4) Reduce the power of corporations. (I believe if we change the nature of wall street we can reduce the income gap and therefore corporate and even individual wealth and thus their power)\n\nI hope to get lots of minds involved in this project so we can solve this problem all together. The only reason I would like to limit certain \"communist\" or \"socialist\" regulations is so we can still keep the concept of \"the free market\" so the idea can actually be acceptable by most people. And I recognize this will be a challenge for everyone,,,, it does make solving the issues that much harder.\n\nBottom line I'm trying to rework the system so we all have a much better future. Right now I'm fearing that our democracy is just being eaten up by wealth and corporate power. And that looks like a pretty dark future to me. \n\nLet me know if you need more info, and what you would think it would take to \"sell\" someone on the idea. \n\nThanks so much, I appreciate it!", "edited": 1386464684, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdw7lsg", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386464227", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdvc8kt", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428362758, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdvdav0", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386367525", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdv90pf", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428363253, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Direct labor\u2026 how could I forget?

It only really replaces the Founders personal stock options that a member of a corporation usually has. \n\nIn order to increase wages we can do a few things\n\n1)\tIncrease minimum wage (I do not like this option since it only helps the lowest paid employee and has to be lobbied for every so often)\n\n2)\tIt\u2019s possible to further incorporate more regulations into my new entity. (But then people will just call this idea communism and I\u2019ll have no hope of this ever happening)\n\n3)\tMake a tax code that gives incentives to business that pay employees well\n\nWell assuming I\u2019m creating a new entity I could also create the new tax code.... I\u2019m actually a tax accountant so I\u2019m totally up for this! Let me get this together\u2026\n\nUnless someone has a better idea? It\u2019s difficult to when putting regulations together, otherwise people will just call you a commie. So far I think this new capital structure works fine with capitalism and won\u2019t get peoples panties in a twist. \n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdvc8kt", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386365270", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdv6k8b", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428364755, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdv90pf", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386358536", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdv1yq4", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428365901, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks for the response! I like what you\u2019re saying\n\nOkay, Yes let's say this new corporate structure has the potential to help share more of the profitable income with workers. \n\nYour right profits are spent based on many factors. Usually it\u2019s about which will benefit the company the most; A second plant\u2026 Bigger offices\u2026 What's been noticeable is the increase in officer's salaries. I'm not sure why this is so? It seems to be some sort of market trend where the best CEO's expect an astronomical wage and then blue collar wages increases are off the table. (? Maybe this could be rectified by tax incentives to increase wages. Give  % increase get a % tax break?).\n\nYour right, maybe not so much \"Wall Street would be dead\" as the stock market would be dead.  Dissolve the current corporate structure and there would not be any public shares to trade on the stock market. Wall street could still function by trading \u201cInvestor Fees\u201d and investor fees would work much like a dividend, yes. But there will be a huge change in how Wall Street would function:\n\nA transition from a share-price-based compensation scheme to a profit-stream based compensation scheme would have some drastic economic effects! \n\nThe current share-price-based compensation system is driven by return on investment where the return is net profit. Most business\u2019s net profit acts like a bell curve. The business grows as it reaches new customers but then it peaks when it reaches its max market share and then profits either become stagnate or decline. Once Net profits stagnate share prices fall; this is because shareholders no longer want to hold onto the stock because the stock has reached its max selling, in turn they sell thier shares, saturating the market , dropping the prices. So business have to start to eat away at operating costs in order to keep their ROI growing and the share prices up. And ultimately that\u2019s how two jobs becomes one, more stress on the workers but no pay increases. \n\nSo let\u2019s take a look at the repercussions of this new entity structure with founders fees (=fraction where the Numerator would be the gross profit and the denominator would be cost of goods sold. Then multiplied by the gross profit times X%). Compared to net profits, gross profits are fairly steady depending on the materials used. If the COGS is less than the multiplier for your Founders fees increases. These new businesses will still have incentives to keep COGS low. There will also be an incentive for your product to reach more of a market share. But what\u2019s lovely is when market share peaks, you still get a founders fee. Your investment is not devalued. Capitalism\u2019s principles of the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d will still come into play here. So I wouldn\u2019t expect to have any adverse effects to inflate price of a product to get a better Founders fee.\n\nI think your right we should keep the separate legal entity structure. I think this is key and effective piece of the current system we have now. We don\u2019t want the founder to be liable if the entity is sued. \n", "edited": 1386353523, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdv6k8b", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386353317", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdv1mdq", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428368200, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1s6kyp", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdv1yq4", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1386343065", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cdukcot", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1428368365, "controversiality": 0, "body": "The key here is that the \"Founder\" would not be allocated directly from net profit but gross profit.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1gilm3", "selftext": "&gt; Detroit is not an example of what socialism (or any other ideology) does.\n\nYes. (and maybe).\n\n&gt; Detroit has very complex problems that are deeply rooted in its history,\n\nYes.\n\n&gt; its current status is in no way a direct consequence of some political ideology.\n\nMaybe. I'm not sure that this follows. You can certainly say that it isn't because of socialism. You could argue that it is a victim of regulatory and party \"capture\" and cronyism. I think that the bigger issue is that their promises to make certain payments in the future outstripped their stewardship of their investments or expected income. If you spend more than you make (think credit-cards or mortgages with adjustable rates) ... you *will* find yourself in financial trouble... regardless of what you spent it on.\n\nAs I see it, the problems of detroit stem from negative city-wide economic growth, hence negative government revenue growth. Coupled with cronyism and the tendency of politicians to say anything to get elected. After all, the politician that made the promise probably won't be around when the bill comes dues.\n\nA divided government, with divided control between parties, sometimes (?) slows down the coming train-wreck. Single party control (as you can see with either purely Republican or purely Democratic party control at the federal level) ... causes any checks-and-balances to go out the window. There are no brakes. And then the entire difference is which party wants to spend too much on what. And, to your point, this isn't ideology ... it is the failure to have a brake to out-of-control party dominance.\n\nEDIT: Hmm. Somebody disagreed with this comment, or a sub-set of this comment, or didn't think it added to the conversation, or thought it was off-topic or mis-guided/naive or even offensive.

It was in response to the claim in the post above me that (roughly) stated that socialists believe that spending is investment in future prosperity and that the other faction (whatever that may be) believes that not-spending/austerity/balanced-budget is the way to prosperity.\n\nThus, my point is that, regardless of the ideological underpinning of whoever votes for any taxing/spending projections/plans ... being fiscally irresponsible is being fiscally irresponsible. I think that is the point that you made at the end of the first sentence in your second paragraph.\n\nYour second sentence in the second paragraph: Agreed -- that is what I understood the point to be. My response is that there are a *lot* of exogenous variables that make his presumed conclusion to be ... well, inconclusive, as stated, to me.\n\nThird sentence: Agreed. This is what minarchists believe. Many of them are part of the US-style \"conservative\" coalition. \n\nFWIW: I am not really sure what \"conservative\" or \"liberal\" mean in US politics any more (if I ever did). They seem to be correlated in people's minds as making up the Republican and Democratic parties. Which in turn are fragile \"big tent\" coalitions of many special interest factions. Weird. Just like, somehow, progressive now is synonymous with socialism in many people's minds now. Propaganda by highjacking the definition of words is pernicious and makes it hard to read anything written historically with an eye towards understanding what the writer was trying to actually communicate. \n\n\n", "id": "t1_cako49d", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "zArtLaffer", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cakmuk5", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430779396, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cako49d", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1371492174", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_caklz9n", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430780007, "controversiality": 0, "body": "While Detroit is an example of socialism not working well (and there are many others) there are other examples of it performing well.
