{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Because the corporate income tax is easily the stupidest tax in existence, ever. There is no good economic argument in its defense that I'm aware of.  \n\nCorporate taxes, both in terms of the statutory tax rate and depreciation allowances, reduce investment and productivity growth. \n\nYou can't tax a corporation; you can only tax a person. Corporations are not wealthy; it's only people who enjoy wealth, not corporations. Corporations are a legal fiction that structures the association of people as shareholders, employees, customers and creditors. \n\nThe incidence of a corporate tax falls to a large extent on the worker; corporations compensate for the extra cost by lowering the wages they offer and/or increasing prices. It's not progressive at all: even the part that falls upon the shareholders (which is progressively smaller as capital mobility increases), is the same for me, a middle class family with stock in a 501(k) or the Walton heirs. By distorting and decreasing the return on investment, it reduces it. And investment is what drives long term growth. \n\n\nThe corporate income tax incentives firms to opt for debt financing instead of equity, because debt payments are deductible while dividends aren't. That exponentially increases the system risk in the economy. \n\nIt incentives companies to spend resources on tax avoidance. It's dramatically inefficient - companies spend exorbitant amounts of time and resources to be lower-taxed instead of investing them on productivity growth. The overwhelmingly majority of tax avoidance activity is corporate tax related. It incentives lobbying and corporations spending money in DC and not on satisfying consumers and being more efficient. It burdens the IRS with managing a super complicated system and taxpayers with the cost of trying to prevent corporations from swapping, moving, funnelling, deferring, deducting and so on. \n\nPlus, it puts big corporations at an advantage because they have the resources to afford the very expensive top fiscal attorneys and lobbyists. \n\nIt's just simpler, cheaper, fairer and more efficient to take the money from the people. \n\nThe corporate income tax doesn't really raise much revenue. We could recoup it by taxing dividends and capital gain. Tax people income. That would be much more progressive. It'd be much simpler. It'd solve most tax avoidance issues. It'd incentive corporations to reinvest more of their profits, to create more jobs, to take more risks. It incentive people to save and invest more money. We could have all income, tax or capital derived, taxed at the same level. It'd level the playing field for all corporations. It'd protect politicians from the constant lobbying. What's exactly not to like? Sole proprietorships, partnerships and S-corporations are taxed under the individual income tax. \n\nIn terms of policy decision-making, I put the corporate income tax on the same tier of teaching creationism in science classes. \n\nSome of the recent literature on the issue:\n\n\n[Measuring the Burden of the Corporate Income Tax under Imperfect Competition](http://ntj.tax.org/wwtax/ntjrec.nsf/175d710dffc186a385256a31007cb40f/785c5ab0cac6167985257b35007320ca/$FILE/A08_Altshuler.pdf), by Liu&amp;Altshuler, *We model and estimate the incidence of the corporate income tax under imperfect competition. Identi fication comes from variation in effective marginal tax rates in the United States across industries and time. Our empirical results suggest that labor bears a signi cant portion of the burden of the corporate income tax. In addition, we find that the elasticity of wages with respect to the corporate marginal effective tax rate increases with industry concentration. Over all industries, our estimates suggest that a one dollar increase in corporate tax revenue decreases wages by around 60 cents.*\n\n[Taxation of Income and Economic Growth: An Empirical Analysis of 25 Rich OECD Countries](http://www.nek.lu.se/publications/workpap/papers/WP12_6.pdf),  Dackehag &amp; Hansson, 2012, *More precisely we study how statutory tax rates on corporate and personal income affect economic growth by using panel data from 1975 till 2010 for 25 rich OECD countries. We find that both taxation of corporate and personal income negatively influence economic growth. The correlation between corporate income taxation and economic growth is more robust, however.*\n\n[Do tax structures affect aggregate economic growth?

Alison Felix, 2007, *High rates of corporate taxation reduce corporate investment and thereby depress local wages. Using cross-country data I estimate that a ten percentage point in crease in the corporate tax rate of high-income countries reduces mean annual gross wages by seven percent.(...)*\n\n[The Impact of Tax Cuts on Economic Growth: Evidence from the Canadian Provinces](http://ntj.tax.org/wwtax/ntjrec.nsf/009a9a91c225e83d852567ed006212d8/d2eeb9d5f1d7f7ea85257a6f00551c60/$FILE/A03_Ferede.pdf), Ferede&amp;Dhalby, 2012, *Our empirical estimates suggest that a 1 percentage point cut in the corporate tax rate is related to a 0.1\u20130.2 percentage point increase in the annual growth rate.*\n\n[The dynamic effects of personal and corporate income tax changes in the United States](http://www.bde.es/investigador/papers/sie1206.pdf), Mertens and Ravn, 2012, *A 1 percentage point cut in the average personal income tax rate raises real GDP per capita by 1.4 percent in the first quarter and by up to 1.8 percent after three quarters. A 1 percentage point cut in the average corporate income tax rate raises real GDP per capita by 0.4 percent in the first quarter and by 0.6 percent after one year*\n\n[Tax Policy For Economic Recovery and Growth](https://www.kent.ac.uk/economics/documents/research/papers/2009/0925.pdf), Arnolds et al, 2011, *This paper identifies tax policy that both speeds\nrecovery from the current economic crisis andcontributes to long-run growth. This is a challenge because short-term recovery requires increases in demand while long-term growth requires increases in supply. As short-term tax concessions can be hard to reverse, this implies that policies to alleviate the crisis could compromise long-run growth* *They find that 1$ shift from income taxes to consumption and property taxes would increase GDP by between 0.25 percent and 1 percent in the long run*\n\n\n[The macroeconomic effects of tax changes: estimates based on a new measure of fiscal shocks,](http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~dromer/papers/RomerandRomerAERJune2010.pdf), Romer &amp; Romer, 2010, `*The behavior of output following these more exogenous changes indicates that tax increases are highly contractionary.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I disagree modern governments in developed countries can't function at even a minimal level. Your threshold seems to be too strict. If the functionality of the governments in West democracies is below the minimum, what would one say about most of the others? \n\n\nAnyway, governments are inherently dysfunctional to some degree. Governments are a human institution and humans are flawed. And generally there's a correlation between the size of the government and how functional it is - albeit there are arguably stronger ones, namely with cultural, economical and historical factors. I don't see a reason to believe that technological advancements should affect this. But there's a lot more services under government provision now that at any point in history before the XX century, so it's easier to identify the failures. When governments basically only existed to provide security against foreign invasion and internal assault/theft/fraud, it was much easier for them to be functional.\n\nMy views on the reasons for government failure are more or less the ones expressed here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_choice\n\nAnyway, I think the US political institutions have been doing a pretty decent job. The goal of \"form[ing] a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence,[note 1] promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America\" has been accomplished to a fairly decent degree. \n\nI suspect the problem here is believing that it's possible to find perfect or near optimal political arrangements. That through political action -legislation, government action- it's possible to cure the disorder of the world. The Founding Fathers never believed in such a thing - quite the contrary, they were deeply aware that wasn't possible. If you believe in immanentizing the eschanton, you'll end up perpetually disappointed.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1ec7xu", "selftext": "&gt; A union wants to protect the jobs of it's members. How is that not in the general interest of the Nation?\n\nIt can be in a variety of ways. Protecting the jobs of union members is most likely in the interest of the union members who have jobs. If of anyone else -especially of the unemployed, non union members, consumers, etc-, it depends.\n\nFor example, unions frequently fight for protectionist measures to protect their members jobs, like tariffs on imported goods. But it's pretty consensual that protectionism is a loss for pretty much everybody else except those protected. What's more relevant to the interest of the nation: a) unionized shoe factory workers having a job, shoe factory owners making a profit while producing shoes inefficiently with consumers being forced to pay more for shoes and the import company and the shipping company employing less people or b) consumers paying less for shoes because they can buy cheaper shoes that were produced more efficiently then use the saved money to buy more stuff that someone else will have to produce and sell. Or maybe save it - and savings become investment and that investment feeds more efficient businesses, new factories, new jobs. In scenario A), the union jobs were protected. But only a few people benefit from that while everybody else lost. They can surely call their own interest \"the general interest of the Nation\", but that's just an excuse.\n\nUnions often fight to keep inefficient industries in place -because, once again, they want to protect the jobs of its members. For example, in the 70s some people wanted to subsidize typewriting machine factories and over-tax personal computer producers in order to save jobs. Do you think that would be in the \"general interest of the Nation\"? What about public unions that permanently fight for more taxes to fund their jobs, even when that is leading to an erosion of the fiscal base because business and non-union workers leave the community to avoid the high taxes? \n\nIf existing jobs are protected -and that's what unions purpose is- the overall economic efficiency tends to go down.  Unions have a bias towards existing jobs and to unionized jobs within those existing jobs (and it's their right to be biased). That's rarely good for the economy though. Most of the new jobs created tend to come from new business. Some jobs are always in the peril of being extinct as some functions, skills and tasks become anachronistic. The economy grows through a creative destruction process - and often unions become obstacles to the destruction part, which prevents the creation part from happening. \n\nThe \"general interest of the Nation\" is, at best, very difficult, and arguably impossible, to define. In a free society, there's a plurality of values and different ways of ranking them. People have different conceptions of what is \"the general interest of the Nation\", what is a good life and what produces good lives. There are competing views. Everyone who wants to shut down part of the competing views because he doesn't agree with them is a totalitarian creep and the type of person that made totalitarian regimes like nazism and communism possible. If there is a general interest, there are many different views of what that general interest is and they all ought to be respected in a democracy. \n\nSo unions defend particular interests or their particular view of the general interest, just like corporations do. I'm not sure why do you have a problem with profits. Profit is what allows corporations to re-invest, creating more jobs. Corporations without profits close doors. Without corporations, there are no jobs. Why are the motivations of unions or anyone else any more noble? It's fine if you believe some self-interests are better than others because they're closer to yours; what's sad is that you want to censor those with different self-interests.

As for wars, nobody likes war; some understand that sometimes they're necessary.\n\nAlthough I very much this type of dichotomy and aggregation - fiscal conservative, military spending- you'll see the contradiction you seem to be suggesting doesn't really exist if you actually try to understand the conservative perspective of this. \n\nAs a preface, it's important to notice that conservatism doesn't lend itself to schematic and conceptual explanations. Conservatives tend to dislike and be highly suspicious of the usage of abstractions. Burke never wrote anything like Mill's On Liberty or Marx's Manifesto. He wrote about concrete events and cases, situated in a determined time and place - and against \"theoretical reasoning\" when applied to political and social questions. This to say that addressing this sort of question in these terms is something conservatives will patiently try to do but their heart won't be in it.\n\nAnyway, \"fiscal conservatism\" basically refers to the individual right to be free from interference by other people except that he voluntarily accepts. This implies that contracts between private individuals and property must be protected and that's the conservative rationale for the existence of the state: to protect individuals from aggression, theft, breach of contract, it's necessary the existence of a court system, law enforcement (to protect from domestic aggression) and a military (to protect from foreign aggression).\n\nAnd here we arrive at military spending - the purpose is to protect the individuals in the community from foreign aggression. It's not so much that security of the community is more or less important. It's that their both complementary and intertwined. None of them is an overriding value, which means that often are tensions. Conservatives don't believe in optimum or perfect political arrangements, so they don't believe there's a final solution for this tension. And this is where it becomes impossible to go further in the realm of abstractions.\n\nAnyway, nobody supports wars prima facie, that's just a strawman; supporting more or less military spending is a matter of circumstances; supporting military spending in abstract is entirely consistent with fiscal conservatism.

For example, Manufacturing, Railroads and Chemicals support it. Museums and Pro-Business Associations oppose it. This involves a large degree and uncertainty, because most corporations and individuals are basically indifferent to the faith of the CISPA, but that's not even the problem.\n\nHere's how they aggregate employers in two different camps:\nhttp://maplight.org/us-congress/bill/113-hr-624/1116571/total-contributions\n\nThen they aggregate individual campaign contributions plus PACs contributions by employer and come to these numbers. \n\nFor example, let's pick the Congressman most staunchly and vocally opposed to this bill, Justin Amash.\n\nHe got $122,100 in contributions from pro-CISPA groups and $0 from anti-CISPA groups.\n\nIf you're a bank clerk (or a train machinist, or a tech, or a trader, or a pharmacist, or pretty much every job in the economy) who hates CISPA and you donated to Amash because you agree with his positions on this type of issues, your contribution is listed here as \"pro-CISPA\".

However, within that thought experiment, you can opt out of the social contract by simply not fulfilling your obligations and doing whatever you want. You can either go enter into a different social contract with someone else, or if you choose not to participate in any social contract whatsoever, you have opted *into* the state of nature.

Now, the whole idea of a social contract isn't compelling to everyone because it's purely hypothetical, so I'll happily answer your question another way, if you prefer ...\n\n2) More to the point, you can choose whether to pay taxes or move to another country, or even your own deserted island. Nobody is forcing you to stay here, and you are not automatically entitled to enjoy the lifestyle we provide here without helping pay for it.\n\n&gt; The government declared the dollar the only legal tender, it created a monopoly on money. \n\nSo what? Nobody's forcing you to use any money at all. It's not the government's fault if you don't know how to survive without the service they provide. \n\nBesides, I'm not sure a \"monopoly\" helps your argument at all. If you stripped away all government and all taxation, monopolies would still exist. Is it \"robbery\" if there's only one company around that sells widgets, and you decide you can't live without a widget? Are you automatically entitled to widgets even if you don't want to pay for them?\n\n&gt; Saying his friend determined voluntarily that it would be more convenient and desirable to opt in to the entire package deal is specious. You can decide to not have satellite tv, to create your own satellite tv company, offering whatever channels you want. Your decision to buy that package is voluntarily. You aren't coerced into it, you don't go to jail if you decide not to. \n\nYou don't go to jail for moving out of the country, for creating your own country on a deserted island somewhere, or for not using money. You only have to pay taxes if you consume the public goods by (a) living in the country and (b) using government dollars, which are choices you get to make. You're not *forced* to do either. You're just accustomed to them, and perhaps you now take them for granted.\n\n&gt; Your entire argument seems to be a petitio principii. \n\nNot at all. Your argument seems to hinge on an implicit sense of *entitlement* toward the American lifestyle -- a lifestyle that, like it or not, has been built on a system of taxation.

So regardless if they did answered my title question exactly or not, I like them all as they provide an important insight on the topic. I actually agree with most of you guys, if not all. This is a very extensive issue which might be looked at from different vantage points. I personally use to think that such security measures as implemented for example at the airports are actually kind of useful, at least here in the UK I personally never had any kind of problem when coming through a security. Also the same in the US. That is however just a drop in the sea and there is a lot of invisible things which might not appear existent on the first look but when one actually starts to do some research they can realize that there is a lot to be concerned about. I am not particularly familiar with the US Patriot Act but I have heard a lot of academic and non-academic critique on the this legislative. The question is: is it actually worth to try to fight terrorists who probably aim to scare the population in a manner that might result in actions in which the government enforces and uses the containing power against its own citizens, therefore terrorizes its own citizens as well?

Your chart says to me that a more worthwhile goal would be to focus on attaining similar mobility rates across all the quintiles, rather than focusing on the gap between quintiles.\n\nGood answer.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9jxpic", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366590504", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Jooana", "id": "t1_c9jr5y6", "parent_id": "t3_1cszd6", "score": 9, "retrieved_on": 1431478642, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c9jr5y6", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1366570462", "distinguished": null, "ups": 9}

The findings from the students' paper are 0-30 debt/GDP , 4.2% growth;   30-60, 3.1 %;  60-90, 3.2%,;  over 90, 2.2%.  The decline in rate is a bit less drastic but it's still substantial (and it's very similar to that found in other papers by Reinhart and Rogoff [1], which makes the fraud accusation even more bizarre).\n\nThird, what was the Republican budged based on this paper? As far as I know, the last Republican budget (aka the Ryan Budget) grows government spending by 3.2% per year for the next decade. Is this austerity now? \n\nFourth, the idea that countries have followed austerity policies because of this paper is a myth. First, I'm not sure if there's a country where government spending has actually diminished. More importantly, the rationale for the so-called austerity wasn't \"oh, we need to cut down the debt so that the economy can start growing again\".

Even that group leader was forced to admit that they wouldn't observe in precincts in the election day in most states, including Texas.\n\nI'm not sure what is the Human Rights act you're talking about. Care to expand? In any case, those UN \"human rights act\" aren't worth the paper they're written in. First, they're riddled with positive rights that are actually privileges and aren't enforceable. Second, lots of repressive regimes and 3rd world dictatorships have adopted it. What for? It's only a piece of paper to make emotional people feel good. \n\nThe entire Human Rights/UN thing is pathetic. This is just the most recent example:\n\n*GENEVA, Nov. 23 \u2013 UNESCO\u2019s executive board, which includes the US, France, the UK and other Western democracies, unanimously elected Syria to a pair of committees \u2013 one dealing directly with human rights issues \u2013 even as the Bashar al-Assad regime maintains its campaign of violence against its own citizens.\n\nThe Arab group at UNESCO nominated Syria for the spots, and though the 58-member board approved the pick by consensus on Nov. 11, the agency has not yet posted the results on its website.*\n\nhttp://www.unwatch.org/cms.asp?id=2750557&amp;campaign_id=65378\n\nWhat kind of credibility in the realm of Human Rights has an organization that routinely attributes important roles in that area to countries like Syria? \n\nAnyway, I can only speak by myself: the ONU is mostly a (very expensive) golden parachute for the political elites and high-level bureaucrats from all over the world. It's a cesspool of  nepotism, corruption and waste of resources. Most of the stuff they do has no visible impact in the real world. Countries routinely ignore any UN resolutions and they're only enforceable if all the permanent members of the Security Council are in agreement. Of course, those countries can also avoid any type of resolutions they might dislike by simply vetoing them. \n\nThe UN is a huge waste of money. The positive humanitarian interventions they do could be done more efficiently. A forum to concert international relationships and allow permanent diplomatic contact can be useful, but it can be done in more efficient and less onerous ways, especially in this day and age.

In 10 years, more than half of the 1-percenters drop out of it.\n\nb) children don't fill tax returns. And the Census (and the PSID) uses top coding - the questionnaire offers categories of incoming, with the highest being \"above $250,000\". Therefore Census based data isn't useful for the study of very high incomes. Which means there's a lack of long longitudinal data for intergenerational social mobility involving very high (or very low) incomes, so studies are focused on short-term mobility.\n\nThe Treasury published a paper in 2006 studying relative social mobility, including top 1% earners, in a 10 year period. Check table 1, page 7.\n\n57.4% of the top 1% of households in 1996 had dropped to a lower income group by 2005 and 13% had dropped out of the top 10%. About 8% of the top 1% in 2005 was out of the top 10% in 1996 - so middle class and poorer households.\n\nhttp://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/Documents/incomemobilitystudy03-08revise.pdf\n\nIf you're interested in the answer for quintiles, then this chart offers a decent summary: \n\nhttp://imgur.com/eRSGIlI\n\nThe source of data was the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, a representative sample of 0-18 years old in 1968 that were tracked for 35 years (the average age of the top-1% is 47 year old).\n\nBasically it shows 39% of the children born in top-20% families remain there and 42% of the children born in bottom-20% families stay poor. Those born in the middle quintiles - lower, middle and upper middle-class - have more or less even chances of becoming really rich or really poor.\n\nSource: Economic Mobility in America, by Sawhill et al\n\nAs an additional note, I think people tend to focus too much on relative social mobility and the 1%.
