In any case, I think the NRA has plenty of legitimacy from its base. It has around 5 million members; for reference, the ACLU has 500,000. 41% of Americans view the NRA in a positive light (and 34% in a negative light).

If that makes sense...\n\nIn my opinion, the gun control people have traditionally been the ones to escalate the issue. When was the last time a US congressman introduced a pro-gun law out of the blue? If I had to guess, I'd say the FOPA in 1986 (into which a senator inserted more gun control, in a way that broke the rules of the senate). Since then, we've had the Brady bill, 1994 AWB, expansions of the NICS system, and Feinstein's attempts to renew the AWB pretty much every year since 2004. Before that, we had bans on guns that are invisible to x-rays (which don't exist), bans on 'armor-piercing bullets' (which aren't necessarily armor piercing), the 1968 GCA, the 1934 NFA, and more. I don't think you can say that there's really a pro-gun paradigm in the federal government.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1ckqrt", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "FlyingSquirrelTyphus", "id": "t1_c9itcpg", "parent_id": "t1_c9i6su6", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431495062, "controversiality": 0, "body": "The NRA achieved legitimacy before their lobbying arm ever accomplished anything.

I am not discounting the power of the NRA, but I am arguing that their power derives from: A)their role as the primary gun safety, early gun education, and gun issues awareness group in America B)their success in advocating for pro-gun policies c)their ability to shift the gun debate through legal and political avenues d)many Americans like guns.\n\nI completely disagree about the escalation point. The NRA has been pushing legal test cases for years in an attempt to get the courts to create new precedent that favors wide open gun policy, which they do, which is met with increased gun control efforts to conform the laws to new cases. Heck, in GA, we had several very strong pro-gun bills come up during the legislature this year. I get that these aren't federal bills being introduced, but guns are addressed almost ever year by at least a couple state legislatures and often times it is expanding access or concealed carry locations. I think it is also important to point out that the Brady Bill, AWB, NICS, and the 1968 GCA all passed with bipartisan support. Reagan in fact supported the Brady Bill and the AWB. I mention that since Reagan seems to have a reputation for being incredibly pro-gun. The reason why I think the we have institutionalized pro-gun policies is that the status quo is to reject any gun control reforms pretty much out of hand.
