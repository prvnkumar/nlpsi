S corps are considered personal income, C corps corporate income, and thus weren't included in personal income calculations.  but that is a pure accounting shift, not a real shift in income, and it alone is responsible for at least 1/3 of the increase in income inequality since 1980.\n\n&gt;How has changing demographics affected our perception of income inequality? \n\nIn short, in recent years people have been getting married later, and poor people especially aren't getting married.  imagine a society where poor people make X and rich people make 5X.  if everyone works and everyone gets married, the average rich house makes 10x, poor house makes 2x.  but if half of those poor people don't get married, the average income per poor household drops to 1.5x, even though every single poor person makes just as much money.  \n\n&gt;I thought there was a pretty good measurement of peoples income,\n\nNo, this is a far, far more complicated subject than people think.

Medicare makes up a huge part of total healthcare spending and the CMS has a huge influence on how 98% of hospitals and a significant number of private practices do business. You can't have any discussion about healthcare spending and *not* address Medicare. I understand what you're saying about how it got put in the ACA but no one who works in health care was surprised. Medicare is the only way to start holding providers accountable for heathcare outcomes (which is the last thing they want). It may have looked like a last minute \"here, we'll just add this and make the numbers add up\" but had it been introduced early on, it would have been *destroyed* by the proAMA lobbyists.The part D and advantage stuff is largely smoke and mirrors, what's important is the move towards pay for performance. Medicare is leverage to force the medical community to admit that we need to look in the mirror.\n\nHealthcare is quick to pick up new treatments and diagnostic technology but we are painfully slow when it comes to cultural change. Defensive care has become the status quo and the only thing scarier to a hospital than a malpractice suit is the thought of losing Medicare eligibility so applied correctly, it could be a powerful motivation to initiate improvements. As I before, Medicare patients don't get treated in a vacuum, so improvements in their outcomes tend to lead to improvements in all patients. \n\nSpecifically addressing your point about EHR's... The capital outlay for a private practice to switch to an EHR is high, so even when the benefit to the system is high they may be reluctant to make the leap. The incentives are basically there to help out with the cost in order to speed up the inevitable. Again you make a valid point about past performance but the initial focus was on data collection (which has gone well), the next push is for interoperability. It's a complex process, but we've made great strides in secure transmission protocols of private information. Adaptation of one way transmission to systems  like statewide pharmacy records has been in place for awhile (which I know, raises it's own discussion), now we're working on the ability for outpatient clinics and hospitals to share information. Again, great at accepting new treatments, slow to change the cultural of day to day business. \n\nI get it, I really do. It's terrible legislation. The stink of the lobbyists is high. I'm not trying to say the ACA is the end all be all. But it's the law until it isn't, which could be 12 months from now or 12 years from now so I'm just going to keep trying to make lemons into lemonade. There are opportunities to make some much needed changes if the medical community is ready to step up and think outside the box. It's truly a fascinating time to be in the field of health care. Incredibly frustrating at times, but interesting none the less. \n\nThank you for the thoughtful\n conversation. \n\nEdit: I do agree with you that it changes the political landscape and creates new classes of stakeholders and I understand your frustration with that but \"real\" reform is a misnomer.

That's a massive chunk. \n\nOf course, this was never supposed to be a pissing match about who spent what, because from 2008 onward that's just ignoring that we had a massive recession, which was the whole point of my reply. Of course we're going to be spending more and taxing less, that's what happens in a recession. Aside from potentially blaming Bush for being responsible in part for the recession in the first place (another whole debate, and one that I won't be having in this thread), you can't really blame Bush for the stimulus spending any more than you can blame Obama for it.

Then the war in Iraq was payed for with borrowed money. Then Medicare part D created a $600 billion dollar debt, \n\nNone of this has ANYTHING to do with the current deficits.  Nothing at all.  All of these things existed in 2007, when deficit was 150 billion.  To pretend that these things are responsible for the trillion plus deficits of the obama administration is simply dishonest.\n\n&gt;The ACA has not added a single net dollar to the deficit. Healthcare costs were climbing at an alarming rate, which was adding to our deficits, and the ACA attempts to control those costs to reduce the impact of healthcare costs on the deficit and thus the national debt. At this point, repealing the ACA would cost $200-$300 billion, which would of course increase our deficit.\n\nThis is even more dishonest.  The ACA is projected to add 180 billion dollars of expenditure EVERY year it is in operation.  the estimates that it would lower the deficit were based on medicare cuts, a number of tax hikes, and the inclusion of extraneous programs that had nothing to do with the actual bill.  Of those, the medicare cuts almost certainly will not happen, a number of extraneous bits have been removed, and the parts of the bill that have gone into effect are already way over budget.  It is madness to assume that the rest will come in under budget.\n\nEven worse, there is simply nothing in the ACA that controls costs in any meaningful way.

For most government workers beyond the bottom tier it's a constant grind to get promoted to a higher and higher position, and that means if you're really good enough to be in a position, it's a sure bet you'll shortly be promoted out of it.\n\nWhat does that mean? Eventually the only people who stay in positions are those who aren't good enough to promote out of it- they're just good enough to do the job that they're at, to fill the space and get the right reports saying the right thing to their boss, and aren't in any way excellent. Mediocrity gets baked into the system. That's where the problem comes in, because the guy who stayed up nights to count pieces of paper is off somewhere counting something much more valuable, and the golf playing guy believes whatever number Susan hands him and never bothers to go check.\n\nThere's where efficiency goes to die, because there are (ahem...were as of Oct 1st) thousands of government employees who are ensconced in their jobs, and are spinning their wheels toward retirement, and don't really give a shit if their work is stellar, because they'll never promote.\n\nDon't be confused- there are also many thousands of people dedicated to their jobs and are doing their part for the American people, especially at the people-facing lowest levels, where the rubber meets the road. And the top levels are filled with those people who were the best and got promoted, they do amazing things. It's the rotten middle that's often the problem. they make stupid rules to justify their own jobs, pinch some pennies and lose others, and generally just...spin their wheels a lot, as I said. Since they're so autonomous, they can fake the funk for a good long time before the ceiling caves in and all the things they've left undone see the light of day.\n\nBack to the main point- how do you improve that? Firing all those people and cutting programs won't help -it's a systemic issue. All you do is deprive the American people of that service. Sure, it'll score some politician points, but at the ground level, someone's losing some help they asked and maybe even voted for, and that sucks.\n\nThere's only one real solution- hire good administrators. Seems easy, right? Then enters politics. Some people have their jobs for reasons other than their ability to do a good job, and those people are often protected by their benefactors. At the middle high levels it can be a matter of what political party or ideology they represent, because that makes sure the 'right' rules are passed own through the organization that supports that party or ideology. \n\nThis post is a freaking novel because the problem is literally that complicated. I've worked in government at all levels for most of my working life, I've seen the inefficiency, been part of the inefficiency, and risen about the inefficiency. It's not as easy as 'kill the extra programs!' That might make the dollars and cents look better, but that doesn't make anything any more efficient, because the programs that remain still have the same problems they did before.\n\nDo I have an answer? hell no.

Organizations the size of empires, which survived for centuries and spanned decent portions of the entire planet. Your claim just does not bear true in any way shape or form.\n\n&gt; It doesn't have to. by eliminating the other programs, it makes the higher ups more likely to notice those other programs.\n\nNot really, still numbers and words on a page or screen to them. They're interested in results, not which programs do what. Every person in government has a mission. If they perform that mission with X,Y, and Z programs, or if they do so with A and B, political concerns aside, they don't care. They just want to walk into their bosses office and say they completed the mission and did so on time, and under budget. The guy who does that consistently gets noticed. \n\nThe guy managing five departments wouldn't even be managing 50. There would be 9 other guys hired to do that. \n\nThe logic you're claiming doesn't make sense. The US shouldn't cut programs to make the workload easier for some bureaucrat, or even to make government 'more efficient', It should cut programs because they don't have a purpose. If they serve a purpose to the people of the US, regardless of efficiency, they need to exist.\n\nThe whole call for 'efficiency' is buzzword usage and another excuse for trying to 'reduce the size of government'. \n\nAll of that is well and good, but when a person claims they want to reduce government for 'efficiency's' sake- \n\nAlways pay attention not to what they want to reduce, but what they *don't* want to reduce. \n\nPay attention to what they get from a smaller government- ask yourself what regulations they're trying to escape from, or if their plan is to simply pay less taxes, and ask yourself what their plan is for the people who will be hurt by the reduction in services.\n\nI bet money it's never about the 'efficiency' of anything, it's about enhancing their position and that of the people they represent. People who want to improve the efficiency of something don't start by attempting to destroy it.\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ccledmp", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1380949778", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cclb1v7", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1429240861, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1nr57y", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cclb88r", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1380937576", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_ccmoof5", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Chernobyl_Rat", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cclb1v7", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429217190, "controversiality": 0, "body": "So the problems are in the middle layers, which are far removed from both the public and the higher ups in the government (defined as president and legislative branch)?

They know the names of every person directly beneath them, and have already reassigned or laid off Jerry because his job went away. \n\nIt's the shitty administrator that was off playing golf and missed those facts, and it that shitty administrator who will make the news when all this is discovered and will lose his position and career over his lack of attention to detail. \n\nHere's the real deal with government efficiency- they constantly promote the best people away from where they're needed. For most government workers beyond the bottom tier it's a constant grind to get promoted to a higher and higher position, and that means if you're really good enough to be in a position, it's a sure bet you'll shortly be promoted out of it.\n\nWhat does that mean? Eventually the only people who stay in positions are those who aren't good enough to promote out of it- they're just good enough to do the job that they're at, to fill the space and get the right reports saying the right thing to their boss, and aren't in any way excellent. Mediocrity gets baked into the system. That's where the problem comes in, because the guy who stayed up nights to count pieces of paper is off somewhere counting something much more valuable, and the golf playing guy believes whatever number Susan hands him and never bothers to go check.\n\nThere's where efficiency goes to die, because there are (ahem...were as of Oct 1st) thousands of government employees who are ensconced in their jobs, and are spinning their wheels toward retirement, and don't really give a shit if their work is stellar, because they'll never promote.\n\nDon't be confused- there are also many thousands of people dedicated to their jobs and are doing their part for the American people, especially at the people-facing lowest levels, where the rubber meets the road. And the top levels are filled with those people who were the best and got promoted, they do amazing things. It's the rotten middle that's often the problem. they make stupid rules to justify their own jobs, pinch some pennies and lose others, and generally just...spin their wheels a lot, as I said. Since they're so autonomous, they can fake the funk for a good long time before the ceiling caves in and all the things they've left undone see the light of day.\n\nBack to the main point- how do you improve that? Firing all those people and cutting programs won't help -it's a systemic issue. All you do is deprive the American people of that service. Sure, it'll score some politician points, but at the ground level, someone's losing some help they asked and maybe even voted for, and that sucks.\n\nThere's only one real solution- hire good administrators. Seems easy, right? Then enters politics. Some people have their jobs for reasons other than their ability to do a good job, and those people are often protected by their benefactors. At the middle high levels it can be a matter of what political party or ideology they represent, because that makes sure the 'right' rules are passed own through the organization that supports that party or ideology. \n\nThis post is a freaking novel because the problem is literally that complicated. I've worked in government at all levels for most of my working life, I've seen the inefficiency, been part of the inefficiency, and risen about the inefficiency. It's not as easy as 'kill the extra programs!' That might make the dollars and cents look better, but that doesn't make anything any more efficient, because the programs that remain still have the same problems they did before.\n\nDo I have an answer? hell no. Smarter people than me have failed to crack this nut. Just remember this though, that when someone tells you it's as simple as cutting waste or whatever...it's not, and they know it, because they're part of the system they're trying to run down.

His boss doesn't have to show up or run day-to-day operations, he just makes a set of work rules and administrative rules and implementation of laws and sends it to the mid-level guy, who is then expected to do his job (which is to make sure everyone under him is doing their job) and make himself as invisible as possible.\n\nThe boss gets several reports from all the mid-level people underneath him or her and then calls meetings to get everyone on the page.

Unless they get caught committing felonies, civil servants are almost never fired, even for gross incompetence. Can you cite even one example of a civil servant being fired in recent years for non-criminal activity?\n\nI know several personally. I've been standing there when they got fired. went to the arbitration, participated in the vote to remove, and watched them pack their stuff and get escorted out of the building.\n\n&gt; No, that isn't a good solution. Organizations beyond a certain size simply cannot be administered well, because no one person knows enough about them to administer them. The problem cannot be solved with better people.\n\nInteresting, because over the span of human history, most great things that has ever been done has been done with the assistance of organizations, most of which had massive structures, and most of which had a single person at the top. Organizations the size of empires, which survived for centuries and spanned decent portions of the entire planet. Your claim just does not bear true in any way shape or form.\n\n&gt; It doesn't have to. by eliminating the other programs, it makes the higher ups more likely to notice those other programs.\n\nNot really, still numbers and words on a page or screen to them. They're interested in results, not which programs do what. Every person in government has a mission. If they perform that mission with X,Y, and Z programs, or if they do so with A and B, political concerns aside, they don't care. They just want to walk into their bosses office and say they completed the mission and did so on time, and under budget. The guy who does that consistently gets noticed. \n\nThe guy managing five departments wouldn't even be managing 50. There would be 9 other guys hired to do that. \n\nThe logic you're claiming doesn't make sense. The US shouldn't cut programs to make the workload easier for some bureaucrat, or even to make government 'more efficient', It should cut programs because they don't have a purpose. If they serve a purpose to the people of the US, regardless of efficiency, they need to exist.\n\nThe whole call for 'efficiency' is buzzword usage and another excuse for trying to 'reduce the size of government'. \n\nAll of that is well and good, but when a person claims they want to reduce government for 'efficiency's' sake- \n\nAlways pay attention not to what they want to reduce, but what they *don't* want to reduce. \n\nPay attention to what they get from a smaller government- ask yourself what regulations they're trying to escape from, or if their plan is to simply pay less taxes, and ask yourself what their plan is for the people who will be hurt by the reduction in services.\n\nI bet money it's never about the 'efficiency' of anything, it's about enhancing their position and that of the people they represent. People who want to improve the efficiency of something don't start by attempting to destroy it.\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ccledmp", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1380949778", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_cclb1v7", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1429240861, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1nr57y", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cclb88r", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1380937576", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_ccmoof5", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Chernobyl_Rat", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cclb1v7", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429217190, "controversiality": 0, "body": "So the problems are in the middle layers, which are far removed from both the public and the higher ups in the government (defined as president and legislative branch)?

They know the names of every person directly beneath them, and have already reassigned or laid off Jerry because his job went away. \n\nIt's the shitty administrator that was off playing golf and missed those facts, and it that shitty administrator who will make the news when all this is discovered and will lose his position and career over his lack of attention to detail. \n\nHere's the real deal with government efficiency- they constantly promote the best people away from where they're needed. For most government workers beyond the bottom tier it's a constant grind to get promoted to a higher and higher position, and that means if you're really good enough to be in a position, it's a sure bet you'll shortly be promoted out of it.\n\nWhat does that mean? Eventually the only people who stay in positions are those who aren't good enough to promote out of it- they're just good enough to do the job that they're at, to fill the space and get the right reports saying the right thing to their boss, and aren't in any way excellent. Mediocrity gets baked into the system. That's where the problem comes in, because the guy who stayed up nights to count pieces of paper is off somewhere counting something much more valuable, and the golf playing guy believes whatever number Susan hands him and never bothers to go check.\n\nThere's where efficiency goes to die, because there are (ahem...were as of Oct 1st) thousands of government employees who are ensconced in their jobs, and are spinning their wheels toward retirement, and don't really give a shit if their work is stellar, because they'll never promote.\n\nDon't be confused- there are also many thousands of people dedicated to their jobs and are doing their part for the American people, especially at the people-facing lowest levels, where the rubber meets the road. And the top levels are filled with those people who were the best and got promoted, they do amazing things. It's the rotten middle that's often the problem. they make stupid rules to justify their own jobs, pinch some pennies and lose others, and generally just...spin their wheels a lot, as I said. Since they're so autonomous, they can fake the funk for a good long time before the ceiling caves in and all the things they've left undone see the light of day.\n\nBack to the main point- how do you improve that? Firing all those people and cutting programs won't help -it's a systemic issue. All you do is deprive the American people of that service. Sure, it'll score some politician points, but at the ground level, someone's losing some help they asked and maybe even voted for, and that sucks.\n\nThere's only one real solution- hire good administrators. Seems easy, right? Then enters politics. Some people have their jobs for reasons other than their ability to do a good job, and those people are often protected by their benefactors. At the middle high levels it can be a matter of what political party or ideology they represent, because that makes sure the 'right' rules are passed own through the organization that supports that party or ideology. \n\nThis post is a freaking novel because the problem is literally that complicated. I've worked in government at all levels for most of my working life, I've seen the inefficiency, been part of the inefficiency, and risen about the inefficiency. It's not as easy as 'kill the extra programs!' That might make the dollars and cents look better, but that doesn't make anything any more efficient, because the programs that remain still have the same problems they did before.\n\nDo I have an answer? hell no. Smarter people than me have failed to crack this nut. Just remember this though, that when someone tells you it's as simple as cutting waste or whatever...it's not, and they know it, because they're part of the system they're trying to run down.

The same goes for a more extreme example. Walmart employs ~2 million minimum wage workers. So the same wage increase would cost them ~$105 million per day. But since [Walmart makes an average of ~$36 million per hour](http://www.statisticbrain.com/wal-mart-company-statistics/) (between $504 million to $864 million per day depending on how many stores are open 24 hours), they can easily internalize this cost.

So perhaps it should be the job of the company to ensure that their product is something that people want, even when a person has to be paid a living wage to make it. \n\nThat strikes me as a lot better than companies shoveling crap at us and then making the excuse that they should be able to give their workers starvation wages because the product isn't worth it.\n\n&gt;And what, pray tell, defines a meaningful [sic]\n\nI'm assuming you meant to finish that sentence with \"contribution\". \n\nA meaningful contribution to an economy, in terms of wages, is a wage that allows a person to live free of deprivation.\n\n&gt;the millions of jobs worth less than 11 bucks an hour that you want to destroy in order to make yourself feel morally superior\n\nThis is rich.

I'll direct you (again) back to your own quote: \n\n*\"Labor is worth what everything is worth, it is based on what other people will pay for it\"*\n\n*-/u/cassander*\n\nLabor is worth what an employer decides it's worth.

What do you think their decision will be?\n\n&gt;that you want to destroy\n\nNo job is \"destroyed\" or \"created\". If there is a need for a position to exist, then it will exist. The employer will internalize the cost of having that position filled, because that's the cost of doing business. If an employer can eliminate a position and continue to meet demand, then that position was, by definition, superfluous; subject to elimination whether or not any change in minimum wage law occurred.\n\n&gt;in order to make yourself feel morally superior\n\nOh, right. Since I'm a godless, CEO-questioning pinko, I must be trying to make myself feel good about being an enemy of freedom, reality TV, and apple pie; instead of, ya know... giving a damn about my society, my country and my fellow human beings by showing concern about how they're paid and treated and whether or not they can contribute to a strong economy on the wage they're given.\n\n&gt;More than a 7 dollar employee, sure, not more than an 11 dollar one\n\nThat difference is infinitesimal. \n\n&gt;But if you don't understand how raising labor costs eventually results in technological replacement\n\nTechnological replacement happens anyway.

I'd like a link, please.\n\nThey can't and it doesn't come from anywhere. It's 100% subjective. Companies look at what their competition is paying and offer the same or a little more. That's it. If they can't afford to, they offer less and are slowly phased out of the employment market unless they catch up. \n\nThere is *no set or scientific worth for a person's labor*. If the minimum wage is $11, McDonald's will pay $11 for a cashier, or they'll close up.

Aren't institutions supposed to be for people's (and therefore society's) benefit, instead of the other way around? \n\nAlso, when you go to electronic screens, you still need attendants for them, technicians to fix them, people to count the money and tabulate the credit card receipts, factories to build them and replace them, armies of marketing people to both to supply them with pretty pictures to replace the human greeting of a cashier and to come up with ways to remind customers why they should continue patronizing a place which can't be bothered to have a human on hand to look them in the eye when they hand their money over. Then there's training costs for managers, franchisees and execs... installation, upgrades... the list goes on and on. At best, McDonald's would be breaking even after a period of years. Don't forget that everything costs money. Most things cost more than a low-wage employee.\n\nBesides, do you think that a CEO who makes as much as [James A. Skinner did in 2011](http://www.forbes.com/lists/2011/12/ceo-compensation-11_rank.html) ($20.71 million a year and $24.3 million in stock options) *really* creates that much productivity? It's fucking McDonald's for shit's sake. What is someone in charge of that company *honestly* doing to where he or she *personally* brings in enough money to be worth that kind of a yearly check? Your productivity=pay argument doesn't sound very strong for people making that much. \n\n&gt;No, [$450 a week] isn't [pocket change].\n\n&gt;You seem to think that the world of employment is composed entirely of heads of household looking for full time jobs\n\nFirst, $450 is not a lot of money. Per week, before taxes, it comes out to $1,800 per month and $21,600 a year. In other words, it represents a wage which barely exceeds a reasonable person's basic expenses. On a wage like that, you *might* be able to have some sort of a life when you're not at work and after the bills are paid. Don't forget that a basic 1 bedroom apartment is around $750-$1,000 a month in some places and not everyone has access to a pool of  roommates. So what we're talking about here is $800-$1,250 a month or $200-$312.50 a week (remember this is all *before* taxes) for someone making that much. Remember, too, that transportation and other costs rise the farther away from work someone has to live in order to find affordable housing. We're not talking about piles and piles of money here. We're talking about an amount that correlates to a basic ability to have a life of some kind. \n\nAnd as far as what a job is for, why in the world should we be making it so that people need second and third jobs? Doesn't that increase unemployment? One person, one job, one income, one tax burden. As soon as one person has to take two jobs, that's one job that someone who needs one can't have.\n\n&gt; far better that people make zero dollars than they make less than the minimum wage\n\nAh yes!

I'll direct you (again) back to your own quote: \n\n*\"Labor is worth what everything is worth, it is based on what other people will pay for it\"*\n\n*-/u/cassander*\n\nLabor is worth what an employer decides it's worth.

The employer will internalize the cost of having that position filled, because that's the cost of doing business.

Why should a business which generates poverty by paying people less that what they can live on *not* be forced out of the market if it's unwilling to keep pace with the rest of the economy?\n\n&gt;In what world do you live in where a 55% increase in costs is infinitesimal?\n\nLet's say you have a small business with 10 minimum wage employees. Right now, you're paying them $7.25 an hour, for a total cost of $72.50 an hour and since you're open from 8am-10pm each day, that's $1,015 per day. The wage goes up to $11 per hour. Now you're paying a total of $110 an hour and $1,540 per day. That's a difference of $525. If you own a business with 10 people on staff and you can't adjust in a cost-of-business increase of 525 bucks, then you run a shit business anyway, and the economy isn't losing any of it's tentpoles when you go under. The same goes for a more extreme example. Walmart employs ~2 million minimum wage workers. So the same wage increase would cost them ~$105 million per day. But since [Walmart makes an average of ~$36 million per hour](http://www.statisticbrain.com/wal-mart-company-statistics/) (between $504 million to $864 million per day depending on how many stores are open 24 hours), they can easily internalize this cost. They might decide to raise prices a bit, but that's life in the big city.\n\n&gt;I have a machine that replaces a fry cooker, but costs the equivalent of 12 dollars an hour\n\nThis is almost funny. It's not about whether the machine is cheaper, not if you care about your business' reputation and customer base. It's about whether the machine can do the job as well or better than a person can. \n\nHow many businesses do you think would stay afloat if they went to an inferior method of service to save a buck? What a smart business does is provide the best service it can, whatever that means. Like I said, paying people shit to try and make their jobs tech-proof is stupid. When the tech is better than what a person can provide, he'll be replaced, whether he makes 2 cents or $200 an hour. \n\n&gt;He shouldn't. He should be allowed to offer any work he wants for any pay he wants. But you, the guy who thinks he can plan the economy, you DO have to consider it because you aren't trying to get one job done, you're trying to plan the economy, which means finding part time work for people who want it.\n\nThis is literally an incoherent blob of nonsense. You haven't got a clue what you're talking about. People shouldn't be required to worry about offering their services for less than a living wage. Why in the world would anyone want to? How in the world is that helpful? You can't pay half your rent, or a third of your electric bill, so what's the point of a fraction of an income for a full day's work? \n\n&gt;the guy who thinks he can plan the economy\n\nAs opposed to you, the guy who thinks that the economy works best when no planning goes into it? Sure, guy. Whatever.\n\nWhy should part time work pay less per hour minimum than full time work?

No fry cook in the history of ever has negotiated his wage. It goes like this: \"You're hired. This is what we'll be paying you.\" There is no negotiating phase.

I'd like a link, please.\n\nThey can't and it doesn't come from anywhere. It's 100% subjective. Companies look at what their competition is paying and offer the same or a little more. That's it. If they can't afford to, they offer less and are slowly phased out of the employment market unless they catch up. \n\nThere is *no set or scientific worth for a person's labor*.

Aren't institutions supposed to be for people's (and therefore society's) benefit, instead of the other way around? \n\nAlso, when you go to electronic screens, you still need attendants for them, technicians to fix them, people to count the money and tabulate the credit card receipts, factories to build them and replace them, armies of marketing people to both to supply them with pretty pictures to replace the human greeting of a cashier and to come up with ways to remind customers why they should continue patronizing a place which can't be bothered to have a human on hand to look them in the eye when they hand their money over. Then there's training costs for managers, franchisees and execs... installation, upgrades... the list goes on and on. At best, McDonald's would be breaking even after a period of years. Don't forget that everything costs money. Most things cost more than a low-wage employee.\n\nBesides, do you think that a CEO who makes as much as [James A. Skinner did in 2011](http://www.forbes.com/lists/2011/12/ceo-compensation-11_rank.html) ($20.71 million a year and $24.3 million in stock options) *really* creates that much productivity? It's fucking McDonald's for shit's sake. What is someone in charge of that company *honestly* doing to where he or she *personally* brings in enough money to be worth that kind of a yearly check? Your productivity=pay argument doesn't sound very strong for people making that much. \n\n&gt;No, [$450 a week] isn't [pocket change].\n\n&gt;You seem to think that the world of employment is composed entirely of heads of household looking for full time jobs\n\nFirst, $450 is not a lot of money. Per week, before taxes, it comes out to $1,800 per month and $21,600 a year. In other words, it represents a wage which barely exceeds a reasonable person's basic expenses. On a wage like that, you *might* be able to have some sort of a life when you're not at work and after the bills are paid. Don't forget that a basic 1 bedroom apartment is around $750-$1,000 a month in some places and not everyone has access to a pool of  roommates. So what we're talking about here is $800-$1,250 a month or $200-$312.50 a week (remember this is all *before* taxes) for someone making that much. Remember, too, that transportation and other costs rise the farther away from work someone has to live in order to find affordable housing. We're not talking about piles and piles of money here. We're talking about an amount that correlates to a basic ability to have a life of some kind. \n\nAnd as far as what a job is for, why in the world should we be making it so that people need second and third jobs? Doesn't that increase unemployment? One person, one job, one income, one tax burden. As soon as one person has to take two jobs, that's one job that someone who needs one can't have.\n\n&gt; far better that people make zero dollars than they make less than the minimum wage\n\nAh yes! Bow and scrape miscreants! And thank the god we created to be your invisible teddy bear that we the owners deign to bless you with even a partial income! \n\nPoverty will be ended when money is out of government and we have a system in place which provides people with a baseline.

Why should a business which generates poverty by paying people less that what they can live on *not* be forced out of the market if it's unwilling to keep pace with the rest of the economy?\n\n&gt;In what world do you live in where a 55% increase in costs is infinitesimal?\n\nLet's say you have a small business with 10 minimum wage employees. Right now, you're paying them $7.25 an hour, for a total cost of $72.50 an hour and since you're open from 8am-10pm each day, that's $1,015 per day. The wage goes up to $11 per hour. Now you're paying a total of $110 an hour and $1,540 per day. That's a difference of $525. If you own a business with 10 people on staff and you can't adjust in a cost-of-business increase of 525 bucks, then you run a shit business anyway, and the economy isn't losing any of it's tentpoles when you go under. The same goes for a more extreme example. Walmart employs ~2 million minimum wage workers. So the same wage increase would cost them ~$105 million per day. But since [Walmart makes an average of ~$36 million per hour](http://www.statisticbrain.com/wal-mart-company-statistics/) (between $504 million to $864 million per day depending on how many stores are open 24 hours), they can easily internalize this cost. They might decide to raise prices a bit, but that's life in the big city.\n\n&gt;I have a machine that replaces a fry cooker, but costs the equivalent of 12 dollars an hour\n\nThis is almost funny. It's not about whether the machine is cheaper, not if you care about your business' reputation and customer base. It's about whether the machine can do the job as well or better than a person can. \n\nHow many businesses do you think would stay afloat if they went to an inferior method of service to save a buck? What a smart business does is provide the best service it can, whatever that means. Like I said, paying people shit to try and make their jobs tech-proof is stupid. When the tech is better than what a person can provide, he'll be replaced, whether he makes 2 cents or $200 an hour. \n\n&gt;He shouldn't. He should be allowed to offer any work he wants for any pay he wants. But you, the guy who thinks he can plan the economy, you DO have to consider it because you aren't trying to get one job done, you're trying to plan the economy, which means finding part time work for people who want it.\n\nThis is literally an incoherent blob of nonsense. You haven't got a clue what you're talking about. People shouldn't be required to worry about offering their services for less than a living wage. Why in the world would anyone want to? How in the world is that helpful? You can't pay half your rent, or a third of your electric bill, so what's the point of a fraction of an income for a full day's work? \n\n&gt;the guy who thinks he can plan the economy\n\nAs opposed to you, the guy who thinks that the economy works best when no planning goes into it? Sure, guy. Whatever.\n\nWhy should part time work pay less per hour minimum than full time work?

No fry cook in the history of ever has negotiated his wage. It goes like this: \"You're hired. This is what we'll be paying you.\" There is no negotiating phase.

I'd like a link, please.\n\nThey can't and it doesn't come from anywhere. It's 100% subjective. Companies look at what their competition is paying and offer the same or a little more. That's it. If they can't afford to, they offer less and are slowly phased out of the employment market unless they catch up. \n\nThere is *no set or scientific worth for a person's labor*.

Then there's training costs for managers, franchisees and execs... installation, upgrades... the list goes on and on. At best, McDonald's would be breaking even after a period of years. Don't forget that everything costs money. Most things cost more than a low-wage employee.\n\nBesides, do you think that a CEO who makes as much as [James A. Skinner did in 2011](http://www.forbes.com/lists/2011/12/ceo-compensation-11_rank.html) ($20.71 million a year and $24.3 million in stock options) *really* creates that much productivity? It's fucking McDonald's for shit's sake. What is someone in charge of that company *honestly* doing to where he or she *personally* brings in enough money to be worth that kind of a yearly check? Your productivity=pay argument doesn't sound very strong for people making that much. \n\n&gt;No, [$450 a week] isn't [pocket change].\n\n&gt;You seem to think that the world of employment is composed entirely of heads of household looking for full time jobs\n\nFirst, $450 is not a lot of money. Per week, before taxes, it comes out to $1,800 per month and $21,600 a year. In other words, it represents a wage which barely exceeds a reasonable person's basic expenses. On a wage like that, you *might* be able to have some sort of a life when you're not at work and after the bills are paid. Don't forget that a basic 1 bedroom apartment is around $750-$1,000 a month in some places and not everyone has access to a pool of  roommates. So what we're talking about here is $800-$1,250 a month or $200-$312.50 a week (remember this is all *before* taxes) for someone making that much. Remember, too, that transportation and other costs rise the farther away from work someone has to live in order to find affordable housing. We're not talking about piles and piles of money here. We're talking about an amount that correlates to a basic ability to have a life of some kind. \n\nAnd as far as what a job is for, why in the world should we be making it so that people need second and third jobs? Doesn't that increase unemployment? One person, one job, one income, one tax burden. As soon as one person has to take two jobs, that's one job that someone who needs one can't have.\n\n&gt; far better that people make zero dollars than they make less than the minimum wage\n\nAh yes! Bow and scrape miscreants! And thank the god we created to be your invisible teddy bear that we the owners deign to bless you with even a partial income! \n\nPoverty will be ended when money is out of government and we have a system in place which provides people with a baseline.

Why should a business which generates poverty by paying people less that what they can live on *not* be forced out of the market if it's unwilling to keep pace with the rest of the economy?\n\n&gt;In what world do you live in where a 55% increase in costs is infinitesimal?\n\nLet's say you have a small business with 10 minimum wage employees. Right now, you're paying them $7.25 an hour, for a total cost of $72.50 an hour and since you're open from 8am-10pm each day, that's $1,015 per day. The wage goes up to $11 per hour. Now you're paying a total of $110 an hour and $1,540 per day. That's a difference of $525. If you own a business with 10 people on staff and you can't adjust in a cost-of-business increase of 525 bucks, then you run a shit business anyway, and the economy isn't losing any of it's tentpoles when you go under. The same goes for a more extreme example. Walmart employs ~2 million minimum wage workers. So the same wage increase would cost them ~$105 million per day. But since [Walmart makes an average of ~$36 million per hour](http://www.statisticbrain.com/wal-mart-company-statistics/) (between $504 million to $864 million per day depending on how many stores are open 24 hours), they can easily internalize this cost. They might decide to raise prices a bit, but that's life in the big city.\n\n&gt;I have a machine that replaces a fry cooker, but costs the equivalent of 12 dollars an hour\n\nThis is almost funny. It's not about whether the machine is cheaper, not if you care about your business' reputation and customer base. It's about whether the machine can do the job as well or better than a person can. \n\nHow many businesses do you think would stay afloat if they went to an inferior method of service to save a buck? What a smart business does is provide the best service it can, whatever that means. Like I said, paying people shit to try and make their jobs tech-proof is stupid. When the tech is better than what a person can provide, he'll be replaced, whether he makes 2 cents or $200 an hour. \n\n&gt;He shouldn't. He should be allowed to offer any work he wants for any pay he wants. But you, the guy who thinks he can plan the economy, you DO have to consider it because you aren't trying to get one job done, you're trying to plan the economy, which means finding part time work for people who want it.\n\nThis is literally an incoherent blob of nonsense. You haven't got a clue what you're talking about. People shouldn't be required to worry about offering their services for less than a living wage. Why in the world would anyone want to? How in the world is that helpful? You can't pay half your rent, or a third of your electric bill, so what's the point of a fraction of an income for a full day's work? \n\n&gt;the guy who thinks he can plan the economy\n\nAs opposed to you, the guy who thinks that the economy works best when no planning goes into it? Sure, guy. Whatever.\n\nWhy should part time work pay less per hour minimum than full time work?

Then there's training costs for managers, franchisees and execs... installation, upgrades... the list goes on and on. At best, McDonald's would be breaking even after a period of years. Don't forget that everything costs money. Most things cost more than a low-wage employee.\n\nBesides, do you think that a CEO who makes as much as [James A. Skinner did in 2011](http://www.forbes.com/lists/2011/12/ceo-compensation-11_rank.html) ($20.71 million a year and $24.3 million in stock options) *really* creates that much productivity? It's fucking McDonald's for shit's sake. What is someone in charge of that company *honestly* doing to where he or she *personally* brings in enough money to be worth that kind of a yearly check? Your productivity=pay argument doesn't sound very strong for people making that much. \n\n&gt;No, [$450 a week] isn't [pocket change].\n\n&gt;You seem to think that the world of employment is composed entirely of heads of household looking for full time jobs\n\nFirst, $450 is not a lot of money. Per week, before taxes, it comes out to $1,800 per month and $21,600 a year. In other words, it represents a wage which barely exceeds a reasonable person's basic expenses. On a wage like that, you *might* be able to have some sort of a life when you're not at work and after the bills are paid. Don't forget that a basic 1 bedroom apartment is around $750-$1,000 a month in some places and not everyone has access to a pool of  roommates. So what we're talking about here is $800-$1,250 a month or $200-$312.50 a week (remember this is all *before* taxes) for someone making that much. Remember, too, that transportation and other costs rise the farther away from work someone has to live in order to find affordable housing. We're not talking about piles and piles of money here. We're talking about an amount that correlates to a basic ability to have a life of some kind. \n\nAnd as far as what a job is for, why in the world should we be making it so that people need second and third jobs? Doesn't that increase unemployment? One person, one job, one income, one tax burden. As soon as one person has to take two jobs, that's one job that someone who needs one can't have.\n\n&gt; far better that people make zero dollars than they make less than the minimum wage\n\nAh yes! Bow and scrape miscreants! And thank the god we created to be your invisible teddy bear that we the owners deign to bless you with even a partial income! \n\nPoverty will be ended when money is out of government and we have a system in place which provides people with a baseline.

What do you think their decision will be?\n\n&gt;that you want to destroy\n\nNo job is \"destroyed\" or \"created\". If there is a need for a position to exist, then it will exist. The employer will internalize the cost of having that position filled, because that's the cost of doing business. If an employer can eliminate a position and continue to meet demand, then that position was, by definition, superfluous; subject to elimination whether or not any change in minimum wage law occurred.\n\n&gt;in order to make yourself feel morally superior\n\nOh, right. Since I'm a godless, CEO-questioning pinko, I must be trying to make myself feel good about being an enemy of freedom, reality TV, and apple pie; instead of, ya know... giving a damn about my society, my country and my fellow human beings by showing concern about how they're paid and treated and whether or not they can contribute to a strong economy on the wage they're given.\n\n&gt;More than a 7 dollar employee, sure, not more than an 11 dollar one\n\nThat difference is infinitesimal. \n\n&gt;But if you don't understand how raising labor costs eventually results in technological replacement\n\nTechnological replacement happens anyway. When you can have a machine that can do something as well or better than a person, you have the machine do it. Paying people shit wages to try and make their jobs immune to technological advancement doesn't make any sense at all.\n\n\"Hey guys I invented a machine that does the work faster and more efficiently!\"\n\n\"Shh! Quiet! Put that away! They're not demanding a living wage yet!\"\n\n...said no company, ever.\n\n&gt;you never once address my point, that not every job is intended as a primary wage earner\n\nAnd? Why should a person who's working a supplementary job consider his or her time as worth less than the time of a person who needs his or her job to survive? The job doesn't change. The product doesn't change. The ability of the employer to make money doesn't change. Why should the compensation?

If big macs sold for 100 bucks, you could pay cashiers a lot more, but they don't.\n\nSo a cashier who sells electronics from Best Buy should make about 100x more than a cashier who sells fast food? After all Blu-Ray players and Playstations are much more expensive than double cheeseburgers... Right?\n\nExcept... that's *not* how it works. You really ought to think things through before you say them, sport.\n\n&gt;Exactly that, they would be forced out of the market. By your logic, why not raise the minimum wage to 100 dollars an hour? Heck, why not 1000? We'll all be millionaires!!!!\n\n...Or we could have a sensible minimum wage of $11-$15 per hour depending on the average cost of living in the area in question, and not go full retard. Why should a business which generates poverty by paying people less that what they can live on *not* be forced out of the market if it's unwilling to keep pace with the rest of the economy?\n\n&gt;In what world do you live in where a 55% increase in costs is infinitesimal?\n\nLet's say you have a small business with 10 minimum wage employees. Right now, you're paying them $7.25 an hour, for a total cost of $72.50 an hour and since you're open from 8am-10pm each day, that's $1,015 per day. The wage goes up to $11 per hour. Now you're paying a total of $110 an hour and $1,540 per day. That's a difference of $525. If you own a business with 10 people on staff and you can't adjust in a cost-of-business increase of 525 bucks, then you run a shit business anyway, and the economy isn't losing any of it's tentpoles when you go under. The same goes for a more extreme example. Walmart employs ~2 million minimum wage workers. So the same wage increase would cost them ~$105 million per day. But since [Walmart makes an average of ~$36 million per hour](http://www.statisticbrain.com/wal-mart-company-statistics/) (between $504 million to $864 million per day depending on how many stores are open 24 hours), they can easily internalize this cost. They might decide to raise prices a bit, but that's life in the big city.\n\n&gt;I have a machine that replaces a fry cooker, but costs the equivalent of 12 dollars an hour\n\nThis is almost funny. It's not about whether the machine is cheaper, not if you care about your business' reputation and customer base. It's about whether the machine can do the job as well or better than a person can. \n\nHow many businesses do you think would stay afloat if they went to an inferior method of service to save a buck? What a smart business does is provide the best service it can, whatever that means. Like I said, paying people shit to try and make their jobs tech-proof is stupid. When the tech is better than what a person can provide, he'll be replaced, whether he makes 2 cents or $200 an hour. \n\n&gt;He shouldn't. He should be allowed to offer any work he wants for any pay he wants. But you, the guy who thinks he can plan the economy, you DO have to consider it because you aren't trying to get one job done, you're trying to plan the economy, which means finding part time work for people who want it.\n\nThis is literally an incoherent blob of nonsense. You haven't got a clue what you're talking about. People shouldn't be required to worry about offering their services for less than a living wage. Why in the world would anyone want to? How in the world is that helpful? You can't pay half your rent, or a third of your electric bill, so what's the point of a fraction of an income for a full day's work? \n\n&gt;the guy who thinks he can plan the economy\n\nAs opposed to you, the guy who thinks that the economy works best when no planning goes into it? Sure, guy. Whatever.\n\nWhy should part time work pay less per hour minimum than full time work?

I'd like a link, please.\n\nThey can't and it doesn't come from anywhere. It's 100% subjective. Companies look at what their competition is paying and offer the same or a little more. That's it. If they can't afford to, they offer less and are slowly phased out of the employment market unless they catch up. \n\nThere is *no set or scientific worth for a person's labor*.

And good riddance to any company which can no longer do it's bit in the economy by paying people a meaningful wage. \n\nI think it's pretty rich that some folks will take this sink-or-swim approach to individuals but when it's a company that doesn't have the wherewithal to make a meaningful contribution, all of a sudden it's this sacred thing that has to be catered to, and anyone who suggests otherwise is a god-hating, entitled pinko. Aren't institutions supposed to be for people's (and therefore society's) benefit, instead of the other way around? \n\nAlso, when you go to electronic screens, you still need attendants for them, technicians to fix them, people to count the money and tabulate the credit card receipts, factories to build them and replace them, armies of marketing people to both to supply them with pretty pictures to replace the human greeting of a cashier and to come up with ways to remind customers why they should continue patronizing a place which can't be bothered to have a human on hand to look them in the eye when they hand their money over. Then there's training costs for managers, franchisees and execs... installation, upgrades... the list goes on and on. At best, McDonald's would be breaking even after a period of years. Don't forget that everything costs money. Most things cost more than a low-wage employee.\n\nBesides, do you think that a CEO who makes as much as [James A. Skinner did in 2011](http://www.forbes.com/lists/2011/12/ceo-compensation-11_rank.html) ($20.71 million a year and $24.3 million in stock options) *really* creates that much productivity? It's fucking McDonald's for shit's sake. What is someone in charge of that company *honestly* doing to where he or she *personally* brings in enough money to be worth that kind of a yearly check? Your productivity=pay argument doesn't sound very strong for people making that much. \n\n&gt;No, [$450 a week] isn't [pocket change].\n\n&gt;You seem to think that the world of employment is composed entirely of heads of household looking for full time jobs\n\nFirst, $450 is not a lot of money. Per week, before taxes, it comes out to $1,800 per month and $21,600 a year. In other words, it represents a wage which barely exceeds a reasonable person's basic expenses. On a wage like that, you *might* be able to have some sort of a life when you're not at work and after the bills are paid. Don't forget that a basic 1 bedroom apartment is around $750-$1,000 a month in some places and not everyone has access to a pool of  roommates. So what we're talking about here is $800-$1,250 a month or $200-$312.50 a week (remember this is all *before* taxes) for someone making that much. Remember, too, that transportation and other costs rise the farther away from work someone has to live in order to find affordable housing. We're not talking about piles and piles of money here. We're talking about an amount that correlates to a basic ability to have a life of some kind. \n\nAnd as far as what a job is for, why in the world should we be making it so that people need second and third jobs? Doesn't that increase unemployment? One person, one job, one income, one tax burden. As soon as one person has to take two jobs, that's one job that someone who needs one can't have.\n\n&gt; far better that people make zero dollars than they make less than the minimum wage\n\nAh yes! Bow and scrape miscreants! And thank the god we created to be your invisible teddy bear that we the owners deign to bless you with even a partial income! \n\nPoverty will be ended when money is out of government and we have a system in place which provides people with a baseline.

So perhaps it should be the job of the company to ensure that their product is something that people want, even when a person has to be paid a living wage to make it. \n\nThat strikes me as a lot better than companies shoveling crap at us and then making the excuse that they should be able to give their workers starvation wages because the product isn't worth it.\n\n&gt;And what, pray tell, defines a meaningful [sic]\n\nI'm assuming you meant to finish that sentence with \"contribution\". \n\nA meaningful contribution to an economy, in terms of wages, is a wage that allows a person to live free of deprivation.\n\n&gt;the millions of jobs worth less than 11 bucks an hour that you want to destroy in order to make yourself feel morally superior\n\nThis is rich. I'm going to break it down a bit.\n\n&gt;millions of jobs worth less than 11 bucks an hour\n\nAgain. There is no such thing as a job's \"worth\". There is no such thing as a person's labor's \"value\". These are fairy tale concepts that cheap employers and conservatives sling around to make themselves sound intelligent to people who don't think about things before they internalize and regurgitate them. I'll direct you (again) back to your own quote: \n\n*\"Labor is worth what everything is worth, it is based on what other people will pay for it\"*\n\n*-/u/cassander*\n\nLabor is worth what an employer decides it's worth. If the minimum wage goes up to $11, or $15, or $22; employers can decide that continuing have employees is worth it, or they can do the work themselves -- or they can always decide to stop operating a business. What do you think their decision will be?\n\n&gt;that you want to destroy\n\nNo job is \"destroyed\" or \"created\". If there is a need for a position to exist, then it will exist. The employer will internalize the cost of having that position filled, because that's the cost of doing business. If an employer can eliminate a position and continue to meet demand, then that position was, by definition, superfluous; subject to elimination whether or not any change in minimum wage law occurred.\n\n&gt;in order to make yourself feel morally superior\n\nOh, right. Since I'm a godless, CEO-questioning pinko, I must be trying to make myself feel good about being an enemy of freedom, reality TV, and apple pie; instead of, ya know... giving a damn about my society, my country and my fellow human beings by showing concern about how they're paid and treated and whether or not they can contribute to a strong economy on the wage they're given.\n\n&gt;More than a 7 dollar employee, sure, not more than an 11 dollar one\n\nThat difference is infinitesimal. \n\n&gt;But if you don't understand how raising labor costs eventually results in technological replacement\n\nTechnological replacement happens anyway. When you can have a machine that can do something as well or better than a person, you have the machine do it.

Why should a business which generates poverty by paying people less that what they can live on *not* be forced out of the market if it's unwilling to keep pace with the rest of the economy?\n\n&gt;In what world do you live in where a 55% increase in costs is infinitesimal?\n\nLet's say you have a small business with 10 minimum wage employees. Right now, you're paying them $7.25 an hour, for a total cost of $72.50 an hour and since you're open from 8am-10pm each day, that's $1,015 per day. The wage goes up to $11 per hour. Now you're paying a total of $110 an hour and $1,540 per day. That's a difference of $525. If you own a business with 10 people on staff and you can't adjust in a cost-of-business increase of 525 bucks, then you run a shit business anyway, and the economy isn't losing any of it's tentpoles when you go under. The same goes for a more extreme example. Walmart employs ~2 million minimum wage workers. So the same wage increase would cost them ~$105 million per day. But since [Walmart makes an average of ~$36 million per hour](http://www.statisticbrain.com/wal-mart-company-statistics/) (between $504 million to $864 million per day depending on how many stores are open 24 hours), they can easily internalize this cost. They might decide to raise prices a bit, but that's life in the big city.\n\n&gt;I have a machine that replaces a fry cooker, but costs the equivalent of 12 dollars an hour\n\nThis is almost funny. It's not about whether the machine is cheaper, not if you care about your business' reputation and customer base. It's about whether the machine can do the job as well or better than a person can. \n\nHow many businesses do you think would stay afloat if they went to an inferior method of service to save a buck? What a smart business does is provide the best service it can, whatever that means. Like I said, paying people shit to try and make their jobs tech-proof is stupid. When the tech is better than what a person can provide, he'll be replaced, whether he makes 2 cents or $200 an hour. \n\n&gt;He shouldn't. He should be allowed to offer any work he wants for any pay he wants. But you, the guy who thinks he can plan the economy, you DO have to consider it because you aren't trying to get one job done, you're trying to plan the economy, which means finding part time work for people who want it.\n\nThis is literally an incoherent blob of nonsense. You haven't got a clue what you're talking about. People shouldn't be required to worry about offering their services for less than a living wage. Why in the world would anyone want to? How in the world is that helpful? You can't pay half your rent, or a third of your electric bill, so what's the point of a fraction of an income for a full day's work? \n\n&gt;the guy who thinks he can plan the economy\n\nAs opposed to you, the guy who thinks that the economy works best when no planning goes into it? Sure, guy. Whatever.\n\nWhy should part time work pay less per hour minimum than full time work?

But perhaps worse, the restructuring of work\u2014the subdivision of labor into its unskilled parts\u2014left many workers with few marketable skills and little hope for occupational or social mobility. One consequence of all this was a budding labor movement, as workers banded together to try to force their collective will upon the industrial giants that had dominated them as individuals. Workers' efforts to organize frequently led to long and violent strikes, rocking the economic landscape and even raising the frightening specter of outright class warfare. http://www.shmoop.com/gilded-age/summary.html\n\nIt's fact.  Unions did not come out of nowhere.\n\n&gt; this talking point has been around for years and is completely idiotic. the financial crisis started in pure investment banks, not hybrids, and was ended when the hybrids bought out the investment banks. the only think you can say about GLB is that it made the crisis LESS bad.\n\n&gt; it did no such thing. can you even tell me what GLB did, without looking it up? Or how many other countries had a similar law to glass steagall?\n\nI don't appreciate the condescending quiz, but it allowed for consolidation of financial services entities.  That is a form of deregulation because it allowed companies to act in ways that they had not been allowed to act since the great depression.  The rebranding of this as a form of regulation of the financial industry is what is completely ridiculous.  It is apparent right now that the financial services industry has a huge amount of influence in Washington and can pretty much shape regulation in the way it wants.  Regardless, GLB was a form of deregulation and allowed unprecedented consolidation in banking.\n\n&gt; implementation began in 2004.\n\nimplementation was being discussed in 2004.\n\n&gt; i didn't say it was.

Industrial wages were low and hours were long in factories that were typically dangerous and unhealthy. But perhaps worse, the restructuring of work\u2014the subdivision of labor into its unskilled parts\u2014left many workers with few marketable skills and little hope for occupational or social mobility. One consequence of all this was a budding labor movement, as workers banded together to try to force their collective will upon the industrial giants that had dominated them as individuals.

We're talking about how efficient Medicare is and their administrative costs.  You somehow want to include in their administrative overhead 20% of the cost of complying with the entire tax code, almost all of which has nothing to do with Medicare and FICA taxes (certainly not 20%).  With or without Medicare, those tax compliance costs would exist.  You're applying a political argument to an accounting one.  It's about as intellectually dishonest as it gets.\n\n&gt; so when you leave out lots of the cost, costs are really low? amazing!\n\nWhen you leave out the administrative costs and inefficiencies generated by the private plans in Medicare, and just analyze the public plans, yes, costs get low.  It's almost as this is because the private plans are less efficient.  Gasp!\n\n&gt; um, what? 110 billion out of 800 is about 14%.\n\n1.5-2% overhead is $12-16 billion, plus $60 billion in fraud is $72-76 billion is 9.0-9.5%.  This is the overhead of the public plan (I believe Medicare Part A and maybe B).\n\n&gt; it is as likely that the 60 billion is an underestimate as an overestimate. the senate finance committee[1] says between 20 and 100 billion.\n\nIs that the range that one report found, or the range over a bunch of different reports?  It sounds like the latter, in which cause you cannot assume that represents some confidence interval where $60 billion is the median.  The fact is, from what I've seen, there is little rigor in the analysis behind these numbers, mostly based on assumptions.\n\n*Edit: To point, you claim the range of fraud in Medicare is 20 to 100 billion, while the FBI reported there is only 80 billion in total medical fraud a year.  There's barely any accuracy to these numbers, making any cross report comparisons meaningless (i.e. 60 billion vs 80 billion total).*\n\n&gt; no it isn't. the private companies in medicare advantage still have the burden of collections.\n\nWe've been over this, collections from the IRS are included in Medicare's administrative costs, so it'd still be an accurate comparison.\n\n&gt; Medicare advantage has all the disadvantages of traditional medicare PLUS those of private insurers. no wonder it is inefficient.\n\nIt actually operates fairly identically to the public part of Medicare.  If you'd actually read this [paper](http://institute.ourfuture.org/files/Jacob_Hacker_Public_Plan_Choice.pdf) I keep citing:\n\n&gt; However, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has \nfound that administrative costs under the public Medicare plan are less than 2 percent of \nexpenditures, compared with approximately 11 percent of spending by private plans under \nMedicare Advantage.16 This is a near perfect \u201capples to apples\u201d comparison of \nadministrative costs, because the public Medicare plan and Medicare Advantage plans are \noperating under similar rules and treating the same population.\n \n&gt; (And even these numbers may unduly favor private plans: A recent General \nAccounting Office report found that in 2006 Medicare Advantage plans spent 83.3 percent \nof their revenue on medical expenses, with 10.1 percent going to non-medical expenses and \n6.6 percent to profits\u2014a 16.7 percent administrative share.)17\n\nThey're as close as a comparisons as you're going to get, and the public plans have around 2% overhead compared to 11-16.7% that private plans have.  \n\n&gt; i made a small mistake in my math. that is all. You, by contrast, continue to deny legal reality because it suits your ideology to do so.\n\nYou have consistently gotten even the most basic of facts wrong, and even when faced with the data to prove you wrong, you just bury your head in the sand.  And the fact that you think a semantic political definition somehow alters reality is mind boggling.\n\nI challenge you this: on actual logical merits, argue for me why tax code compliance costs that are *completely* unrelated to how Medicare operates, should somehow be included in their administrative costs?

We're talking about how efficient Medicare is and their administrative costs.  You somehow want to include in their administrative overhead 20% of the cost of complying with the entire tax code, almost all of which has nothing to do with Medicare and FICA taxes (certainly not 20%).  With or without Medicare, those tax compliance costs would exist.  You're applying a political argument to an accounting one.  It's about as intellectually dishonest as it gets.\n\n&gt; so when you leave out lots of the cost, costs are really low? amazing!\n\nWhen you leave out the administrative costs and inefficiencies generated by the private plans in Medicare, and just analyze the public plans, yes, costs get low.  It's almost as this is because the private plans are less efficient.  Gasp!\n\n&gt; um, what? 110 billion out of 800 is about 14%.\n\n1.5-2% overhead is $12-16 billion, plus $60 billion in fraud is $72-76 billion is 9.0-9.5%.  This is the overhead of the public plan (I believe Medicare Part A and maybe B).\n\n&gt; it is as likely that the 60 billion is an underestimate as an overestimate. the senate finance committee[1] says between 20 and 100 billion.\n\nIs that the range that one report found, or the range over a bunch of different reports?  It sounds like the latter, in which cause you cannot assume that represents some confidence interval where $60 billion is the median.  The fact is, from what I've seen, there is little rigor in the analysis behind these numbers, mostly based on assumptions.\n\n*Edit: To point, you claim the range of fraud in Medicare is 20 to 100 billion, while the FBI reported there is only 80 billion in total medical fraud a year.  There's barely any accuracy to these numbers, making any cross report comparisons meaningless (i.e. 60 billion vs 80 billion total).*\n\n&gt; no it isn't. the private companies in medicare advantage still have the burden of collections.\n\nWe've been over this, collections from the IRS are included in Medicare's administrative costs, so it'd still be an accurate comparison.\n\n&gt; Medicare advantage has all the disadvantages of traditional medicare PLUS those of private insurers. no wonder it is inefficient.\n\nIt actually operates fairly identically to the public part of Medicare.  If you'd actually read this [paper](http://institute.ourfuture.org/files/Jacob_Hacker_Public_Plan_Choice.pdf) I keep citing:\n\n&gt; However, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has \nfound that administrative costs under the public Medicare plan are less than 2 percent of \nexpenditures, compared with approximately 11 percent of spending by private plans under \nMedicare Advantage.16 This is a near perfect \u201capples to apples\u201d comparison of \nadministrative costs, because the public Medicare plan and Medicare Advantage plans are \noperating under similar rules and treating the same population.\n \n&gt; (And even these numbers may unduly favor private plans: A recent General \nAccounting Office report found that in 2006 Medicare Advantage plans spent 83.3 percent \nof their revenue on medical expenses, with 10.1 percent going to non-medical expenses and \n6.6 percent to profits\u2014a 16.7 percent administrative share.)17\n\nThey're as close as a comparisons as you're going to get, and the public plans have around 2% overhead compared to 11-16.7% that private plans have.  \n\n&gt; i made a small mistake in my math. that is all. You, by contrast, continue to deny legal reality because it suits your ideology to do so.\n\nYou have consistently gotten even the most basic of facts wrong, and even when faced with the data to prove you wrong, you just bury your head in the sand.  And the fact that you think a semantic political definition somehow alters reality is mind boggling.\n\nI challenge you this: on actual logical merits, argue for me why tax code compliance costs that are *completely* unrelated to how Medicare operates, should somehow be included in their administrative costs?

Please.  If you were being intellectually honest at all you'd see how pathetic this argument is.

They're done as a percent of total expenditure, as can be seen in almost any graph, article or paper that discusses this issue.  It was even directly laid out in the heritage article you posted, do you not read your own sources?\n\nFixing these two glaringly inaccurate parts, you get to around 9.0-9.5% overhead, still less than the 12-17% reported for private insurance.  And this is making the most generous assumptions one can, i.e. that the $60 billion figure is accurate and not an overestimate and that private insurance has $0 fraud.\n\n&gt; then you have to add the cost of tax compliance on top of that. \n\nWhich you've yet to show is a large burden at all, or how it compares with the burden compliance with private insurance costs.  Until you can produce reliable figures citing this, this argument is bunk.\n\n&gt; Of course, then there is the further issue of patient pools. medicare beneficiaries consume much more healthcare than everyone else, because they are old. if you look at admin costs per patient, instead of per healthcare dollar, medicare is worse than private companies.\n\nIf this were true than you'd expect to see the private plans in Medicare have about the same administrative costs, but they don't.  As shown above and repeated often, [Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D have around 11% overhead verses the 2% that the public Medicare plan has](http://institute.ourfuture.org/files/Jacob_Hacker_Public_Plan_Choice.pdf).

None of this actually tries to make comparisons between private and public fraud, as you alluded to.\n\n&gt; no, you ignoring the actual legalities of FICA Is dishonest, like the people who claim that SS doesn't add to the deficit because of the payroll tax. those costs are born in part to pay for medicare. you cannot leave them out.\n\nShow me before and after tax compliance costs with and without Medicare/FICA.  THAT is the only honest cost that can be attributed to administrative costs for Medicare.  Anything else is lying and intellectually dishonest.  The fact that the US has an extremely convoluted and complex tax code is not the fault of Medicare.  Even if you wiped out Medicare and FICA, the compliance costs in an actual dollar terms would stay almost completely the same.  Unless you can prove otherwise, you're argument is just plain out wrong.\n\nAccording to you, if the Supreme Court ruled that water was dry, that'd be all the proof you'd need that water wasn't wet.

They are *completely* separate issues when it comes to accounting.\n\n&gt; only when you leave out the services provided by other government agencies.\n\nI don't know how many times I have to repeat this to you, but [services provided by other departments](http://jhppl.dukejournals.org/content/early/2013/02/11/03616878-2079523.abstract) are included in the administrative costs.  Bottom line is the public plans have 2% administrative costs when compared to the 11-17% incurred by both private plans in Medicare and private insurance.\n\n&gt; if you read the report that that statistic comes from, the fbi says 80 billion is the low end estimate, the number they cite is 80-200, iirc.\n\nThe link you provided had two paragraphs with no citations, do you have a link to the actual study?

You could abolish FICA tomorrow, and medicare would still make payments. \n\nWhich is, again, irrelevant to the discussion at hand.  FICA currently *does* provide funds for Medicare, and the tax compliance for FICA is very very low.\n\n&gt; but since the government needs to raise money somehow, and that creates real costs, any analysis of medicare's costs need to include the cost of taxation. Since none of the taxes are legally linked to medicare, the only fair way to assess the program is looking at its share of total costs of tax collection.\n\nNo, that's almost the most unfair way to assess the program.  The fair way to asses the program is to compare cost of tax compliance with and without Medicare; this includes FICA taxes, as they are part of Medicare.  This difference is the only thing that can be assigned to administrative costs for Medicare.  The fact is that the tax code would be just as complicated whether or not Medicare exists, and would cost the same to comply with.  The fact you're trying to assign these completely irrelevant costs to Medicare administrative costs is just intellectually dishonest.\n\nBottom line is you just don't have *any* data to back your claim, you're grasping at straws.   \n\nEdit: You *really* need to read this [paper](http://jhppl.dukejournals.org/content/early/2013/02/11/03616878-2079523.abstract) I've linked to repeatedly.

We're talking about how efficient Medicare is and their administrative costs.  You somehow want to include in their administrative overhead 20% of the cost of complying with the entire tax code, almost all of which has nothing to do with Medicare and FICA taxes (certainly not 20%).  With or without Medicare, those tax compliance costs would exist.  You're applying a political argument to an accounting one.  It's about as intellectually dishonest as it gets.\n\n&gt; so when you leave out lots of the cost, costs are really low? amazing!\n\nWhen you leave out the administrative costs and inefficiencies generated by the private plans in Medicare, and just analyze the public plans, yes, costs get low.  It's almost as this is because the private plans are less efficient.  Gasp!\n\n&gt; um, what? 110 billion out of 800 is about 14%.\n\n1.5-2% overhead is $12-16 billion, plus $60 billion in fraud is $72-76 billion is 9.0-9.5%.  This is the overhead of the public plan (I believe Medicare Part A and maybe B).\n\n&gt; it is as likely that the 60 billion is an underestimate as an overestimate. the senate finance committee[1] says between 20 and 100 billion.\n\nIs that the range that one report found, or the range over a bunch of different reports?  It sounds like the latter, in which cause you cannot assume that represents some confidence interval where $60 billion is the median.  The fact is, from what I've seen, there is little rigor in the analysis behind these numbers, mostly based on assumptions.\n\n*Edit: To point, you claim the range of fraud in Medicare is 20 to 100 billion, while the FBI reported there is only 80 billion in total medical fraud a year.  There's barely any accuracy to these numbers, making any cross report comparisons meaningless (i.e. 60 billion vs 80 billion total).*\n\n&gt; no it isn't. the private companies in medicare advantage still have the burden of collections.\n\nWe've been over this, collections from the IRS are included in Medicare's administrative costs, so it'd still be an accurate comparison.\n\n&gt; Medicare advantage has all the disadvantages of traditional medicare PLUS those of private insurers. no wonder it is inefficient.\n\nIt actually operates fairly identically to the public part of Medicare.  If you'd actually read this [paper](http://institute.ourfuture.org/files/Jacob_Hacker_Public_Plan_Choice.pdf) I keep citing:\n\n&gt; However, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has \nfound that administrative costs under the public Medicare plan are less than 2 percent of \nexpenditures, compared with approximately 11 percent of spending by private plans under \nMedicare Advantage.16 This is a near perfect \u201capples to apples\u201d comparison of \nadministrative costs, because the public Medicare plan and Medicare Advantage plans are \noperating under similar rules and treating the same population.\n \n&gt; (And even these numbers may unduly favor private plans: A recent General \nAccounting Office report found that in 2006 Medicare Advantage plans spent 83.3 percent \nof their revenue on medical expenses, with 10.1 percent going to non-medical expenses and \n6.6 percent to profits\u2014a 16.7 percent administrative share.)17\n\nThey're as close as a comparisons as you're going to get, and the public plans have around 2% overhead compared to 11-16.7% that private plans have.  \n\n&gt; i made a small mistake in my math. that is all. You, by contrast, continue to deny legal reality because it suits your ideology to do so.\n\nYou have consistently gotten even the most basic of facts wrong, and even when faced with the data to prove you wrong, you just bury your head in the sand.  And the fact that you think a semantic political definition somehow alters reality is mind boggling.\n\nI challenge you this: on actual logical merits, argue for me why tax code compliance costs that are *completely* unrelated to how Medicare operates, should somehow be included in their administrative costs?

The specific cost of fica vs. income taxes is irrelevant, because legally, what source the income is from is irrelevant.\n\nWe're talking accounting, and you're trying to use a *legal* argument to back your case?  Just laughable.  Somehow the fact that the US tax code is riddled with exemptions and loopholes requiring higher compliance costs is somehow supposed to be counted towards Medicare overhead?  Please.  If you were being intellectually honest at all you'd see how pathetic this argument is.  Until you can show how much cost tax compliance with FICA is, you don't have an argument.\n\n&gt; medicare/caid's administrative costs are usually cited at 6%. \n\nThose figures that cite 6% either include the private plans in Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D, or were unaware that cost collection from the IRS and other services are included in the original figures, and thus double count when \"recalculating\".  When looking at just the public plans, as reported in the trustees report, you get [closer to around 1.5-2.0%](http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Mcare-admin.jpg).\n\n&gt; then we should count that as part of administrative expenses, not care. so instead of spending 750 billion on healthcare and 50 on admin, they spend 110 billion on admin and spend 690 on healthcare. that's an admin ratio of 16% right there.\n\nAfter all this discussion and you don't even know how administrative costs are calculated? They're done as a percent of total expenditure, as can be seen in almost any graph, article or paper that discusses this issue.  It was even directly laid out in the heritage article you posted, do you not read your own sources?\n\nFixing these two glaringly inaccurate parts, you get to around 9.0-9.5% overhead, still less than the 12-17% reported for private insurance.  And this is making the most generous assumptions one can, i.e. that the $60 billion figure is accurate and not an overestimate and that private insurance has $0 fraud.\n\n&gt; then you have to add the cost of tax compliance on top of that. \n\nWhich you've yet to show is a large burden at all, or how it compares with the burden compliance with private insurance costs.  Until you can produce reliable figures citing this, this argument is bunk.\n\n&gt; Of course, then there is the further issue of patient pools. medicare beneficiaries consume much more healthcare than everyone else, because they are old. if you look at admin costs per patient, instead of per healthcare dollar, medicare is worse than private companies.\n\nIf this were true than you'd expect to see the private plans in Medicare have about the same administrative costs, but they don't.  As shown above and repeated often, [Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D have around 11% overhead verses the 2% that the public Medicare plan has](http://institute.ourfuture.org/files/Jacob_Hacker_Public_Plan_Choice.pdf).  This is as apples-to-apples comparison you can get and there is a large difference.\n\nBased on the amount of basic mistakes you're (repeatedly) making, please read up on the area instead of relying on Heritage Foundation for your facts.

We're talking about how efficient Medicare is and their administrative costs.  You somehow want to include in their administrative overhead 20% of the cost of complying with the entire tax code, almost all of which has nothing to do with Medicare and FICA taxes (certainly not 20%).  With or without Medicare, those tax compliance costs would exist.  You're applying a political argument to an accounting one.  It's about as intellectually dishonest as it gets.\n\n&gt; so when you leave out lots of the cost, costs are really low? amazing!\n\nWhen you leave out the administrative costs and inefficiencies generated by the private plans in Medicare, and just analyze the public plans, yes, costs get low.  It's almost as this is because the private plans are less efficient.  Gasp!\n\n&gt; um, what? 110 billion out of 800 is about 14%.\n\n1.5-2% overhead is $12-16 billion, plus $60 billion in fraud is $72-76 billion is 9.0-9.5%.  This is the overhead of the public plan (I believe Medicare Part A and maybe B).\n\n&gt; it is as likely that the 60 billion is an underestimate as an overestimate. the senate finance committee[1] says between 20 and 100 billion.\n\nIs that the range that one report found, or the range over a bunch of different reports?  It sounds like the latter, in which cause you cannot assume that represents some confidence interval where $60 billion is the median.  The fact is, from what I've seen, there is little rigor in the analysis behind these numbers, mostly based on assumptions.\n\n*Edit: To point, you claim the range of fraud in Medicare is 20 to 100 billion, while the FBI reported there is only 80 billion in total medical fraud a year.  There's barely any accuracy to these numbers, making any cross report comparisons meaningless (i.e. 60 billion vs 80 billion total).*\n\n&gt; no it isn't. the private companies in medicare advantage still have the burden of collections.\n\nWe've been over this, collections from the IRS are included in Medicare's administrative costs, so it'd still be an accurate comparison.\n\n&gt; Medicare advantage has all the disadvantages of traditional medicare PLUS those of private insurers. no wonder it is inefficient.\n\nIt actually operates fairly identically to the public part of Medicare.  If you'd actually read this [paper](http://institute.ourfuture.org/files/Jacob_Hacker_Public_Plan_Choice.pdf) I keep citing:\n\n&gt; However, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has \nfound that administrative costs under the public Medicare plan are less than 2 percent of \nexpenditures, compared with approximately 11 percent of spending by private plans under \nMedicare Advantage.16 This is a near perfect \u201capples to apples\u201d comparison of \nadministrative costs, because the public Medicare plan and Medicare Advantage plans are \noperating under similar rules and treating the same population.\n \n&gt; (And even these numbers may unduly favor private plans: A recent General \nAccounting Office report found that in 2006 Medicare Advantage plans spent 83.3 percent \nof their revenue on medical expenses, with 10.1 percent going to non-medical expenses and \n6.6 percent to profits\u2014a 16.7 percent administrative share.)17\n\nThey're as close as a comparisons as you're going to get, and the public plans have around 2% overhead compared to 11-16.7% that private plans have.  \n\n&gt; i made a small mistake in my math. that is all. You, by contrast, continue to deny legal reality because it suits your ideology to do so.\n\nYou have consistently gotten even the most basic of facts wrong, and even when faced with the data to prove you wrong, you just bury your head in the sand.  And the fact that you think a semantic political definition somehow alters reality is mind boggling.\n\nI challenge you this: on actual logical merits, argue for me why tax code compliance costs that are *completely* unrelated to how Medicare operates, should somehow be included in their administrative costs?

Just laughable.  Somehow the fact that the US tax code is riddled with exemptions and loopholes requiring higher compliance costs is somehow supposed to be counted towards Medicare overhead?  Please.  If you were being intellectually honest at all you'd see how pathetic this argument is.  Until you can show how much cost tax compliance with FICA is, you don't have an argument.\n\n&gt; medicare/caid's administrative costs are usually cited at 6%. \n\nThose figures that cite 6% either include the private plans in Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D, or were unaware that cost collection from the IRS and other services are included in the original figures, and thus double count when \"recalculating\".  When looking at just the public plans, as reported in the trustees report, you get [closer to around 1.5-2.0%](http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Mcare-admin.jpg).\n\n&gt; then we should count that as part of administrative expenses, not care. so instead of spending 750 billion on healthcare and 50 on admin, they spend 110 billion on admin and spend 690 on healthcare. that's an admin ratio of 16% right there.\n\nAfter all this discussion and you don't even know how administrative costs are calculated? They're done as a percent of total expenditure, as can be seen in almost any graph, article or paper that discusses this issue.  It was even directly laid out in the heritage article you posted, do you not read your own sources?\n\nFixing these two glaringly inaccurate parts, you get to around 9.0-9.5% overhead, still less than the 12-17% reported for private insurance.  And this is making the most generous assumptions one can, i.e. that the $60 billion figure is accurate and not an overestimate and that private insurance has $0 fraud.\n\n&gt; then you have to add the cost of tax compliance on top of that. \n\nWhich you've yet to show is a large burden at all, or how it compares with the burden compliance with private insurance costs.  Until you can produce reliable figures citing this, this argument is bunk.\n\n&gt; Of course, then there is the further issue of patient pools. medicare beneficiaries consume much more healthcare than everyone else, because they are old. if you look at admin costs per patient, instead of per healthcare dollar, medicare is worse than private companies.\n\nIf this were true than you'd expect to see the private plans in Medicare have about the same administrative costs, but they don't.  As shown above and repeated often, [Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D have around 11% overhead verses the 2% that the public Medicare plan has](http://institute.ourfuture.org/files/Jacob_Hacker_Public_Plan_Choice.pdf).

We're talking about how efficient Medicare is and their administrative costs.  You somehow want to include in their administrative overhead 20% of the cost of complying with the entire tax code, almost all of which has nothing to do with Medicare and FICA taxes (certainly not 20%).  With or without Medicare, those tax compliance costs would exist.  You're applying a political argument to an accounting one.  It's about as intellectually dishonest as it gets.\n\n&gt; so when you leave out lots of the cost, costs are really low? amazing!\n\nWhen you leave out the administrative costs and inefficiencies generated by the private plans in Medicare, and just analyze the public plans, yes, costs get low.  It's almost as this is because the private plans are less efficient.  Gasp!\n\n&gt; um, what? 110 billion out of 800 is about 14%.\n\n1.5-2% overhead is $12-16 billion, plus $60 billion in fraud is $72-76 billion is 9.0-9.5%.  This is the overhead of the public plan (I believe Medicare Part A and maybe B).\n\n&gt; it is as likely that the 60 billion is an underestimate as an overestimate. the senate finance committee[1] says between 20 and 100 billion.\n\nIs that the range that one report found, or the range over a bunch of different reports?  It sounds like the latter, in which cause you cannot assume that represents some confidence interval where $60 billion is the median.  The fact is, from what I've seen, there is little rigor in the analysis behind these numbers, mostly based on assumptions.\n\n*Edit: To point, you claim the range of fraud in Medicare is 20 to 100 billion, while the FBI reported there is only 80 billion in total medical fraud a year.  There's barely any accuracy to these numbers, making any cross report comparisons meaningless (i.e. 60 billion vs 80 billion total).*\n\n&gt; no it isn't. the private companies in medicare advantage still have the burden of collections.\n\nWe've been over this, collections from the IRS are included in Medicare's administrative costs, so it'd still be an accurate comparison.\n\n&gt; Medicare advantage has all the disadvantages of traditional medicare PLUS those of private insurers. no wonder it is inefficient.\n\nIt actually operates fairly identically to the public part of Medicare.  If you'd actually read this [paper](http://institute.ourfuture.org/files/Jacob_Hacker_Public_Plan_Choice.pdf) I keep citing:\n\n&gt; However, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has \nfound that administrative costs under the public Medicare plan are less than 2 percent of \nexpenditures, compared with approximately 11 percent of spending by private plans under \nMedicare Advantage.16 This is a near perfect \u201capples to apples\u201d comparison of \nadministrative costs, because the public Medicare plan and Medicare Advantage plans are \noperating under similar rules and treating the same population.\n \n&gt; (And even these numbers may unduly favor private plans: A recent General \nAccounting Office report found that in 2006 Medicare Advantage plans spent 83.3 percent \nof their revenue on medical expenses, with 10.1 percent going to non-medical expenses and \n6.6 percent to profits\u2014a 16.7 percent administrative share.)17\n\nThey're as close as a comparisons as you're going to get, and the public plans have around 2% overhead compared to 11-16.7% that private plans have.  \n\n&gt; i made a small mistake in my math. that is all. You, by contrast, continue to deny legal reality because it suits your ideology to do so.\n\nYou have consistently gotten even the most basic of facts wrong, and even when faced with the data to prove you wrong, you just bury your head in the sand.  And the fact that you think a semantic political definition somehow alters reality is mind boggling.\n\nI challenge you this: on actual logical merits, argue for me why tax code compliance costs that are *completely* unrelated to how Medicare operates, should somehow be included in their administrative costs?

The specific cost of fica vs. income taxes is irrelevant, because legally, what source the income is from is irrelevant.\n\nWe're talking accounting, and you're trying to use a *legal* argument to back your case?  Just laughable.  Somehow the fact that the US tax code is riddled with exemptions and loopholes requiring higher compliance costs is somehow supposed to be counted towards Medicare overhead?  Please.  If you were being intellectually honest at all you'd see how pathetic this argument is.  Until you can show how much cost tax compliance with FICA is, you don't have an argument.\n\n&gt; medicare/caid's administrative costs are usually cited at 6%. \n\nThose figures that cite 6% either include the private plans in Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D, or were unaware that cost collection from the IRS and other services are included in the original figures, and thus double count when \"recalculating\".  When looking at just the public plans, as reported in the trustees report, you get [closer to around 1.5-2.0%](http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Mcare-admin.jpg).\n\n&gt; then we should count that as part of administrative expenses, not care. so instead of spending 750 billion on healthcare and 50 on admin, they spend 110 billion on admin and spend 690 on healthcare. that's an admin ratio of 16% right there.\n\nAfter all this discussion and you don't even know how administrative costs are calculated? They're done as a percent of total expenditure, as can be seen in almost any graph, article or paper that discusses this issue.  It was even directly laid out in the heritage article you posted, do you not read your own sources?\n\nFixing these two glaringly inaccurate parts, you get to around 9.0-9.5% overhead, still less than the 12-17% reported for private insurance.  And this is making the most generous assumptions one can, i.e. that the $60 billion figure is accurate and not an overestimate and that private insurance has $0 fraud.\n\n&gt; then you have to add the cost of tax compliance on top of that. \n\nWhich you've yet to show is a large burden at all, or how it compares with the burden compliance with private insurance costs.  Until you can produce reliable figures citing this, this argument is bunk.\n\n&gt; Of course, then there is the further issue of patient pools. medicare beneficiaries consume much more healthcare than everyone else, because they are old. if you look at admin costs per patient, instead of per healthcare dollar, medicare is worse than private companies.\n\nIf this were true than you'd expect to see the private plans in Medicare have about the same administrative costs, but they don't.  As shown above and repeated often, [Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D have around 11% overhead verses the 2% that the public Medicare plan has](http://institute.ourfuture.org/files/Jacob_Hacker_Public_Plan_Choice.pdf).  This is as apples-to-apples comparison you can get and there is a large difference.\n\nBased on the amount of basic mistakes you're (repeatedly) making, please read up on the area instead of relying on Heritage Foundation for your facts.

We're talking about how efficient Medicare is and their administrative costs.  You somehow want to include in their administrative overhead 20% of the cost of complying with the entire tax code, almost all of which has nothing to do with Medicare and FICA taxes (certainly not 20%).  With or without Medicare, those tax compliance costs would exist.  You're applying a political argument to an accounting one.  It's about as intellectually dishonest as it gets.\n\n&gt; so when you leave out lots of the cost, costs are really low? amazing!\n\nWhen you leave out the administrative costs and inefficiencies generated by the private plans in Medicare, and just analyze the public plans, yes, costs get low.  It's almost as this is because the private plans are less efficient.  Gasp!\n\n&gt; um, what? 110 billion out of 800 is about 14%.\n\n1.5-2% overhead is $12-16 billion, plus $60 billion in fraud is $72-76 billion is 9.0-9.5%.  This is the overhead of the public plan (I believe Medicare Part A and maybe B).\n\n&gt; it is as likely that the 60 billion is an underestimate as an overestimate. the senate finance committee[1] says between 20 and 100 billion.\n\nIs that the range that one report found, or the range over a bunch of different reports?  It sounds like the latter, in which cause you cannot assume that represents some confidence interval where $60 billion is the median.  The fact is, from what I've seen, there is little rigor in the analysis behind these numbers, mostly based on assumptions.\n\n*Edit: To point, you claim the range of fraud in Medicare is 20 to 100 billion, while the FBI reported there is only 80 billion in total medical fraud a year.  There's barely any accuracy to these numbers, making any cross report comparisons meaningless (i.e. 60 billion vs 80 billion total).*\n\n&gt; no it isn't. the private companies in medicare advantage still have the burden of collections.\n\nWe've been over this, collections from the IRS are included in Medicare's administrative costs, so it'd still be an accurate comparison.\n\n&gt; Medicare advantage has all the disadvantages of traditional medicare PLUS those of private insurers. no wonder it is inefficient.\n\nIt actually operates fairly identically to the public part of Medicare.  If you'd actually read this [paper](http://institute.ourfuture.org/files/Jacob_Hacker_Public_Plan_Choice.pdf) I keep citing:\n\n&gt; However, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has \nfound that administrative costs under the public Medicare plan are less than 2 percent of \nexpenditures, compared with approximately 11 percent of spending by private plans under \nMedicare Advantage.16 This is a near perfect \u201capples to apples\u201d comparison of \nadministrative costs, because the public Medicare plan and Medicare Advantage plans are \noperating under similar rules and treating the same population.\n \n&gt; (And even these numbers may unduly favor private plans: A recent General \nAccounting Office report found that in 2006 Medicare Advantage plans spent 83.3 percent \nof their revenue on medical expenses, with 10.1 percent going to non-medical expenses and \n6.6 percent to profits\u2014a 16.7 percent administrative share.)17\n\nThey're as close as a comparisons as you're going to get, and the public plans have around 2% overhead compared to 11-16.7% that private plans have.  \n\n&gt; i made a small mistake in my math. that is all. You, by contrast, continue to deny legal reality because it suits your ideology to do so.\n\nYou have consistently gotten even the most basic of facts wrong, and even when faced with the data to prove you wrong, you just bury your head in the sand.  And the fact that you think a semantic political definition somehow alters reality is mind boggling.\n\nI challenge you this: on actual logical merits, argue for me why tax code compliance costs that are *completely* unrelated to how Medicare operates, should somehow be included in their administrative costs?

Just laughable.  Somehow the fact that the US tax code is riddled with exemptions and loopholes requiring higher compliance costs is somehow supposed to be counted towards Medicare overhead?  Please.  If you were being intellectually honest at all you'd see how pathetic this argument is.  Until you can show how much cost tax compliance with FICA is, you don't have an argument.\n\n&gt; medicare/caid's administrative costs are usually cited at 6%. \n\nThose figures that cite 6% either include the private plans in Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D, or were unaware that cost collection from the IRS and other services are included in the original figures, and thus double count when \"recalculating\".  When looking at just the public plans, as reported in the trustees report, you get [closer to around 1.5-2.0%](http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Mcare-admin.jpg).\n\n&gt; then we should count that as part of administrative expenses, not care. so instead of spending 750 billion on healthcare and 50 on admin, they spend 110 billion on admin and spend 690 on healthcare. that's an admin ratio of 16% right there.\n\nAfter all this discussion and you don't even know how administrative costs are calculated? They're done as a percent of total expenditure, as can be seen in almost any graph, article or paper that discusses this issue.  It was even directly laid out in the heritage article you posted, do you not read your own sources?\n\nFixing these two glaringly inaccurate parts, you get to around 9.0-9.5% overhead, still less than the 12-17% reported for private insurance.  And this is making the most generous assumptions one can, i.e. that the $60 billion figure is accurate and not an overestimate and that private insurance has $0 fraud.\n\n&gt; then you have to add the cost of tax compliance on top of that. \n\nWhich you've yet to show is a large burden at all, or how it compares with the burden compliance with private insurance costs.  Until you can produce reliable figures citing this, this argument is bunk.\n\n&gt; Of course, then there is the further issue of patient pools. medicare beneficiaries consume much more healthcare than everyone else, because they are old. if you look at admin costs per patient, instead of per healthcare dollar, medicare is worse than private companies.\n\nIf this were true than you'd expect to see the private plans in Medicare have about the same administrative costs, but they don't.  As shown above and repeated often, [Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D have around 11% overhead verses the 2% that the public Medicare plan has](http://institute.ourfuture.org/files/Jacob_Hacker_Public_Plan_Choice.pdf).

If you want the actual PDF, just ask, but I won't hold my breath, as the paper pretty much contradicts everything you've said.\n\n&gt; i did, can't seem to find it. but here it is[1] referenced in the new england journal of medicine.\n\nThat just reiterates the same $60 billion figure from the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association, which has almost no actual analysis, and the rest of the article seems to refer to \"improper payments\".  None of this actually tries to make comparisons between private and public fraud, as you alluded to.\n\n&gt; no, you ignoring the actual legalities of FICA Is dishonest, like the people who claim that SS doesn't add to the deficit because of the payroll tax. those costs are born in part to pay for medicare. you cannot leave them out.\n\nShow me before and after tax compliance costs with and without Medicare/FICA.  THAT is the only honest cost that can be attributed to administrative costs for Medicare.  Anything else is lying and intellectually dishonest.  The fact that the US has an extremely convoluted and complex tax code is not the fault of Medicare.  Even if you wiped out Medicare and FICA, the compliance costs in an actual dollar terms would stay almost completely the same.  Unless you can prove otherwise, you're argument is just plain out wrong.\n\nAccording to you, if the Supreme Court ruled that water was dry, that'd be all the proof you'd need that water wasn't wet.

FICA taxes are NOT special. they do not fund medicare. ALL taxes go into the same pot, then the government funds what it wants.\n\nAgain, none of this has to do with the efficiency of Medicare and their administrative costs.  They are *completely* separate issues when it comes to accounting.\n\n&gt; only when you leave out the services provided by other government agencies.\n\nI don't know how many times I have to repeat this to you, but [services provided by other departments](http://jhppl.dukejournals.org/content/early/2013/02/11/03616878-2079523.abstract) are included in the administrative costs.  Bottom line is the public plans have 2% administrative costs when compared to the 11-17% incurred by both private plans in Medicare and private insurance.\n\n&gt; if you read the report that that statistic comes from, the fbi says 80 billion is the low end estimate, the number they cite is 80-200, iirc.\n\nThe link you provided had two paragraphs with no citations, do you have a link to the actual study?  And do you have any study that looks at both Medicare fraud in comparison to total, instead of relying on cross report comparisons with huge margins of error.\n\n&gt; Because NO tax has anything to do medicare operations. You could abolish FICA tomorrow, and medicare would still make payments. \n\nWhich is, again, irrelevant to the discussion at hand.  FICA currently *does* provide funds for Medicare, and the tax compliance for FICA is very very low.\n\n&gt; but since the government needs to raise money somehow, and that creates real costs, any analysis of medicare's costs need to include the cost of taxation. Since none of the taxes are legally linked to medicare, the only fair way to assess the program is looking at its share of total costs of tax collection.\n\nNo, that's almost the most unfair way to assess the program.  The fair way to asses the program is to compare cost of tax compliance with and without Medicare; this includes FICA taxes, as they are part of Medicare.  This difference is the only thing that can be assigned to administrative costs for Medicare.  The fact is that the tax code would be just as complicated whether or not Medicare exists, and would cost the same to comply with.  The fact you're trying to assign these completely irrelevant costs to Medicare administrative costs is just intellectually dishonest.\n\nBottom line is you just don't have *any* data to back your claim, you're grasping at straws.   \n\nEdit: You *really* need to read this [paper](http://jhppl.dukejournals.org/content/early/2013/02/11/03616878-2079523.abstract) I've linked to repeatedly.

We're talking about how efficient Medicare is and their administrative costs.  You somehow want to include in their administrative overhead 20% of the cost of complying with the entire tax code, almost all of which has nothing to do with Medicare and FICA taxes (certainly not 20%).  With or without Medicare, those tax compliance costs would exist.  You're applying a political argument to an accounting one.  It's about as intellectually dishonest as it gets.\n\n&gt; so when you leave out lots of the cost, costs are really low? amazing!\n\nWhen you leave out the administrative costs and inefficiencies generated by the private plans in Medicare, and just analyze the public plans, yes, costs get low.  It's almost as this is because the private plans are less efficient.  Gasp!\n\n&gt; um, what? 110 billion out of 800 is about 14%.\n\n1.5-2% overhead is $12-16 billion, plus $60 billion in fraud is $72-76 billion is 9.0-9.5%.  This is the overhead of the public plan (I believe Medicare Part A and maybe B).\n\n&gt; it is as likely that the 60 billion is an underestimate as an overestimate. the senate finance committee[1] says between 20 and 100 billion.\n\nIs that the range that one report found, or the range over a bunch of different reports?  It sounds like the latter, in which cause you cannot assume that represents some confidence interval where $60 billion is the median.  The fact is, from what I've seen, there is little rigor in the analysis behind these numbers, mostly based on assumptions.\n\n*Edit: To point, you claim the range of fraud in Medicare is 20 to 100 billion, while the FBI reported there is only 80 billion in total medical fraud a year.  There's barely any accuracy to these numbers, making any cross report comparisons meaningless (i.e. 60 billion vs 80 billion total).*\n\n&gt; no it isn't. the private companies in medicare advantage still have the burden of collections.\n\nWe've been over this, collections from the IRS are included in Medicare's administrative costs, so it'd still be an accurate comparison.\n\n&gt; Medicare advantage has all the disadvantages of traditional medicare PLUS those of private insurers. no wonder it is inefficient.\n\nIt actually operates fairly identically to the public part of Medicare.  If you'd actually read this [paper](http://institute.ourfuture.org/files/Jacob_Hacker_Public_Plan_Choice.pdf) I keep citing:\n\n&gt; However, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has \nfound that administrative costs under the public Medicare plan are less than 2 percent of \nexpenditures, compared with approximately 11 percent of spending by private plans under \nMedicare Advantage.16 This is a near perfect \u201capples to apples\u201d comparison of \nadministrative costs, because the public Medicare plan and Medicare Advantage plans are \noperating under similar rules and treating the same population.\n \n&gt; (And even these numbers may unduly favor private plans: A recent General \nAccounting Office report found that in 2006 Medicare Advantage plans spent 83.3 percent \nof their revenue on medical expenses, with 10.1 percent going to non-medical expenses and \n6.6 percent to profits\u2014a 16.7 percent administrative share.)17\n\nThey're as close as a comparisons as you're going to get, and the public plans have around 2% overhead compared to 11-16.7% that private plans have.  \n\n&gt; i made a small mistake in my math. that is all. You, by contrast, continue to deny legal reality because it suits your ideology to do so.\n\nYou have consistently gotten even the most basic of facts wrong, and even when faced with the data to prove you wrong, you just bury your head in the sand.  And the fact that you think a semantic political definition somehow alters reality is mind boggling.\n\nI challenge you this: on actual logical merits, argue for me why tax code compliance costs that are *completely* unrelated to how Medicare operates, should somehow be included in their administrative costs?

The specific cost of fica vs. income taxes is irrelevant, because legally, what source the income is from is irrelevant.\n\nWe're talking accounting, and you're trying to use a *legal* argument to back your case?  Just laughable.  Somehow the fact that the US tax code is riddled with exemptions and loopholes requiring higher compliance costs is somehow supposed to be counted towards Medicare overhead?  Please.  If you were being intellectually honest at all you'd see how pathetic this argument is.  Until you can show how much cost tax compliance with FICA is, you don't have an argument.\n\n&gt; medicare/caid's administrative costs are usually cited at 6%. \n\nThose figures that cite 6% either include the private plans in Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D, or were unaware that cost collection from the IRS and other services are included in the original figures, and thus double count when \"recalculating\".  When looking at just the public plans, as reported in the trustees report, you get [closer to around 1.5-2.0%](http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Mcare-admin.jpg).\n\n&gt; then we should count that as part of administrative expenses, not care. so instead of spending 750 billion on healthcare and 50 on admin, they spend 110 billion on admin and spend 690 on healthcare. that's an admin ratio of 16% right there.\n\nAfter all this discussion and you don't even know how administrative costs are calculated? They're done as a percent of total expenditure, as can be seen in almost any graph, article or paper that discusses this issue.  It was even directly laid out in the heritage article you posted, do you not read your own sources?\n\nFixing these two glaringly inaccurate parts, you get to around 9.0-9.5% overhead, still less than the 12-17% reported for private insurance.  And this is making the most generous assumptions one can, i.e. that the $60 billion figure is accurate and not an overestimate and that private insurance has $0 fraud.\n\n&gt; then you have to add the cost of tax compliance on top of that. \n\nWhich you've yet to show is a large burden at all, or how it compares with the burden compliance with private insurance costs.  Until you can produce reliable figures citing this, this argument is bunk.\n\n&gt; Of course, then there is the further issue of patient pools. medicare beneficiaries consume much more healthcare than everyone else, because they are old. if you look at admin costs per patient, instead of per healthcare dollar, medicare is worse than private companies.\n\nIf this were true than you'd expect to see the private plans in Medicare have about the same administrative costs, but they don't.  As shown above and repeated often, [Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D have around 11% overhead verses the 2% that the public Medicare plan has](http://institute.ourfuture.org/files/Jacob_Hacker_Public_Plan_Choice.pdf).  This is as apples-to-apples comparison you can get and there is a large difference.\n\nBased on the amount of basic mistakes you're (repeatedly) making, please read up on the area instead of relying on Heritage Foundation for your facts.  [This](http://institute.ourfuture.org/files/Jacob_Hacker_Public_Plan_Choice.pdf) is a decent start for some of the basic facts, and if you really want to get wonky on administrative costs you can check out [this paper](http://jhppl.dukejournals.org/content/early/2013/02/11/03616878-2079523.abstract) (might be gated).

One will always have a wider array of use when it comes to lethality than the other.\nLet's take situations completely off the board and devise a thought experiment: Give 100 morons assault rifles, and 100 morons pistols. Tell them all to rack up as many bodies as possible. Which group will have the higher body count? My guess is the morons with assault rifles.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8jagpm", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361480047", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "cassander", "id": "t1_c8ja7rv", "parent_id": "t1_c8ja1el", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431365060, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1361479831, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18xiy7", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8ja7rv", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361479373", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "majibob", "id": "t1_c8ja1el", "parent_id": "t1_c8j9rcl", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431364976, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Once again: the comparison was to illustrate that some weapons are more effective at killing than others.
