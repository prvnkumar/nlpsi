The reason for this, within the philosophy, is that means of production is a capital that confers additional rights and can create some outcomes which can be viewed as net negative through the exercise of private property rights (which exist in both philosophies). Within libertarian socialism, the view is that means of production are a capital that by definition cannot belong to a single party while still maintaining a consistent application of individual rights. \n\nWhat this means in practice is not that the government has the right of ownership to means of production, but that each person affected by the circumstance of such capital has equal right to that capital.", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "JordanLeDoux", "id": "t1_celpnkx", "parent_id": "t3_1ut93n", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431875125, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "activist", "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1ut93n", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_celpnkx", "author_flair_text": "[Political Activism Leader][Progressive Libertarian]", "created_utc": "1389312791", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}

In addition, you believe firmly that what you are doing is protected as a fundamental right by your government, but the agents of that government are engaging in violent efforts to stop you.\n\nNow you may feel differently about whether or not the efforts were in fact protected by the First Amendment, but I'm saying that *if you did* believe they were, and you were being met with force, you would likely be at least slightly passive-aggressive as well.\n\nI've posted this story several times, but I'll post it here as well.\n\nI was at a protest we were having in a park. We had moved into this park that day and the park closed at 9PM. We had presented the city with a plan our group had agreed upon for how we would prevent property destruction, how we would deal with those who engaged in it (in cooperation with the city and the police), how we would fund any repairs necessary as a result of our activities, how we would work with the city and the police to provide a safe environment, and a whole host of other issues.\n\nThe police moved in at 8PM, announcing that the park was closed early by emergency order of the city. I attempted to move forward near the line of riot police so that I could talk to the people in charge (who I knew on a first name basis at that point) so that I could learn why the emergency order had been issued and who had issued it.\n\nThey ignored me however and after 15 minutes I gave up and turned to leave. The entire time the police had been directing people over a speaker system to leave the park in a peaceful and orderly fashion. As I turned to comply with this order, which I personally felt was both immoral and illegal I might add, I was hit in the back with a baton. It nearly knocked the wind out of me.\n\nI got back up, livid, and nearly tackled the officer that hit me. But then I saw his nametag and realized that he was hoping I hit him. He wanted to beat me. You see, in our very first altercation with the police, the department had conducted itself admirably. They had made their arrests and executed their orders in a fashion which used no more force than necessary and diffused potential problems... all except one officer. Being the PR director, when I was interviewed by local media after that first incident, I praised the police department for their professionalism, but noted the one officer who had been using force enthusiastically by name.\n\nHe was the one that had hit me, and I could see it in his eyes that he wanted to \"even the score\" with me.\n\nI grew up in a fairly conservative house and always had a fairly favorable opinion of the police.

We had moved into this park that day and the park closed at 9PM. We had presented the city with a plan our group had agreed upon for how we would prevent property destruction, how we would deal with those who engaged in it (in cooperation with the city and the police), how we would fund any repairs necessary as a result of our activities, how we would work with the city and the police to provide a safe environment, and a whole host of other issues.\n\nThe police moved in at 8PM, announcing that the park was closed early by emergency order of the city. I attempted to move forward near the line of riot police so that I could talk to the people in charge (who I knew on a first name basis at that point) so that I could learn why the emergency order had been issued and who had issued it.\n\nThey ignored me however and after 15 minutes I gave up and turned to leave. The entire time the police had been directing people over a speaker system to leave the park in a peaceful and orderly fashion. As I turned to comply with this order, which I personally felt was both immoral and illegal I might add, I was hit in the back with a baton. It nearly knocked the wind out of me.\n\nI got back up, livid, and nearly tackled the officer that hit me. But then I saw his nametag and realized that he was hoping I hit him. He wanted to beat me. You see, in our very first altercation with the police, the department had conducted itself admirably. They had made their arrests and executed their orders in a fashion which used no more force than necessary and diffused potential problems... all except one officer. Being the PR director, when I was interviewed by local media after that first incident, I praised the police department for their professionalism, but noted the one officer who had been using force enthusiastically by name.\n\nHe was the one that had hit me, and I could see it in his eyes that he wanted to \"even the score\" with me.\n\nI grew up in a fairly conservative house and always had a fairly favorable opinion of the police.

The Police in the United States are very well trained, in many senses of the word. Fundamentally, people that largely agreed with us within the police had a \"mode\" their minds went into when in action that was not conducive to considering the merits of a Constitutional argument, or an ethical/moral argument, or even if the protest would benefit them. Secondarily, as has become known now and we knew at the time, the Federal government was greatly involved in pushing Police action and oversight of the process, and not many officers are going to think for themselves when the Feds are poking around.\n\n2. Yes, it would have greatly benefited from this. However, the people involved were enormously disenfranchised. This meant that the group was very, very conscious about both being co-opted by hidden forces (of which several attempts were actually made), and of further disenfranchising the people that actually showed up. These were the most frustrated people, and so many, more than affecting real change, just wanted to be *heard*. There were those such as myself within Occupy that were greatly interested in affecting real change of some kind, but most simply needed to be psychologically comforted that they mattered. They felt that there was literally no point to their existence politically, and that was scary.\n\nSo... the biggest thing that OWS could have done different is had a national infrastructure. We tried to organize inter-occupy communication, but it was nearly impossible. National organization of some kind that could be plugged into would have been both understandable on a practical level, and would have forced down some much needed structure into the local Occupys.\n\nEarly on OWS (in New York) tried to do this, but they did it in a very \"our way or the highway\" approach that actually further fractured national organization. They basically took the position that they did it first, so it belonged to them nationally. People might have gone along with that, but their inter-occupy organization was ad-hoc, and not prepared in advance, so any claim that it could only be organized through them felt a bit contrived. In addition, they received many times the donations most other Occupys did, but didn't reinvest that back into infrastructure for national organization, which would have been the only way to: 1. generate further financial contributions and 2. consolidate the power of all the individual Occupy groups into something that could have been effectively wielded.", "id": "t1_c7px97v", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "JordanLeDoux", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_15tzmv", "id": "t1_c7pxkog", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "level1", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Federal agencies don't usually police politics, they police power.

I wasn't implying that it was impossible to come to that position if you were informed.\n\nWe actually had several military vets of the Iraq war in Occupy who were very helpful once the police in our city started employing military tactics. \n\nAt one point, at their suggestion, we separated all the information of a key decision into several people until 30 minutes before the event to prevent the police from obtaining the information ahead of time. \n\nAnd yeah, I had to deal with straight up Communists and Anarchists, but all of them were committed to a peaceful protest so long as their positions were heard and considered, which I greatly appreciated.\n\nAs for the passive-aggressive bits you mention... think about it from this point of view: You do not want to aggressively engage the opposition because of a principal you hold and the unwanted consequences of doing so, however the opposition are willing to engage in force (and in some cases quite enjoy doing so).

We had moved into this park that day and the park closed at 9PM. We had presented the city with a plan our group had agreed upon for how we would prevent property destruction, how we would deal with those who engaged in it (in cooperation with the city and the police), how we would fund any repairs necessary as a result of our activities, how we would work with the city and the police to provide a safe environment, and a whole host of other issues.\n\nThe police moved in at 8PM, announcing that the park was closed early by emergency order of the city. I attempted to move forward near the line of riot police so that I could talk to the people in charge (who I knew on a first name basis at that point) so that I could learn why the emergency order had been issued and who had issued it.\n\nThey ignored me however and after 15 minutes I gave up and turned to leave. The entire time the police had been directing people over a speaker system to leave the park in a peaceful and orderly fashion. As I turned to comply with this order, which I personally felt was both immoral and illegal I might add, I was hit in the back with a baton. It nearly knocked the wind out of me.\n\nI got back up, livid, and nearly tackled the officer that hit me. But then I saw his nametag and realized that he was hoping I hit him. He wanted to beat me. You see, in our very first altercation with the police, the department had conducted itself admirably. They had made their arrests and executed their orders in a fashion which used no more force than necessary and diffused potential problems... all except one officer. Being the PR director, when I was interviewed by local media after that first incident, I praised the police department for their professionalism, but noted the one officer who had been using force enthusiastically by name.\n\nHe was the one that had hit me, and I could see it in his eyes that he wanted to \"even the score\" with me.\n\nI grew up in a fairly conservative house and always had a fairly favorable opinion of the police.

This presents tremendous difficulties because the Founding Fathers could not have imagined the problems that would arise in the future. This issue is then compounded upon because of several problems. First, the Constitution itself is vague and short. Granted this was done on purpose, but it has made for a mess of interpretations all over the place. Second, the Constitution is relatively difficult to amend. There has been twenty-seven successful amendments and I'd call two of them a wash. I understand why the amendment process should be slow, Prohibition is an excellent case in this, but it also presents real challenges when situations arise that need to be addressed on a constitutional, rather than statutory, level. \n\nThird, and I think this is what I think he emphasizes, there is the Constitution has these mythic properties for individuals. Individuals put the Constitution as equal to the Bible and treat it, as well as other symbols of our country, as an inflexible guide for how our country should be run. I, personally, think the myths surrounding the Constitution needs to be addressed on a nation-wide dialogue and broken down. Is it an eloquent document? Yes. Does it fit our current circumstances? Debatable, but consider the recent trend away from using the US Constitution as a model for drafting new constitutions. Others may recognize what we ourselves are too stubborn to do and perhaps we should listen.   \n\nAs for the changes that I would propose? There is a list that fluctuates based upon current events and recent readings. Currently, my top three are: \n\n**Proportional Representation** Particularly, I believe that our electoral system could take a note from Germany's mixed member districts. I think this would help alleviate some of ideological divisions that plagues our current political parties and may (finally) help smaller parties develop into politically viable parties. \n\n**More Explicit Equal Rights and Right to Privacy** Despite its utility, the 14th Amendment is a poor source to rely on for granting equal rights. I want judges to be unable to say the Constitution does not protect the rights of its citizens and individuals living under its guide because of some quality they possess. I believe that the right to privacy has been accepted by much of the legal profession, although there are some hold outs, but that this needs to be written into a document. \n\n**Abolish the Death Penalty** There are still 33 states in addition to the United State federal government and the military which sanction the death penalty. However, globally, we are in poor company considering the other countries that utilize capital punishment. Within the United States, though, maintaining the death penalty raises concerns about race, class, and mental health in terms of access to resources and sentencing; the overall costs of the death penalty; and if it can be said to be a deterrent to crime.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_15qt2q", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7pc3eh", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357073035", "ups": 4, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_15qt2q", "id": "t1_c7pz4l4", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "level1", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_15qt2q", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1430837475, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'd like to see regular constitutional conventions.

The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.\n\nThe debt SHALL NOT BE QUESTIONED. There is a strong constitutional argument that there is no such thing as a \"debt ceiling\". The way the media reports it, people think it's giving authority to borrow more money, when in reality it's money the government has already spent. That is why the credit agencies downgraded the US.

Both are financial punishments of different scales and forms.\n\n**Use An Established Corporate Statute**: This would be something like RICO, or other regulatory laws.

We helped everyone else get their footing back, on the condition that the rest of the world used the US Dollar as its reserve currency. (This is called the [Bretton-Woods System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system).)\n\nWhat this means for the rest of the world is that when their currency fails, or their central bank fails, their currency can be \"backed\" by the US dollar, making the United States economy essentially the insurance policy for world economic stability. If the US economy failed, or our currency failed, or our debt defaulted, all currencies which use USD as the lender of last resort would instantly lose their insurance policy, and investors the world over would suddenly need to price in much higher risk multiples. (Theoretically, the risk of the US defaulting should already be priced into everything else that uses USD for reserve currency.)\n\nPractically what this means is that the rest of the world has bought our debt because it is safe, and it is safe because the world has bought our debt. This is the primary economic reason that wealth concentrates in the US. We purchase things from other countries, giving us a product, we do so by borrowing, and we borrow from the countries which we are buying the product from. \n\nIt's an insanely complex form of handing someone an IOU for a new car, then paying them back with another car that you purchased from a different dealer with another IOU.\n\nAnyway, this is a simplified explanation of why US Treasuries are considered so safe.\n\nBut Treasuries are issued to raise money for spending the Federal Government wants to make. That is, Treasuries represent the money that the government is spending this year on something but doesn't have money for.\n\nWhile only about 50% of our debt is held by foreign nationals, the process is actually very similar with multinational corporations, which hold much of the rest.\n\nPrinting out a trillion dollar coin to pay debt off would create a negative feedback-loop of the trust in our system, and a fiat currency, being a claim on the promise of future human labor in the society which mints it is backed entirely by trust. This is the actual cause (in my mind) of inflation, and why it can be held off for so long, despite scary metrics, then cascade into terror quicker than anyone can keep up.\n\nFiat currencies are inherently more volatile, but are also more flexible.", "id": "t1_c7ftuch", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "JordanLeDoux", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_14qe0p", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430660646, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "activist", "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7ftuch", "author_flair_text": "[Political Activism Leader][Progressive Libertarian]", "created_utc": "1355379641", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

The reason for that is quite simply that you cannot force others to think like you. I will return to this point later.\n\n**Reasons for Apathy**\n\nParticularly in the United States, apathy (usually) often comes in one of two flavors:\n\n1. This has no impact on my life, or;\n2. I have no impact on this.\n\nOn rare occasions, a person's apathy may be triggered for both these reasons. Most reasons that people give for apathy are dressed up versions of these two issues. It would seem that greater education should effectively deal with the first and greater transparency should help deal with the second, but this does not end up being the case most of the time.\n\nThe reality is that number 1 is more often triggered by an *emotion* of isolation from our society and number 2 is more often triggered by an *emotion* of helplessness. Ironically, both of these problems are best served by getting out and participating in the processes, whether by voting, protesting, organizing, or other venues. But the apathetic are least likely to participate in these things.\n\nIn this sense, apathy can be likened to societal depression. If you were to examine the public as a single thing, apathy would be very similar to depressive moods or episodes. And like depression, one of the best ways to help alleviate it is to choose to stop perpetuating it... to \"get out there\". And like depression, there is apathy that runs deeper than the simple case of being disengaged, and will require more intense therapy.\n\n**How to Treat Apathy**\n\nI have volunteered as the PR director for Occupy Portland, I worked on the Ron Paul Blimp project in 2008 and I worked with Trevor Lyman in late 2007 to organize a money bomb on December 16th that gave a name of opportunity to a small group of people that wouldn't shut up: the Tea Partiers (and I say that with affection).\n\nHaving participated in so much civic engagement, political activism and protest, I have had to address apathy in other people to an enormous degree. I do not have a magic wand of fairy dust that makes the apathy go away, but I have identified basic patterns that help to reframe how a person is thinking about their civic involvement.\n\n&gt;*Empowerment*\n\nThe first step to 'curing' apathy is to empower the individual. You want to start small with this... come walk with a couple thousand other people a few hundred feet because you think this is important... send an email getting it off your chest to your *local* governments... here, I made this sign, and I already have this corner, so if you want you can hold it for five minutes and wave at passing cars.\n\nI'm sure you're saying, \"But wait! How do you get them off the sofa to even have the choice to do such things?\" You don't. Or rather, you can't. The reality is that they need motivation to do so, and since all forms of mass communication are contrived, purposefully or not, to destroy the motivation of the public, it is most likely this motivation needs to come from within. It doesn't have to be much, just wanting to go down and stare at the strange people holding signs even, but it has to be there.\n\nIf you get particularly lucky, you can stand in front of a camera for ten seconds in your life and deliver 15 words that cut through the crushing hopelessness of a handful of people sometime, but if you're talking about a mass scale, it's really about retail politics. Knock on doors, hand out fliers, buy someone coffee, let them know that you *care* about what they think because they *matter*.\n\n&gt;*Goals*\n\nA good leader does not choose the goals for everyone else during a political event... they frame the question so that people can choose goals that they care about, then convinces them that doing this thing will help them have the choice to care about that thing.\n\nPeople often go into political events with an all or nothing, instant gratification mindset. That *must* be broken before it sends them spiraling again. Instead, people should first be worried about more personal goals: \"I want to stand up for what I believe to be right, even if the police come... I want to feel brave, like I took a risk for what I believe in.\"\n\nIf you can ever get a person to the point where they feel they have taken a risk to believe in something, it will be very hard for them to be apathetic about it in the future. The key is the make the action of taking the perceived risk *easy*. Going to be staying out all night, waiting for the cops to come like we did often at Occupy? Offer them coffee, hot chocolate, cigarettes if they smoke, stories, support, and perhaps most importantly an ear to listen to them. Let them express themselves. Let them be an individual. Encourage that.\n\nIndividuals are almost never apathetic. It is only by viewing yourself as a small piece of some machine some other will operates that you become apathetic. Encourage individuality, and then create an environment where it is safe be wrong and it is safe to be different, as long as we all want to be better.\n\nIf you can achieve these things, you have likely cured that person of apathy for a very long time.\n\n&gt;*Actions*\n\nAfter the steps above, the follow through to action should be simple if you provide a support network of whatever kind is needed for the action the goals require them to take. Is the action voting? Create a carpool system, or give them dozens of yard signs to put up and hand out to others. Is the action a political protest? Provide them with advice and experience about what to expect and how to be heard, what to watch out for and what are the mythical boogey-men of protesting. Is the action a political rally or fundraiser? Give them a way to follow up a donation with a way to multiply their effort, such as discussion areas, canvasing, and so on.\n\nThe bottom line with this section is that you want to be providing a network of other people which the person feels they can easily fall into for support when they encounter the unknown. In that setting, the unknown can seem exciting or exhilarating, not frightening or scary. \n\n**Why Hasn't This Been Done?**\n\nI made it sound rather elaborate, but all the same not difficult to do. So why isn't it done?\n\nThere are a couple of reasons. One is that the political system in most democratic-ish societies is rather structured to encourage this apathy, and this is especially true in the United States. First Past the Post voting systems, Gerrymandering, outright voter fraud and other such contrivances are *designed* to cause this wearing down of the voters' individualism and will. Politicians want elections that aren't hard. It isn't (probably) some grand evil scheme, it's just them being human...\n\nIn addition to that, the only parts of the State which *actually* tell us what to do (because politicians don't personally do this) are corrupt to the point of psychic shock in some communities now. Yes, many people would still call the police in a grave emergency, but our society's faith in public defenders is severely thin, and it creates a sort of mental wear on people. This is not at all helped that the police are motivated all on their own, without the prompting of any ideology or politician, to preserve the status quo. That means that extremely uncontrollable situations, such a crowds, are to be controlled and removed as much as possible, in their minds as a safety issue regardless of the rights issue.\n\nThis is now firmly entrenched as a form of extremely soft fascism in our society now. Most people alive today don't have a great living example of what real fascism is, and to them this is pretty harmful to their psyche. Admittedly, it's not a good situation, but it creates a sense of despair.\n\nAnd that's really the crux of the issue. ***Despair***. \n\nThe reason this hasn't been done is because most of the people are despairing at the situation of the society they belong to, wondering when the hero culture has taught them to wait for will come. And every year seems to be another orbit of the drain, spiraling further in towards some indescribable \"end of society/America/whatever\", and it frankly makes them sad.\n\nOur news is depressing, our movies are largely depressing, our books are often depressing, our poetry is fairly depressing, our world seems rather depressing with the current events. Do you think it is merely chance that our society is completely obsessed right now with zombies, mindless drones, destroying our civilization seemingly for the hubris of not watching where we are running? Or asteroid impact scenarios? Or alien invasions? Or global pandemics?\n\nFor all our despair, many people recognize that such monumental events would *force* the status quo to change, and so we get an odd fetishistic feeling when it comes to \"reseting\" humanity. There's that glimmer that through all the death and destruction, maybe the world might possibly be better for it. A self-annihilation fantasy.\n\nSo how do you cure apathy? Why, you cause everyone to see things the way that you do. Perfect harmony. The seemingly unsolvable problem of so many opinions being formed into single group actions would be solved, and no one would have a need to feel unappreciated. Unfortunately you can't. So instead, your best bet is to try, with all your might, to make society a better place for the individual; for a person to be themselves, unapologetically. Even when that means doing things you disapprove of as long as it doesn't harm others. Because when people feel like an individual, their apathy, the feeling that they are of no consequence, evaporates.", "id": "t1_c7emvxk", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "JordanLeDoux", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c7epqll", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "ObjectiveTits", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_14n14m", "selftext": "It's a hoax.
