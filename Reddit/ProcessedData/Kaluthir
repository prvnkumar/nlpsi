About 85% of Americans had health care as of when Obamacare was passed, IIRC. Of the 15% remaining, many were either eligible for government health care programs (Medicare/Medicaid), and the others were presumably above the poverty line but spent their money on things other than health care. That could be the health care problem. Obamacare is an attempt to solve this by mandating that everyone get health insurance. There are several problems with that particular implementation, though: first, banning pre-existing conditions means that you can wait until you get sick to purchase the coverage you need. Second, it requires people who may not be able to afford health insurance to pay an additional tax. If they can't afford to buy health insurance, why the hell are you taking *more* money from them? Third, the penalties on employers are counterproductive. It's often cheaper for companies to pay the penalty or cut hours instead of buying health insurance. There's a lot more nuance, but those are the main drawbacks of the ACA.\n\nOr we could look at the cost of health care, which can be exorbitant. That's a pretty big problem, but then you have to remember that the $50,000 ambulance bills are there for negotiation. If an uninsured person took a ride in an ambulance, the hospital doesn't expect to get $50k from them in a lump sum. You can often negotiate it down to 20% or less, to be paid back over several years. For elective procedures, you can even get a medical loan. \n\nOne thing is clear, though: if you get care in America, it'll be world-class.

The dispute is over whether reducing one country's gun ownership rate will also reduce that country's crime rate. The UK, Canada, and Australia have always had low crime rates compared to the US, even before they instituted strict gun control. In the US, UK, and Australia, new gun control laws have had a negligible effect on the crime rate. \n\nIn the US, the crime rate started going down in 1993. In 1994, the Federal Assault Weapon Ban was passed, and the crime rate continued to go down at the same rate. In 2004, the AWB expired and the crime rate kept going down at the same rate.

First of all, the laws are toothless because no gun control advocate really has any clue what the fuck they're talking about. [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ospNRk2uM3U) is the sponsor of one gun control bill who doesn't even know what a barrel shroud is, much less why it should be banned (despite the fact that her bill would ban them). [Here](http://dailycaller.com/2013/04/04/obama-newtown-children-killed-with-fully-automatic-weapon/) is President Obama, who said that the Sandy Hook shooter used a semi-automatic weapon, and then 'corrected' himself to say that it was fully-automatic. As even a mild gun enthusiast would know, it's essentially impossible for a US citizen to legally buy a fully-automatic AR-15. Lanza's AR-15 was certainly not fully automatic. Seriously, take a look at the legislation that's been proposed. We've gotten Assault Weapon Bans (which ban certain guns based on cosmetic features, and leave functionally identical firearms legal). We've gotten magazine capacity limitations (the vast majority of murders are committed with 7 or fewer shots; even the deadliest school shootings in US history, VT and Columbine, averaged 10 or fewer rounds fired per magazine). We've gotten tons of press attention on the Manchin-Toomey background check bill (which has the potential to criminalize law-abiding Americans for things that don't lead to crimes) while ignoring Sen. Coburn's proposal that most gun owners (myself included) would support.\n\nSecond, I think you're attempting to imply that the NRA is not representative of the general public, that the NRA is somehow stonewalling gun control efforts that the public supports. The NRA has a much larger membership base than most lobbying groups, and their funding predominantly comes from membership dues rather than gun industry contributions.

I'm basing that claim on the [incident](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hainan_Island_incident) in April 2001, in which a Chinese pilot accidentally rammed an American aircraft. It's also hard to tell whether, say, an M1A2 Abrams can beat a T-90A. As Xing_the_Rubicon said, it also depends on the battle. The US can project force better than any other country, which is why we're considered a superpower.

Of the 6,843 homicides we know the circumstances of (i.e. excluding the categories \"Unknown\" and \"Other-not specified\"), 2349 were during the commission of a felony, suspected felony, under the influence of narcotics, or were gangland killings.

They are worth worth a great deal less in terms of what an individual can practically carry concealed on their person or in a vehicle.\n\nI carry concealed whenever it's legal, and nobody ever notices. The average full-sized pistol might not hold up to a Terry frisk, but a Keltec PF9 or a small revolver is easily concealable. In any case, in a large-scale smuggling operation you'd probably have guns disguised as machine parts and similar things.\n\n&gt;What? The reason so many American guns are being smuggled to Mexico is that guns are so much easier to get in America than in Mexico. A certain fraction of a given countries problems, be it crime or drugs or guns or anything else, can spill over a border. Right now some of our gun control problem is spilling over onto their side of the border. But it's not true that just because their efforts at gun control are degraded by our policies, they shouldn't bother - and it certainly is nonsensical to say that we shouldn't bother because of this circumstance.\n\nThe point is that they *are* being smuggled. They actually aren't being smuggled from the US in large numbers; most cartels' weapons came from the Mexican government or were smuggled from overseas. The point is: Mexico has incredibly strict gun control laws and yet they're readily available.\n\n&gt;Mhm. Not nearly comprable to the ease with which perfectly good, whole, sellable drugs can be produced at home.\n\nSure, it's probably easier to throw some Miracle-gro on your pot plant than it is to obtain the machinery to manufacture banned weapons (or magazines). This isn't a contest, though. You said that drugs were easy to grow, and I said that 30-round AR-15 magazines are easy to make; those statements aren't mutually exclusive.\n\n&gt;Yep, that's true. It's also not contrary evidence to my argument.\n\nThe point is that *no matter how strict you make gun laws, people will still kill each other* (and often with weapons that are restricted). In Japan, it is almost completely illegal to own a firearm (the exceptions are very limited), but there are still a dozen or so firearm homicides each year. Since it is impossible to legally buy a semi-automatic pistol there, the Yakuza smuggle them in from China and the Philippines.

If there are 100 people who want guns, you need to smuggle 100 guns. Period.

She consistently lies about statistics to push her shitty legislation. Here is her statistic:\n\n&gt;&gt;In a June 9, 2011 response to an inquiry from Senator Feinstein, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) Acting Director Kenneth Melson stated that of the 29,284 firearms recovered in Mexico in 2009 and 2010 and submitted to the ATF National Tracing Center, 20,504 were United States sourced.\n\n[Here's](http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20110209-mexicos-gun-supply-and-90-percent-myth) an article debunking that. Basically, it's selection bias: Mexico only submits the firearms they think the ATF will be able to trace. They do not submit the firearms that came from their own government, were traced to Mexican citizens, or that could not have come from the US.\n\nShe then goes on to quote other Democratic politicans, and advocate her own AWB and Project Gunrunner (which was a miserable failure because of the gross incompetence and negligence of federal officials). \n\n&gt;Yes. It is completely ridiculous to imply that this is a reason not to do anything. Why is less killing not good enough?\n\nYou seem to think that an Assault Weapon Ban would result in less killing.

You do *not* have a right to *feel* safer, though you might (if you live in CA) have the right to *pursue* and *obtain* safety (for instance, by shooting a burglar who is an *imminent* threat to your safety).", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Kaluthir", "id": "t1_c93zfgi", "parent_id": "t1_c93ywct", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431730383, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93zfgi", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364475795", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Dennis_Langley", "id": "t1_c93ywct", "parent_id": "t1_c93svvk", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431730145, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93ywct", "author_flair_text": "[PhD Candidate:Voting and Ideology][Liberal]", "created_utc": "1364472897", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Kaluthir", "id": "t1_c93svvk", "parent_id": "t1_c93rzyh", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431727174, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93svvk", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364439666", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Dennis_Langley", "id": "t1_c93rzyh", "parent_id": "t1_c93r2re", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1435561177, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93rzyh", "author_flair_text": "[PhD Candidate:Voting and Ideology][Liberal]", "created_utc": "1364437117", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Kaluthir", "id": "t1_c93r2re", "parent_id": "t1_c93kflw", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431726332, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1b46fm", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93r2re", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364434365", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Dennis_Langley", "id": "t1_c93kflw", "parent_id": "t1_c93jrb0", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1431723087, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93kflw", "author_flair_text": "[PhD Candidate:Voting and Ideology][Liberal]", "created_utc": "1364415716", "distinguished": null, "ups": 3}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Kaluthir", "id": "t1_c93jrb0", "parent_id": "t1_c93jh9j", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431722742, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1b46fm", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93jrb0", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364413965", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Dennis_Langley", "id": "t1_c93jh9j", "parent_id": "t1_c93gkf3", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431722601, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1b46fm", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93jh9j", "author_flair_text": "[PhD Candidate:Voting and Ideology][Liberal]", "created_utc": "1364413258", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Kaluthir", "id": "t1_c93gkf3", "parent_id": "t1_c93fng8", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431721047, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c93gkf3", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364405628", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}

Even if their wealth is not a product of the amount of work they did or skill they have, there's no need to take it away.\n\nAnd here's another problem: you're only considering good luck, but what about bad luck?

Of course we're drawing arbitrary lines here, but that's the nature of taxation: we'll always be arguing where the lines lie. \n\nJustification for this: if the income is due largely to luck then the individual didn't \"earn it\", he was simply lucky. Now I don't believe that the gods (or God, et al) control luck, so I can see no obvious moral wrong should the lucky portion of earnings be taken away from the individual. And since a social contract requires money to maintain then this \"lucky money\" is a good source. How the social contract specifies _spending_ the money gained in this way is a separate issue to discussed at another time.\n\nOTOH it is true that, in any particular instance, skill may have been responsible rather than luck, so under the scheme above some wealthy individuals would not get to keep all their well-earned reward. But the numbers indicate that, in the aggregate, that would not be a likely situation. In any case it is important to tax away only the estimated \"lucky\" part of income since, once you cut into the \"skilled\" part of income you reduce incentive. \n\nNote that cutting the \"lucky\" part of income won't reduce incentive *in the long run* because the individual would not likely have been able to earn \"lucky\" earnings each year anyway.

The 2A was obviously not written with this theory in mind; in fact, it was intended so that the state *wouldn't* have a monopoly on violence. \n\nRegardless of this issue, there's still a problem with giving LEOs access to weapons that are illegal for ordinary civilians. Why would you make it illegal for civilians to own magazines that hold more than 10 rounds? I'm assuming you'd do so to minimize the body count in case someone decides to kill people. Why would police be exempted from this law? I'm sure a lot of police departments around the country have Dorners-in-waiting, or people going through nasty divorces, or people with undiagnosed mental issues, or even people who might get carried away or use bad judgment. And that's not even mentioning the fact that police are often completely unsafe when they use their firearms: in NY, there were about half a dozen police officers who expended something like 80 rounds to kill a single unarmed man (and they ended up killing quite a few innocent bystanders). Why wouldn't you want to limit their ability to make mistakes that fatal? In any case, a civilian is much less likely to have 'backup' than a police officer. If a concealed carrier has to reload, he or she had better find some cover and reload quickly! If a police officer needs to reload, he can just yell \"Cover me! I'm reloading!\" and take his time while his buddy suppresses the bad guy.

When you make laws, you generally want people with a legal background. Lawyers will end up being the ones who prosecute and defend people based on the laws, so it makes sense that they write the laws so that there is as little confusion as possible.\n\n2. There are a lot of different approaches to many problems. Take obesity as an example: which expert would you consult? A doctor might offer a medical solution, a chef would focus on food, a personal trainer might emphasize exercise and supplements, and then you'd have teachers saying that anti-obesity campaigns should start in schools. They may all be right, but you only have a finite amount of resources with which to carry out your plan. That's a big problem, and that's when  the only dispute is of the relative importance of the different approaches.\n\n3. \"Experts\" in a certain field are not a monolithic group. Even when there is generally agreement within the field, there are often many competing political philosophies at play. Look at climate change: most scientists agree with the general theory of climate change, but there's often disagreement on the best solution. Do you use cap-and-trade laws? Do you use carbon taxes? What do you do about countries like China, that don't really give a shit about pollution? What happens when companies figure out loopholes (like when Chrysler designated the PT Cruiser as a truck to boost their truck MPG average)? What is a fair restriction?\n\n4. What do you do when people disagree with the experts you've chosen? On one hand, you don't want to bring in a homeopath when you're discussing a single-payer health care system because you'll end up spending tax dollars on ineffective care.

Yale and Stanford are both doing this, if I recall correctly. While this isn't going to have any immediate impact, we will eventually see more and more people electing to take free courses without a paper degree at the end. Today's working generation (23-30ish) are starting to see less value in a paper degree. We all kind of know that the whole system is BS.\n\nWhen we are in positions to make hiring decisions, we are less likely to hold a degree with the level of importance our parents did. We know that the skills and knowledge behind the degree are more important than the paper itself. This shift will cause more and more people to pursue free education options, and colleges will need to lower their price in order to win back more business. We're still looking at tens of thousands of dollars, but it may be $10,000 for a degree, instead of $40,000.\n\nGranted, this is all very optimistic.

Personal self-defense (i.e. concealed carry). This is mostly an extension of the right to life.

Personal self-defense (i.e. concealed carry). This is mostly an extension of the right to life.

I can use guns safely, so why should the government take them away from me because other people do not use them safely? I hate the 'nanny state' we're becoming; I should be able to do anything I want as long as it doesn't affect anyone else, and my gun ownership does not affect anyone else. In any case, this is especially important in light of my first reason. Guns represent the power to overthrow a government. A government that does not trust its citizens with that power is dangerous.\n\nNotice that there is nothing about hunting or target shooting in here.

Defense against a tyrannical government. This is an extension of the right to liberty. I doubt this will happen in my lifetime, but this is the primary reason for the 2A. If my right to bear arms is taken away, or even just infringed on (e.g. \"you can only own something with a sporting purpose, like a shotgun or bolt-action rifle\"), it decreases the chance of a successful uprising against a tyrannical government later (even if 'later' means several centuries from now).\n\n2. Personal self-defense (i.e. concealed carry). This is mostly an extension of the right to life. It's actually [safer](http://www.ncpa.org/images/1029.gif) to defend yourself with a gun than to comply with a mugger's demands. \n\n3. Defense of my family (i.e. home defense). This is an extension of the right to life and property. If someone breaks into my house at 3AM, I don't want to be at their mercy. This and the previous point are actually not that rare; there are between 800,000 and 2.5 million defensive gun uses per year in the US.\n\n4. Ideological disagreement with gun control. I can use guns safely, so why should the government take them away from me because other people do not use them safely? I hate the 'nanny state' we're becoming; I should be able to do anything I want as long as it doesn't affect anyone else, and my gun ownership does not affect anyone else. In any case, this is especially important in light of my first reason. Guns represent the power to overthrow a government. A government that does not trust its citizens with that power is dangerous.\n\nNotice that there is nothing about hunting or target shooting in here. I enjoy both of those things, but realistically, I could find hobbies to replace them (perhaps even archery).

Of course not!

Would everyone just stop washing their hands *en masse*? No, you'd still get a majority who wash their hands every single time, because most people don't want to get other people sick. Would there be a small minority of restaurants in which cooks don't wash their hands? Sure, just like there are restaurants in which cooks don't wash their hands despite the laws requiring it. If you got sick from eating there you could still complain to the management, organizations like the Better Business Bureau, and on online forums like Yelp. You could even use legal action against the restaurant if it was bad enough.  Now, washing your hands isn't an example of something anyone seriously cares about deregulating because the cost of soap and a little bit of water isn't very significant, and because you can objectively say that not washing your hands makes people unsafe. Can you honestly say that every health and safety regulation regarding food handling both (a) imposes the minimum cost possible on a small business, and (b) can be objectively proven to significantly reduce risks to public health and safety?\n\n&gt;It's no surprise that your friend cannot name any specific rules and regulations.
