{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I'm more cynical about the process.  Cities know the sports franchise can profitably build their own stadiums.  Rather, the owners know that cities are going to compete with eachother for the teams.  By keeping the number of teams lower than an 'open market', they are able to exert monopoly power over those additional rents (economic 'rents', not rental fees per se) that cities *might* get from having a team.  However, it's quite dubious that sports franchises create additional rents or rather just pull rents from other locations or activities (or other local teams). Yes, lots of money is spent going to a game, having drinks and dinner, parking, or even shopping nearby.  It's not clear how much of that is a *net gain* versus just shifting those expenditures from other activities.  \n\nWhat's worse is that not only to cities arguably spend too much getting teams, it happens too frequently as teams can replay the subsidy game every 8 years by claiming the old stadium is in need of replacing.  \n\nThere are some terrible consequences to having a legal sports monopoly.  It's not that only the Patriots can sell football jerseys with their logo, but that the NFL restricts entry of new teams into the league.  There are many margins of monopolization.\n\nHaving said that, a stadium could be an easy and viable way for a city to direct me monies into a specific area of the city.  It's hard to encourage development in impoverished zones of the city.  A stadium is politically popular, easily visible, and has a bunch of people ready to start building and attracting fans with the signing of a deal.  That's the political economy of it.  Unfortunately, if the city makes a bad contract when doing this, the team may have no incentive to stay (like the Nets in Newark).  Ultimately, there are better ways.  When a city builds. Stadium for a team,  it's not necessarily creating economic growth, but rather directing it away from another location.  It also doesn't trickle down nearly as much as other investments.

That private capture of what are public utilities elsewhere in the world creates a very different dynamic, but I think it would be fair to say that it is a \"Complex\" in the same manner one would refer to the military-industrial sector. \n\nThe key difference is the flow of funds. In Eisenhower's initial cautioning, he expressed concern that the redirection of public funds to private industry would create an incentive to be in a perpetual state of war. In the modern example of privatized infrastructure, we see much of the same concern - except that the government has been eliminated as a middle man and money is collected directly from citizens/consumers of services. \n\nI think the main issue though is that when you compare these two things - security/military spending and infrastructure - the results of investment are much more dramatic in the military scenario. An incentive to pour money into military investment can result in violence - something we perceive as a palpable threat. But misspending on infrastructure has its costs as well - too much private capture can prolong the process of construction of necessary developments in a way that supports private industry and not public interest.\n\nA concrete example is broadband expansion. A huge swath of America does not have access to high-speed internet, something that puts a major economic damper on these areas' economies. However, user uptake in these areas is likely to be slow, and in a lot of America is there either a lack of the right number of people or disposable income (or both) to make the investment worthwhile for private industry. That was the impetus for the National Broadband Plan - to provide federal dollars to incentivize greater infrastructure build out. We did the same thing with phones and television. \n\nThe \"cautionary\" concern with infrastructure \"complex\" for the US has much more to do with effective expenditures of public funds and oversight on consumer protection.

When banks stop lending, that reduces the money supply.  This is because when the bank borrows a dollar (e.g. A deposit), it lends out $10 through checking accounts.  $1 becomes $10.  So when banks stop lending, that's less money.\n\nIMHO, we should have been printing more.  We have almost no inflation, at least below the Feds stated target, and when velocity is falling, the govt can print money (and use it to buy real resources) without inducing high inflation.

So here's what happened when I went to motor vehicle to change my address on my license of 30 years. \n\nI had to provide a certified copy of my birth certificate. Okay, everyone had to do that. But because I am female and the name on my birth certificate does not match the name I am now using, I had to provide a certified copy of my marriage certificate, showing how my name got changed. In my case, the name I have been using since I was 19 or 20 is the name of my first husband who I married in the late 1960s in an American territory and from whom I have been divorced since the early 1970s. That was so long ago that I can't even remember the exact year, let alone the month and day. So when I called the territory to obtain a copy of the marriage certificate I was told that records were not computerized that far back so without the exact date I would have to visit the office and \"look through the books\" to find the date myself! This was not just because of a backward US territory. My current husband's ex called him in a panic asking if he remembered the date of their wedding 40 years ago (he didn't) because she also needed it to get the certified copy of her marriage certificate from Georgia for her license renewal. I finally remembered I had a passport which also would have satisfied the new requirements but it needed to be renewed, and only a month earlier the fee to renew had just gotten a massive increase to $140 which I seriously did not have. \n\nNow imagine what it's like for any woman of a certain age who has been married multiple times\u2014three times, for instance, is not uncommon these days\u2014and who was foolish enough to adopt her husband's name each time. In order to get her license renewed she must acquire, if she hasn't bothered to save them or if in the course of many moves they just got lost, three separate marriage certificates from possibly three separate states or foreign countries just so she can get her driver's license renewed. \n\nNow I *had* to do whatever I had to do because I couldn't exist without a driver's license. But this is also what one has to do to get the simple *state-issued ID* required to vote if one doesn't have a license\u2014and pay $25 for it, I might add while finding someone to drive her to the motor vehicle office which, in rural areas of the country is likely to be quite far away and not reachable by public transport.\n\nAs Lorpius_Prime says below: \"First get everyone an ID, then feel free to make it a mandatory requirement to vote.\" \n\nBesides, let's stop the pretense of believing that after all these years this flurry of laws to change the ID requirements to vote had anything to do with [state legislators suddenly being concerned about voter fraud](http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/06/26/fox-downplayed-voter-id-concerns-but-republican/186721).

Its convenient for some to limit its definition to \"federal income tax\" because as AuditorTux points out, a lot of people get credits and deductions that allow them to pay nothing in federal income tax.  this (of course) misses a whole plethora of \"other\" taxes, such as state and local taxes, and all kinds of excise taxes which are generally considered  \"taxes.\"\n\n1. not only do the \"other\" taxes exist, but they're not paid proportionately to income at all.  The poorer pay a greater percentage of their income in \"other\" taxes for clothes, food (that is taxed, as not all is), gas, etc.  richer people save more, and pay a smaller percentage of their income in taxes for the same items.\n\n2. the wealthy are REALLY good at 1. getting the loopholes into the system and 2. exploiting them.  although Reddit loathes talking about things in practical terms, how hard would it be to write the tax code so that capital gains aren't considered income?  i could give you a very convincing argument, that in a global world money doesn't give a shit about national boundaries, and we rely on capital to power the economy the same way labor did 100 years ago.  \n\n3. i took a class in IPE a year or 2 back, and i seem to remember how well indexing worked with regards to the gold standard right before the Great Depression. when things start to go south, spending will go up, but taxes going up with it isn't going to help.  the government lacks flexibility to right the ship (so to speak) before it sinks.\n\nbut re: \"so people understand that if they want the government to do more, it has to be paid for\"\n\nif i put myself in your shoes, i can see that.  a minority of folks have \"entitlement fever,\" but we're largely a \"me\" society, not a \"we\" society (we didn't build this, I BUILT THIS!)   \n\nbut what if you put yourself in mine, where when you look out you see that even wealthy people support higher taxes to right the ship (A) and that for a lot of people IRL, higher taxation for more services is not the boogeyman that it's made out to be in some circles.  \n\n\n(a) http://www.cnbc.com/id/100335218/Majority_of_Wealthy_Support_Taxing_Themselves_Poll   ", "id": "t1_c8dq2rd", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "sixspeedtibby", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Sorry, but it was warranted.

I'm assuming you know how to work an amortization table, so I'll give you the parameters and you can double check the math yourself.\n\nSay Pete makes $2000 per month as a married father of two and his wife makes the same (this is as close to the standard median family as I can get with simple numbers).  His tax is 6.2% on his income or $124 per month.  He starts working at 25 and retires at 65 (again, for easy math).  He's going to die at 85 (above the life expectancy).  I'm going to round down interest to 2 decimals, just as a bank might.\n\nOver the course of his working life, he contributes $59,520 into the fund.  Now we just need to work out the interest rate that he could have gotten.\n\nLets start with 2%.  In this case, he would have $91,066 compounded monthly.  Not really a bad haul.  To \"withdraw\" all that cash within the next 20 years, assuming the same return on investment, he needs $460.69 per month.  Right now the [benefits at $1,230 per month](http://ssa-custhelp.ssa.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/13/~/average-monthly-social-security-benefit-for-a-retired-worker).  At 2%, its a good investment.  But that's less than the market has returned in [the last five years](http://observationsandnotes.blogspot.com/2009/03/average-annual-stock-market-return.html)\n\nWell, for Pete, what's the breakeven point where he would be better off having his own account?  4.96%.  You can look at that second link and see how that compares.\n\nLets go back to the 2%, but instead change his income to the 2013 limit - [$113,700](http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/quickfacts/prog_highlights/index.html).  What does this man need to get at 2% each month?  $2,182.59.  Obviously that won't happen.  So what's his break even interest rate?  0.15%.  Basically nothing - he could bury the money in his backyard and take it out evenly over 20 years and not be much better off than SS.  Heck, investing over the last five years would have been better, including the crash.\n\nNow, remember this is assuming you're only working from 25 to 65 without getting a raise ever.  The reason I showed the guy at the maximum is that as your income increases, the break-even rate gets lower and lower.

The only thing we needed was a bill to pass.\n\n&gt;We're unable to finance anything long-term,\n\nHuh?  Sure we can.  In fact, we can finance at a **negative interest rate**. That's right!  People will pay the government money to borrow from them.  Imagine if you got a negative interest rate from your credit card.  You could simply max out your credit, sit on the cash - or fix that leaking roof - and pay it back for less than you borrowed.  \n\n&gt;So, after we do, unemployment will skyrocket, the power of the dollar will fall. \n\nMuch wrong here.  First, the reason unemployment will likely go up is because the fiscal cliff included large spending cuts.  Spending cuts at a time of high unemployment will only reduce demand and slow growth.  And a dollar less in spending is more than a dollar lost in income because **interest rates are negative**. \n\nFurthermore, a slowdown in the economy from a reduction in demand causes *deflation*, not inflation.  The prices of goods tend to fall when these types of recessions occur, meaning the dollar gets 'stronger'.\n\nWhat will likely happen?  It depends on how long it takes for congress to pass another spending bill.  In the meantime, the economy will likely see a gradual slowdown the longer it takes.  It *could* cause a recession, but it's not likely unless the rest of the world starts dragging US down.  \n\nThe main problem with the cliff isn't because it's bad fiscal policy, though it is, but rather because the cuts are drastic and arbitrary.  \n\nJust to be clear, this is distinct from the 'debt ceiling' debate and the government shutdown from not passing a spending bill in the style of Gingrich.  \n\n", "id": "t1_c7x2590", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "urnbabyurn", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_16l8v6", "id": "t1_c7x2lkj", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_16l8v6", "selftext": "Some payments would be delayed.

Some contractors may not get paid - imagine a check written to Boeing not being mailed out.  It could be we fail to pay some bonds that mature.  It could be that government employees don't get pay checks.  \n\nThese issues individually don't sound like utter disaster given that the limit will eventually be raised and all debts settled.  But the real worry is that it makes the credit worthiness of the US questioned.  This would raise the cost of our debt, and cost billions in additional interest.  It could cause financial markets to panic, given US debt is the safest asset out there.  The economy could very easily go into recession.  \n\nI feel a bit self aware being like chicken little in regards to the debt ceiling, but more ho hum about the fiscal cliff.

Could you show me where that could be verified? Also, how would that money be appropriated? Assuming that there is a cap of 10% on out of pocket costs based on income, for a family that difference (between the cost of the insurance and other OOP costs - and 10% of their income) could be substantial. It could end up being a substantial amount of money, especially if there is no mandate and the wage earner(s) is/are self employed but not making a very high income. Because individual health insurance is quite expensive, often several times more expensive than per capita costs in a group plan. Do you understand what I am saying or are you just taking this on faith that things will somehow be logical and just. My main concern is that the cost of providing this cap will be huge, so huge it will face battles every year over appropriations. The cap has the potential to be astronomically large because health insurance is very expensive, few Americans pay directly for it or have had the experience of trying themselves to buy it,\n\nI wish that you were right **because so many people need it.** But I just don't see the government as being as generous as a lot of people who boost the ACA seem to think it is. As the hearings were starting for the ACA, the government was representing it in those hearings as a way to save the government money by taking people out of programs like Medicaid and putting them on private insurance. Since I didn't see the government planning on spending a lot more money in those hearings, I saw the government saying this would save THEM money and cure the free rider problem, I think there has to be a gotcha somewhere and its in the costs that are being dumped on both employers and families. Costs that are **much higher than they need to be, just so politicians can avoid taking responsibility** for something that politicians do everywhere else in the world. Address the rising costs of healthcare sensibly.\n\n**4/5 of all American families cannot afford to buy market rate insurance any more, without help, no matter how \"competitive\" it is.**\n\nThe ACA, by RE-arranging the deck chairs on the sinking ship of the private insurance model doomed us to a continued high administrative cost that is in and of itself, worthless. \n\nIt adds no value. As long as we keep that waste, we wont be able to afford healthcare for everybody. As soon as we buy healthcare services as a nation, rather than as individuals, we will save around a third, because our current system is the most expensive in the world because its the most needlessly complicated system in the world..and that change in and of itself makes it possible to pay for it out of taxes and eliminate bills to the end users, the patients. That would save a lot of money and take the burden off of employers to pay for this wildly increasing cost every year.

Assuming that there is a cap of 10% on out of pocket costs based on income, for a family that difference (between the cost of the insurance and other OOP costs - and 10% of their income) could be substantial. It could end up being a substantial amount of money, especially if there is no mandate and the wage earner(s) is/are self employed but not making a very high income. Because individual health insurance is quite expensive, often several times more expensive than per capita costs in a group plan. Do you understand what I am saying or are you just taking this on faith that things will somehow be logical and just. My main concern is that the cost of providing this cap will be huge, so huge it will face battles every year over appropriations. The cap has the potential to be astronomically large because health insurance is very expensive, few Americans pay directly for it or have had the experience of trying themselves to buy it,\n\nI wish that you were right **because so many people need it.** But I just don't see the government as being as generous as a lot of people who boost the ACA seem to think it is. As the hearings were starting for the ACA, the government was representing it in those hearings as a way to save the government money by taking people out of programs like Medicaid and putting them on private insurance. Since I didn't see the government planning on spending a lot more money in those hearings, I saw the government saying this would save THEM money and cure the free rider problem, I think there has to be a gotcha somewhere and its in the costs that are being dumped on both employers and families. Costs that are **much higher than they need to be, just so politicians can avoid taking responsibility** for something that politicians do everywhere else in the world. Address the rising costs of healthcare sensibly.\n\n**4/5 of all American families cannot afford to buy market rate insurance any more, without help, no matter how \"competitive\" it is.**\n\nThe ACA, by RE-arranging the deck chairs on the sinking ship of the private insurance model doomed us to a continued high administrative cost that is in and of itself, worthless. \n\nIt adds no value. As long as we keep that waste, we wont be able to afford healthcare for everybody. As soon as we buy healthcare services as a nation, rather than as individuals, we will save around a third, because our current system is the most expensive in the world because its the most needlessly complicated system in the world..and that change in and of itself makes it possible to pay for it out of taxes and eliminate bills to the end users, the patients. That would save a lot of money and take the burden off of employers to pay for this wildly increasing cost every year.

Could you show me where that could be verified? Also, how would that money be appropriated? Assuming that there is a cap of 10% on out of pocket costs based on income, for a family that difference (between the cost of the insurance and other OOP costs - and 10% of their income) could be substantial. It could end up being a substantial amount of money, especially if there is no mandate and the wage earner(s) is/are self employed but not making a very high income. Because individual health insurance is quite expensive, often several times more expensive than per capita costs in a group plan. Do you understand what I am saying or are you just taking this on faith that things will somehow be logical and just. My main concern is that the cost of providing this cap will be huge, so huge it will face battles every year over appropriations. The cap has the potential to be astronomically large because health insurance is very expensive, few Americans pay directly for it or have had the experience of trying themselves to buy it,\n\nI wish that you were right **because so many people need it.** But I just don't see the government as being as generous as a lot of people who boost the ACA seem to think it is. As the hearings were starting for the ACA, the government was representing it in those hearings as a way to save the government money by taking people out of programs like Medicaid and putting them on private insurance. Since I didn't see the government planning on spending a lot more money in those hearings, I saw the government saying this would save THEM money and cure the free rider problem, I think there has to be a gotcha somewhere and its in the costs that are being dumped on both employers and families. Costs that are **much higher than they need to be, just so politicians can avoid taking responsibility** for something that politicians do everywhere else in the world. Address the rising costs of healthcare sensibly.\n\n**4/5 of all American families cannot afford to buy market rate insurance any more, without help, no matter how \"competitive\" it is.**\n\nThe ACA, by RE-arranging the deck chairs on the sinking ship of the private insurance model doomed us to a continued high administrative cost that is in and of itself, worthless. \n\nIt adds no value. As long as we keep that waste, we wont be able to afford healthcare for everybody. As soon as we buy healthcare services as a nation, rather than as individuals, we will save around a third, because our current system is the most expensive in the world because its the most needlessly complicated system in the world..and that change in and of itself makes it possible to pay for it out of taxes and eliminate bills to the end users, the patients. That would save a lot of money and take the burden off of employers to pay for this wildly increasing cost every year.

Making the per month cost much more than 10% of their income?

Neither I nor the people being discussed could possibly care less).\n\nOr, I could be a little more honest and say that I was paraphrasing.  Maybe *innocent* life is the most deserving of protection, but once you start shooting people, you're not innocent anymore.  This also explains the homeless guy; he had his chance, he's no longer innocent, fuck 'im.\n\nA 3rd option is to say it's about relative weights.  Life is the highest concern, but when you weigh life vs. life, things change a little.  If you took a life, for example, your life is weighed against the one you took, as well as the possibility you'll do it again, and then we're off to the races with a larger discussion about crime and punishment.

But all of that fails in the face of *this is a life, that we are actively deciding to take.*  \n\nAnd if she feels that much animosity, she can have the baby and give it up for adoption.  Then add in the you-shouldn't-have-gotten-pregnant trope, and you pretty much have the conservative mindset.

This also explains the homeless guy; he had his chance, he's no longer innocent, fuck 'im.\n\nA 3rd option is to say it's about relative weights.  Life is the highest concern, but when you weigh life vs. life, things change a little.  If you took a life, for example, your life is weighed against the one you took, as well as the possibility you'll do it again, and then we're off to the races with a larger discussion about crime and punishment.

The simplest is simply to say that while life is the highest right, it may be taken away if you are undeserving, like any other right (let's not get into the finer philosophical points of rights vs. privileges.  Neither I nor the people being discussed could possibly care less).\n\nOr, I could be a little more honest and say that I was paraphrasing.  Maybe *innocent* life is the most deserving of protection, but once you start shooting people, you're not innocent anymore.  This also explains the homeless guy; he had his chance, he's no longer innocent, fuck 'im.\n\nA 3rd option is to say it's about relative weights.  Life is the highest concern, but when you weigh life vs. life, things change a little.  If you took a life, for example, your life is weighed against the one you took, as well as the possibility you'll do it again, and then we're off to the races with a larger discussion about crime and punishment.

But all of that fails in the face of *this is a life, that we are actively deciding to take.*  \n\nAnd if she feels that much animosity, she can have the baby and give it up for adoption.  Then add in the you-shouldn't-have-gotten-pregnant trope, and you pretty much have the conservative mindset.
