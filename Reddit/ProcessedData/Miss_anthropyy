It's hard to say they'll be \"absorbed\" as they're not a party per se, but their more extreme attempts at influencing governance will be less and less successful if the economy recovers and subsequent tax revenue is high enough to pay down the debt.\n\nBtw, where are you studying out of curiosity?", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ce1iloi", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1387024585", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t3_1str4j", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1428140991, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1str4j", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ce1b8x0", "author_flair_text": "[Poli Sci Grad Student][Independent]", "created_utc": "1386990009", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I live in a state where I have to disclose my mental health records if I want to own a gun.  I've been hospitalized for mental health reasons before.  There is basically no chance that I will ever be able to own a gun in this state (though I have not tried to apply).  \n\nI don't think that's fair.  At the same time, I don't know that I would want to keep a gun in my house.  I really want one for personal protection, but there was a time in my life where my parents had to lock up all the knives in the house because I would use them to self-harm.  A gun would be way too much of a risk - I might kill myself.\n\nThere is no chance I would ever turn that weapon on someone else.\n\nI always wanted to know my way around guns, as a practical sort of information.  My goal is that if I'm around a gun, I should be able to unload it and clear the chamber.  I think that's a basic safety measure all people should know.  I enjoy shooting and want to improve my skills.  I wonder at the fairness of a system that will allow me to go to a range and rent a weapon to use there whenever I want, but I couldn't get my own and keep it in my home.  \n\nI think that gun laws are fine the way they are now.  People should be licensed to own a weapon, passing a basic background check; and if they wish to carry (open or concealed) they should pass a test making sure they know their way around a weapon.  \n\nLimitations on what sort of weapons they should own is just silly.  Quite simply, mass shootings are not something that happens often enough to justify limiting the freedoms of the entire American populace in a misguided effort to prevent one from happening again.  If you want to commit a crime bad enough, you'll find a way.  We're living in an era where people have weaponized skyscrapers.  Who the fuck are we kidding?\n\nI don't know why there's this obsession that we could have stopped it.  We do this every time.  Listen, sometimes freaky shit happens that *could not* have been prevented.  At all.  We do not know enough about what happened at Sandy Hook to make any sort of speculation there... we're still trying to work out the specifics of what happened.  But if someone has not been flagged for mental health reasons by the system, and they haven't committed a crime... well there's no reason they can't own and even carry a weapon.  \n\nSo... guess where the problem is, then?  Not in guns.  Guns are a red herring.  And a look at any statistics will show you that assault rifles kill far fewer people than pistols do.  \n\nI'm falling asleep at the keyboard so I'm off to bed.  I think I rambled off-topic.

There will be a link to internships there - probably under \"Contact us\" or something similar.  Most have a main drop-down menu, and it will be one of those links.

They are too proud to give in on certain demands, and too hurt to put down their missiles.  \n\nI don't mean to belittle their complaints; both have legitimate concerns, there have been losses on both sides.  Many civilians *do* want peace.  But the politicians of both groups behave like children.\n\nBoth sides are going to have to give some things up.

Palestine needs to realize that its \"right of return\" is too broad: they want to extend it to all the refugees and their descendants, and there just isn't enough room.  Israel needs to bite the bullet and deal with Hamas or Hamas-affiliated organizations (which would be easier if they control a sovereign nation, I think; this builds legitimacy and if they're not fighting Israel for territory, well, there goes most of the problem).  \n\nBoth parties need to be bitch-slapped and learn the meaning of the word \"compromise.\"  Until then, nothing will happen.\n\nBut expecting the two groups to be able to share the same space in any sort of reasonable time frame is highly unrealistic.  \n\n", "id": "t1_c7fhyk0", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Miss_anthropyy", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c7fmvt0", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "mothereffingteresa", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_14pwrr", "selftext": "&gt;Why not?\n\ndecades of bad blood on both sides causing any democratic process to dissolve into mutually antagonistic ethnic/religious based blocks, causing neither party to be satisfied.\n\nseriously, at any other time in history, any population acting as the Palestinians have towards a much militarily stronger people would have been pushed off the land or flat out slaughtered. honestly the best somewhat likely solution is for egypt, jordan, and whatever becomes of syria to get the concentrated palestinian areas on their borders and then absorb the people living there into their own nations.\n\nunfortunately, the situation is likely to continue until one group or another is forced out totally.", "id": "t1_c7fqty4", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "C-LAR", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c7fmvt0", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430659217, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7fqty4", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1355368046", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c7fhyk0", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1430657355, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; Do you genuinely believe that they can live together, peacefully, in one state? \n\nWhy not?\n\n&gt;  Palestine needs to realize that its \"right of return\" is too broad: they want to extend it to all the refugees and their descendants, and there just isn't enough room.\n\nI got property in Eastern Europe back that was expropriated by the Russians.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_cliff),\n\n&gt; In the United States, the fiscal cliff is a term used to refer to the economic effects that could result in tax increases, spending cuts and a corresponding reduction in the US budget deficit beginning in 2013 if existing laws are not changed by the end of 2012. The deficit\u2014the difference between what the government takes in and what it spends\u2014is expected to be reduced by roughly half beginning in the first days of 2013. This sharp decrease in the deficit in such a short period of time is known as the fiscal cliff. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the sudden reduction will probably lead to a recession in early 2013 with the pace of economic activity picking up by late 2013.\n\n\n\nWhether we go off the \"cliff\" or find a way to curb it, it is not the end of the world.   I am not an economics-inclined person, so when I heard of it I hurriedly asked a few of my friends who are, who assured me that it's really not a big deal.  (If I am wrong in saying that, I blame them.)  But as I understand it it's just the doomsday flavor of the week.  Cliff or no cliff, any change that happens will be gradual, and the government will probably counteract it in some way. \n\n[Crappy source, forgive me](http://bonds.about.com/od/Issues-in-the-News/a/What-Is-The-Fiscal-Cliff.htm):\n\n&gt; In dealing with the fiscal cliff, U.S. lawmakers have a choice among three options, none of which are particularly attractive:\n\n* They can let the current policy scheduled for the beginning of 2013 \u2013 which features a number of tax increases and spending cuts that are expected to weigh heavily on growth and possibly drive the economy back into a recession \u2013 go into effect. The plus side: the deficit, as a percentage of GDP, would be cut in half.\n\n* They can cancel some or all of the scheduled tax increases and spending cuts, which would add to the deficit and increase the odds that the United States could face a crisis similar to that which is occurring in Europe. The flip side of this, of course, is that the United States' debt will continue to grow.\n\n* They could take a middle course, opting for an approach that would address the budget issues to a limited extent, but that would have a more modest impact on growth.\n\n\n\n&gt; ...Having said this, it's important to keep in mind that while the term \u201ccliff\u201d indicates an immediate disaster at the beginning of 2013, the impact of the changes - while destructive over a full year - will be gradual at first. What's more, Congress can act to change laws retroactively after the deadline. As a result, the fiscal cliff won't necessarily be an impediment to growth even if Congress doesn't address the issue until after 2013 has already begun. \n", "id": "t1_c7elg4y", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Miss_anthropyy", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_14n0ad", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1430638767, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_14n0ad", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7elg4y", "author_flair_text": "[Poli Sci Grad Student][Independent]", "created_utc": "1355194120", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}
