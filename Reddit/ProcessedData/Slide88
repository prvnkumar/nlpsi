The reason many point to spending cuts is because of practicality. If you increase revenue by taxation you're going to lessen the tax base as less activity occurs, and potentially have similar rev or small gains in revenue. However, decreasing spending will also affect the economy(more per $ than a $ of tax increase would I believe). The true way to solve this is with economic recovery which grows the revenue as more activity is taxed and lessens the expenditures needed. *How we get there is the tough part.* The reason I support cuts over tax increases is because I feel that policy helps us towards our end goal of econ. recovery of the private sector more than the better short term solution of tax increases and unchanged spending.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_19ceh5", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8mwt9a", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1362010388", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "twim19", "id": "t1_c8mtfvi", "parent_id": "t1_c8mrhli", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431430351, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Guess I'm a little confused still.

The reason many point to spending cuts is because of practicality. If you increase revenue by taxation you're going to lessen the tax base as less activity occurs, and potentially have similar rev or small gains in revenue. However, decreasing spending will also affect the economy(more per $ than a $ of tax increase would I believe). The true way to solve this is with economic recovery which grows the revenue as more activity is taxed and lessens the expenditures needed. *How we get there is the tough part.* The reason I support cuts over tax increases is because I feel that policy helps us towards our end goal of econ. recovery of the private sector more than the better short term solution of tax increases and unchanged spending.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_19ceh5", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8mwt9a", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1362010388", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "twim19", "id": "t1_c8mtfvi", "parent_id": "t1_c8mrhli", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431430351, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Guess I'm a little confused still.

Country A gives Company X a reduced tax rate and a free plot of land to incentivize Company X to build the factory there.

As the saying goes, \"Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.\" Every society that has fallen to tyranny has done so by giving up (or having taken away) its will and ability to resist.\n\nIt is easy to handwave away the need for second amendment underneath such excuses as \"we would have no chance against tanks, missiles, planes, etc. anyway.\" To say so is quite contradictory to the values on which the Constitution was written. The USA is unique with respect to the fact that it was born directly from tyranny and its government specifically constructed to deter tyranny, and no amendment is more symbolic of that particular ideal than the second. \n\nIn many ways, the second amendment represents the power by which the American people are superior to their government. The Constitution specifies that the government derives its power from the consent of the people, and specifically empowers them against their government through the second amendment.", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Slide88", "id": "t1_c7ug0um", "parent_id": "t3_16avwh", "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1435647464, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7ug0um", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357830376", "distinguished": null, "ups": 4}
