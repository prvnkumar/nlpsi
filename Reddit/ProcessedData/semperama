Since there is a limited amount of space for roads, companies make deals with each other--\"I'll build my roads over here and you build your roads over there and we'll agree to stay out of each other's space.\" Then certain companies will have monopolies on roads in certain areas and they will likely discuss with neighboring companies to fix prices.\n\nEveryone in this thread is talking like companies could just come in and build new roads wherever they want. There is a limited amount of space available for roads, especially when you get into cities where building more roads would require knocking down existing structures or creating road networks so complex that they would be a nightmare. What would happen in a downtown area? You can't just build more roads there. Same goes for a residential neighborhood or even most suburbs. Yeah, maybe you can build multiple roads from city A to city B, but once you get within city limits, there isn't the space and it would be a logistical nightmare, so it would likely just involve one company owning all the roads in a city.", "id": "t1_c8ea70a", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "semperama", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c8eaw5o", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Can you explain to me how government involvement causes a monopoly?\n\nAlso, can you address my concerns about limited space for roads and the potential for private roads to end up the same way as cable?", "id": "t1_c8eaxu9", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "semperama", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c8eipo2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c8eaxu9", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431281721, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;Can you explain to me how government involvement causes a monopoly?\n\nWell, typically it involves direct statutory intervention making it illegal to compete such as the United States Postal Service.  Roughly 18 USC \u00a7 1693 et seq.  \n\nOther government involvement which creates monopoly or oligopoly are rules and regulations which make it more expensive or otherwise difficult to start or operate a business in an area.  \n\nFor example, the regulations on car manufacturers in Michigan and Detroit has made it so that only the big 3 have existed in those areas; this has created more of a monopsony or oligopsony qua automotive jobs.  \n\nSame problem, though.  \n\nAlso regulation of internet access providers and health and car insurance has created oligopoly results in many states and complete monopoly results for comcast in many areas.  \n\n----\n&gt;Also, can you address my concerns about limited space for roads and the potential for private roads to end up the same way as cable?\n\nOh sure.  You're right that there are limited areas for roads, however, the market will handle it.  If the market cannot handle it, it is the proper role of the government to destroy monopolies.  If we had a good government, it would be limited to its proper roles; instead it is creating and assisting monopolies.  \n\nBut in a free market capitalism, if someone tried to monopolize the roads and charge monopoly prices, he would be destroyed by his customers, competitors or the government very quickly.

How can the demand *increase* when right now 100% of children are guaranteed education? You can't increase from 100%, and changing the price from \"free\" to \"not free\" is certainly not going to *increase* demand. \n\n&gt;(2) considering how much of our taxes go to funding schools (roughly $10,000 a year per student depending on which state you live in), that the savings in taxes could be more than enough to allow most people to afford private schooling.\n\nYou can't just say that because the average cost in taxes per student is $10,000 that everyone will now have $10,000 back that they will be able to put toward school. What about families below the poverty line that pay very little in taxes? They will not see anywhere close to that amount of savings. And that's assuming that the various governments will just return that tax money to the people rather than simply using it for other purposes, which is the most likely scenario, since tax money is usually not specifically earmarked for the purpose of education. And it's also assuming that if a family in poverty got $10,000 in tax money back that they would use it on education rather than things that are more necessary to them at that exact moment, like food, clothing, better living arrangements, etc. \n\n&gt;Secondly, I agree with your point that even then, the poorest couldn't afford it. In this case, it would be appropriate for the government to subsidize education (possibly through a voucher system) for the poor, meaning that the poor would still be able to go to the more efficient and generally effective private schools.\n\nThen wouldn't you have the same problem that we have now with higher education? The government helps bridge the gap for those that can't afford school, and that drives up prices, making it so less and less people can afford it, which means the government has to subsidize more and more, until prices are exorbitant?", "id": "t1_c8e9v7g", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "semperama", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c8e7ogl", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431277436, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1360729139, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8e9v7g", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1360728099", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}

I'll try not to make this an ideological argument and just point out the factual errors of this comment and the places where you really, really should have cited a source.\n\n&gt;The goal of a corporation, that is the entire company, is to make money. To have net revenue greater than net expense by providing goods or services, or whatever people will pay them for. That is not, however, the goals of the PEOPLE who run the companies. They all have different goals, and making money is not the entire goal, at least for most.\n\nThis is a very bold claim that really, really needs a source. But you won't find one, because that would be impossible to document or prove. Therefore, you probably shouldn't claim it. Also, as you said, people make up corporations, so if the goal of the corporation is to make money, doesn't it follow that the goal of the people who run it is to make money? Because corporations are not separate entities with their own desires, right? They are made up by people and guided by the decisions and desires of those people.\n\n&gt;No one 'needs' to play Starcraft. No one needs to play games at all, even though they want to. And they certainly don't need constant new titles coming out every month, as you could probably entertain yourself with all the games that have ever been made up until now for the rest of your life.\n\nFalse. Why do you think a new Call of Duty game comes out every year? Consumers are always hungry for the new and shiny, and a corporation, who wants to maximize profits, will happily obliged. That is not to say they don't enjoy making games. I'm sure they do. But if their primary goal was just making good games, would they make a new Call of Duty every year, or would they wait a couple years and try to make a new, different, better game? Just because the people at a company enjoy what they do doesn't make it any less true that it's ultimately about the bottom line.\n\n&gt; Why do you think the US is the greatest country in the world?\n\nAccording to whom/what?\n\n&gt;The same goes for large corporations, they are like any big group of people who have similar interests working towards a common goal. Some people who run corporations do love to make money, but even if they do, they aren't evil about it.\n\nDefine \"evil\". Back up this claim.\n\n&gt;What would you rather do, buy a whole bunch of lottery tickets and hope to score millions, or get a steady, 9-5 job with tenure? That question was rhetorical, of course you would prefer the latter.\n\nAre you arguing that people in general would rather work 40 hours a week and make a steady income than win millions and not have to work? Can you back up this claim?\n\n&gt;Governments are not completely controlled by corporations. It is true that many people in the government are part of the upper class in the US, the same class that many business executives are a part of. They are friends, they know each other, just as I know a lot of people in high school because I am in high school, but not many people who work in the west part of town, because I don't live there.\n\nPeople don't argue that corporations run the government because they all \"know\" each other. Money has an extreme amount of power in American government, and the people with the most money have the most power. That's why people say corporations run the government.\n\n&gt;Obama literally can't do things that people don't want him to do. Bush couldn't, Clinton couldn't, no president or any other member of the government can. They have rules specially laid out for them for their job, and ultimately have to answer to Congress or the Supreme Court anyways.\n\nIn theory, yes. In practice, no. First of all, \"the people\" is not a homogeneous entity, so I'll assume you are talking about the *majority* of the people. So your assertion is that the president cannot do something that the majority of people don't want because he is answerable to Congress and the Supreme Court?\n\nWhat about the fact that [the President has, on 125 occasions, carried out military action without the approval of Congress?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war_by_the_United_States#Other_undeclared_wars)\n\nAnd what if Congress supports the President in something, but the majority of the people oppose it? Laws like the Patriot Act, NDAA, etc. show that popular opinion may not make much difference. \n\nSo we should just vote for better representatives then, right? Yeah, if only it were that easier. Often, there is a lack of meaningful choices (for example, maybe you hated the Patriot Act under Bush and then voted for Obama...but he proceeded to extend it). Also, gerrymandering.\n\nPersonally, I think that neither this question nor this response is appropriate for this subreddit. The \"question\" is not really a question but a rant, and this response is all opinion, none of it backed up by sources and much of it factually incorrect.

You can't have it both ways.\n\nA tax on consumption naturally discourages it, but there are two other factors brought in.  One, there is more income for someone to consume with (no more income taxes, plus the prebate) and the suppliers of those items also no longer have taxes, so prices will go down.  IIRC, they picked their rate as it was the average tax rate baked into the cost of things.\n\nIn the end, you end up with prices stabilizing back to where they were (or less or more, depending on the item) but each item will still have its own demand price inelasticity - iPhones, for example, might not be impacted by a higher price, but cans of tomato sauce might be.\n\nConsumption is a large part of our economy, but many economists argue that we consume too much and save far too little.  Because we save too little, when there is a shock to a person, we typically rely upon debt to bridge that gap.  Debt incurs interest, which is essentially stealing from the future consumption for today (less money to spend in the future).  Savings is the opposite of that - you bypass consumption today for the future.

You can't have it both ways.", "id": "t1_c86xqu0", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "semperama", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_17l0e0", "selftext": "&gt;This whole time you've argued that the tax will discourage consumption, and now that I've told you that discouraging consumption is bad, all of a sudden the tax doesn't discourage consumption? You can't have it both ways.\n\nA tax on consumption naturally discourages it, but there are two other factors brought in.  One, there is more income for someone to consume with (no more income taxes, plus the prebate) and the suppliers of those items also no longer have taxes, so prices will go down.  IIRC, they picked their rate as it was the average tax rate baked into the cost of things.\n\nIn the end, you end up with prices stabilizing back to where they were (or less or more, depending on the item) but each item will still have its own demand price inelasticity - iPhones, for example, might not be impacted by a higher price, but cans of tomato sauce might be.\n\nConsumption is a large part of our economy, but many economists argue that we consume too much and save far too little.  Because we save too little, when there is a shock to a person, we typically rely upon debt to bridge that gap.  Debt incurs interest, which is essentially stealing from the future consumption for today (less money to spend in the future).  Savings is the opposite of that - you bypass consumption today for the future.  Savings is seen as a benefit because it leads to stability... not to mention the ability for people to consume things they ordinarily wouldn't be able to (not consuming 1 Big Mac each day allows someone to go and consume a 5-star dinner if they wait long enough).\n\nDoes that make sense?

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_17g9r9", "selftext": "\"Welfare\" is a broad term, and people often use it as a catch-all when it really shouldn't be. There are many different types of government assistance, and they are all very different in function, purpose, length of time, and eligibility.\n\nGenerally however, when people think of welfare, they are thinking of a program called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). Recipients of TANF can only collect for two years without working. If a recipient has not found work after two years (30 hours/week for single parents and 35-55 hours/week for double parent families), the benefits stop. Also, there is a lifetime limit of five years, so even if you are working, you can only collect benefits for a maximum of five years in your whole life (even if those years are split up--the clock doesn't restart). \n\nAs far as I know, the states cannot loosen these requirements, but they can tighten them, and many do. Many states also have requirements that they have to prove they have been looking for jobs and have participated in job programs. Some require the recipients to have worked for a certain amount of time over a number of years to qualify. \n\nThe rules for other benefits are similar. A person can collect unemployment, but only if they have worked in the past and only if they stopped working through no fault of their own, and most states have a limit of about 26 weeks for how long you can collect benefits. \n\nFor the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, or food stamps), able-bodied adults without dependents can only collect for three months in a 36 month period if they are not working at least 20 hours or attending some kind of job training.\n\nSo, in short, no. A person cannot, generally, sit at home all day and do nothing and collect welfare. They may be able to do it for a very, very short amount of time, but certainly not forever.

Require a license to practice prostitution, yearly evaluations to maintain those licenses (ensure they know safe sex methods to cut down on disease, psychiatric/mental health evaluations to ensure they're doing it freely, etc.), ensure that \"pimps\" (whatever their proper, legal name would be) are also registered and kept tabs on (such that it would still be illegal to run a prostitution ring without certification or whatever). \n\nTreat prostitutes the same way we treat strippers.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_16qi6a", "selftext": "&gt;I can't imagine a realistic scenario where the government would launch a large scale offensive on the US people.\n\nTyranny is not (necessarily) the government *attacking* its people. It is the government *oppressing* its people and not giving them a say in the government or a means to affect change. There could theoretically come a time when the government has seized so much power that it can do whatever it wants, leaving the people effectively powerless. In this instance, we might call for a revolution. Revolutions by their very nature are almost always fighting against the full power and wealth of the government, but somehow they still manage to succeed in many cases.\n\nThe military could easily be outnumbered, and many who are currently in the military may even decide to fight on the side of the revolutionaries. The government probably would not be able to use nuclear weapons or anything like that, because most fighting would probably be centered around the Capital, and they would effectively be dropping bombs on themselves.\n\nIn short, the American people would not be so powerless in a revolution against a tyrannical government as you seem to think.\n\nAs for the assertion that tyranny is only a problem in the 1700s, that's not true. Many countries in the world face tyranny today, and it is not outside the realm of possibility that the US could face it someday. The making of laws requires some level of foresight. You can't just look at the current situation and say, \"we're good\". You have to plan for the future. In the event (however unlikely or likely you think it is) that the government does gain way too much power and begins asserting uncomfortable levels of control over the people, it would be too late to make a law giving the people the right to defend themselves.

So we don't have a need to feel persecuted to identify with our founding father or to feel more Canadian. \n\nWhen you teach everyone that rebellion and liberty are American traits you can't be surprised when some go shopping for oppressive tyrants. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_16qi6a", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7yxe6z", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1358474782", "ups": 0, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c7yg0qe", "score": 11, "retrieved_on": 1430990932, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yet why are Americans, more than the citizens of any other developed nation, so preoccupied with the possibility that their government might one day begin to start restricting their rights and personal freedoms?", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7yimqb", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1358425597", "ups": 11, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_16qi6a", "id": "t1_c7yk3tv", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "kryses", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c7yg0qe", "score": 8, "retrieved_on": 1430991626, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Just to add to your point, there is a [relatively recent example of the 2nd amendment being used for the purpose of repelling tyranny.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Athens_%281946%29)", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7yk3tv", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1358433849", "ups": 8, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_16qi6a", "id": "t1_c7yx5uu", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c7yg0qe", "score": -2, "retrieved_on": 1430997987, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;Many countries in the world face tyranny today\n\nAre any of them western democracies? \n\n&gt;You have to plan for the future.\n\nTrue, but you have to plan for all of the possible futures based on their chance of happening.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_16qi6a", "selftext": "&gt;1. I consider this paranoia. Do you believe that every other country with gun control will eventually be overridden with a tyrannical government? I don't. This type of thinking is borderline conspiracy. The U.S. was founded under circumstances that caused the founding fathers to believe that firearms and a militia were essential for a country to survive, and because that ended up in the constitution, people will stick to it as if it were their religion. Most other developed countries are moving on.\n\n\"Moving on\"? Do you think tyranny is a thing of the past? Something that only happened in the 1700s? What about Middle Eastern countries? Those revolts are happening *today*. I don't know how people can think that tyranny is something that only happened in 1700s England or France. The cycle of tyranny and revolution is a *constant* all around the world and throughout history. I find it very odd to suggest that trying to learn from history and not repeat its mistakes is \"conspiracy\". The very definition of conspiracy implies little evidence and there are *massive* amounts of evidence of the abuses of government and the havoc that can wreak on people.\n\nAlso, it's not that \"every other country with gun control will eventually be overran with a tyrannical government\". It's that every country with strict gun control that DOES find itself overran will have no way to defend itself against that government. This point must be driven home: **The 2nd amendment does not prevent tyranny.
