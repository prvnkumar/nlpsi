If a company chooses not to sell their product to another company that will not meet them half-way, they find another buyer. But what if all buyers are offering them the same price? And what if it's just not profitable to them to sell at the going rate, as they cannot even meet their operating expenses? The company would fail and be dissolved, replaced by one that can offer the product at a price that is acceptable.\n\nThe problem is that the same model cannot apply to people, and suggesting that it should raises some interesting moral questions. There is only so much a person can \"reduce their operating costs\" (e.g., budget their pay); when they fail, there is much more at stake than the existence of a corporate entity as in the above example. \n\nIt is also a \"bygone conclusion\" that the federal minimum wage does not meet the minimum living wage in the vast majority of the country--that is, it is exceedingly difficult to eke by on the going rate. There is a surplus of labor, yes, but it's not like people as a collective can choose not to work in our economy (as a company can choose not to do business with another). Their very survival--and their dependents'--hinges on it, in fact.\n\nSo people bargain away more of their time out of necessity, often working 60+ hours a week to meet their expenses--ironically, further devaluing their own labor! The problem is that time and energy are limited resources. The equilibrium we have reached is, in many cases, pushing the boundaries of what is physically possible to endure.\n\nI guess my question is this: How does one individually negotiate salary in this scenario? One person's labor is infinitely replaceable due to the necessity of each person to survive. There is little argument amongst the producers of labor that their resource is being undervalued in general; the problem is not disagreement over this fact, it is the unwillingness of employers to accept even an infinitesimal decrease in their margins of profit for the benefit of their workers. What solution, then, do you propose short of unionization? Is a cartel justifiable in this instance, as compensation is plummeting toward the bare minimum of what is needed to survive? If not, why not?\n\nThis is also human problem, unlike the macroeconomic problem of cartels; to conflate the two beyond a preliminary definition is to objectify laborers, turning them into nothing more than another raw material to be used in production.

ObamaCare would deny all Medicaid funds for noncompliant states.\n\nThe Supreme Court accepted this argument, ruling the Medicaid expansion as unduly coercive of the States and beyond the federal government's spending power in a 7-2 ruling. Art. I s. 8 gives the federal government the power to \"provide for the common Defense and General Welfare of the United States,\" and the courts have interpreted that to mean the federal government can spend however it wants, but it can't coerce the state. In South Dakota v. Dole, the court held that Congress can use the spending power to encourage uniformity in state drinking ages by withholding state highway funds as \"mild encouragement.\" The argument for the Medicaid expansion is that here, the Affordable Care Act withdrew ALL Medicaid funds--and if that's not coercive, then what is? The other argument would be that this \"coercion\" limit isn't in the text of the constitution and that Medicaid is only 25% of a state's total budget, so it's not like it's 100%. IMO it's a weak argument, which is why seven justices found it unconstitutional.\n\n**The worst arguments**\n&gt;2)         Threatens the Notion of Limited Government \u2013 The individual mandate would be a grant of limitless legislative and regulatory power.  This violates the doctrine of enumerated powers in which Congress is given few and specific legislative powers.\n\nThis doesn't actually make an argument--more like it piggybacks the commerce clause argument. But if you made it in court, it would be dismissed for failure to state a claim.\n\n&gt; 4)         Rewrites Contract Law \u2013 The individual mandate renders the purchase of health insurance to be compulsory.  For centuries, it has been understood that a contract is valid only if all parties voluntarily and mutually assent to its terms\n\nAgain, fails to state a claim. Contract law isn't protected by the Constitution.\n\n&gt; 5)         Charges a Financial Penalty to Regulate Behavior \u2013 ObamaCare imposes a financial penalty on those that fail to purchase health insurance.  The Constitution does not grant Congress an independent power to tax for the general welfare and may not use taxation as a means to regulate activity, unless that regulation is authorized by the Constitution.\n\nArt. 1 s. 8: \"Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay Debts and provide for the common Defense and General Welfare of the United States.\" It's pretty obvious that you can tax as a means of regulation--the federal government has been doing it since 1789 with taxes on carriages.\n\nPoint six makes a similar (though more sophisticated) argument that is also easily defeated by noting the broad grant of power given by the taxing clause and 16th amendment.\n\n&gt; 10)       It\u2019s Not Just Unconstitutional\n\nThis is circular; it doesn't make an argument, much less state a claim.\n\n**The argument that could have gone either way**\n\n&gt; 1)         Exceeds the Scope of the Commerce Clause and 9) the Necessary and Proper clause\n\nThe most famous argument from NFID v. Sebelius, and an argument that the court accepted.\n\n*The argument for it being within the commerce clause:*\n\n*Raich v. Gonzales* held that Congress can regulate noneconomic local activity if that regulation is necessary for the more general regulation of interstate commerce (pursuant to the commerce clause as expanded by the necessary and proper clause)--In Raich, a federal law prohibiting growing weed in your own backyard for your own use was held constitutional as within Congress' power to \"regulate interstate commerce.\"\n\nThe same argument goes for the individual mandate: By forcing folks to buy insurance, you are regulating a scheme of interstate commerce--the national health insurance market--and addressing moral hazard to reduce nationwide premiums.\n\n*The argument for it being beyond the commerce clause:*\n\nThere has never been a case saying that Congress can create commercial activity so that it can regulate it--so it's a new issue for the court to decide, and as a new issue, it seems to countradict the language of the Commerce Clause--you can't regulate what's not there, after all. I mean, if the government can force you to buy stuff, then effectively there is NO limit whatsoever on the commerce clause--Congress can make you buy anything. And a commerce clause without limitation makes no sense, since why else would the Constitution give all these other grants of federal power if Congress could justify any law under the Commerce clause?\n\n*The constitutional retort*\n\nThis distinction between activity and inactivity is not in the case law--it's kind of pulled out of thin air. Besides, people who don't buy health insurance ARE active--by not purchasing health insurance, they drive premiums WAY up when they use emergency rooms on the taxpayers' dollar.\n\nUltimately, the Court decided it was beyond the power of the commerce clause, but within the (almost infinite) taxing power.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;&gt;ObamaCare imposes a financial penalty on those that fail to purchase health insurance.\n\n&gt;It's pretty obvious that you can tax as a means of regulation--the federal government has been doing it since 1789 with taxes on carriages.\n\nThis is a bit different though. Regulatory taxes generally involve a tax on a good, service, or transaction. In this case, there is no good, service, or transaction being taxed. Rather, it is a tax on the *existence of a person*.

The employment figures of brits rose due to the largest exit of brits since the war.  \n\nThe privatisations did not succeed until the late 90's when markets were regulated and opened to competition. Inbetween it was a disaster where profits disappeared off shore to major shareholders, increased government subsidies in terms of tax breaks and in some cases like Rail poorer service with increased government money and continued collapse of the manufacturing sector for parts etc.  Pension funds did do well but that was because the companies were grossly undervalue, unfortunately the companies make profits the easy way, by firing brits, and moving jobs elsewhere. \n\nElectricity/gas prices fell due to increase competition in the late 90's, the government still foots the network bill though and the only reason that happens is the connection to france (the infamous cheap nuclear reactor just for when britains make a cup of tea before the soaps)  which is irrelevant to privatisation and more to do with the EU.\n\nThe wages from the financial powerhouse raised the median income but does not allow for the massive job losses and long slow recovery.

Scandinavia, not really comparable but outstrip the big players in every facet from semi-privatisation of state companies to social welfare and corporate responsibility (4/5 fold increase). The US has seen a lowering of the wage for the majority since the late 70's, and the minority (1%ers have seen a massive increase in wages, the median hasn't changed).\n\n\nsorry I'm knackered and rambling.\n\nI think the opening of the markets to competition, change in taxation and de-unionisation (fantastic move but not followed by necessary regulations to protect employees) were great ideas.

The US constitution guarantees free speech, free religion, protection against unreasonable searches, etc. It doesn't make sense that those guarantees only apply if the federal government is the actor. And thats what I thought the jurisprudence reflected. You really think the Court will go the route of allowing states to impose Islam on their citizens, of allowing states to suppress any and all speech they wish, etc, because they are states and thus not subject to the Bill of Rights? \n\nI'm sorry, but I just think its ridiculous to even consider the court reversing that the bill of rights applies to states. If you can consider that, why not consider reversing all other applications of the bill of rights to states. And think about the reality that such would create. It would be like there were no Bill of Rights, there could be no actual freedom. \n\nAnyway, you address only the establishment clause, and ignore the supremacy clause. May I remind you that NC would be \"asserting\" a constitutional interpretation, and therefore \"not recognize federal court rulings which prohibit [or] regulate... the State from making laws respecting an establishment of religion.\"\n\nFirst, the State asserts that it has some role in interpreting the Constitution. WTF?! Apparently nobody in the state legislature read Maurberry v Madison? No, bad legislature. You can't just *say* that your going to step outside your role and preform the SCOTUS's role. Take a break on this one, Supreme Court, the NC legislature has already done the work of interpreting the US Constitution for you. \n\nThe fact that they would even assert this is disgusting. They are basically saying, \"We have no idea how the Constitution or the law works, but fuck it we'll do what we want\"\n\nEven if they were right, they still lose on the supremacy clause. They essentially say, \"because we have interpreted the constitution as X, we reject any judicial order that prohibits us from creating laws inline with X\". They think they can just reinterpret the constitution on their own, and *then ignore federal orders directing them to obey the federal interpretation of the* **federal** *document*.\n\nTl;Dr: Read the preceding sentence, it sums up North Carolina's position", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1bnw6p", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c98wdnv", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1365142337", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "WhirledWorld", "id": "t1_c98pdw9", "parent_id": "t1_c98neci", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431669949, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "lawyer", "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c98pdw9", "author_flair_text": "[Lawyer][Conservative]", "created_utc": "1365120747", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Dennis_Langley", "id": "t1_c98neci", "parent_id": "t1_c98fbca", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431670887, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c98neci", "author_flair_text": "[PhD Candidate:Voting and Ideology][Liberal]", "created_utc": "1365115089", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "WhirledWorld", "id": "t1_c98fbca", "parent_id": "t3_1bnw6p", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431674708, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "lawyer", "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c98fbca", "author_flair_text": "[Lawyer][Conservative]", "created_utc": "1365094158", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}

It's corporate welfare.\n\nWe just witnessed an election in which billions of dollars were spent on various campaigns. Much of this money came from corporations and wealthy business people.

The parties to the case were U.S. Term Limits, a non-profit advocacy group, and the politician Ray Thornton, among others.\n\n\nHow are you a lawyer and not know about this case?", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8knrdk", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361684781", "distinguished": null, "ups": 3}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "WhirledWorld", "id": "t1_c8knkpu", "parent_id": "t1_c8kn9nc", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1431389040, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "lawyer", "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8knkpu", "author_flair_text": "[Lawyer][Conservative]", "created_utc": "1361684038", "distinguished": null, "ups": 3}

This would kill most benefits for employees. It's efficient because employees get a fatter paycheck, which they could spend on insurance or whatever they like. It's equitable because it bridges the gap between different employers and between the employed and the unemployed. And it's simple because it eliminates some byzantine rules on whether that donut you ate at Friday's meeting is income or not.\n\n2) **Eliminate the capital gains preferences.** It's equitable because capital gains are income just as much as non-capital gains. It's simple because the rules are very complex. It's efficient because there's little evidence that it affects people's behavior much, and the costs of compliance and figuring out the tax code are not worth supposed economic gains. Also, fun fact: Reagan eliminated the tax preference.\n\n3) **Eliminate the corporate tax.** It's inequitable because corporate employees and shareholders bear the burden of this tax, and there's really no reason that your salary should be lower because you work at a big company rather than a small company.

I'll note right off the bat that I am a strong Democrat and a \"moderate\" liberal (aka fiscally moderate and socially very liberal like all the other Gen-Yers). Apologies in advance for what may be a bit scatterbrained post. \n\nNow then, with regards to equity:  \nI think it's important to understand that there are two types of equity: vertical and horizontal. Vertical equity implies that if you make more, you pay more. How much more is a matter of great debate, but even with a \"flat\" tax system if you make more you're still paying more.\n\nHorizontal equity, meanwhile, implies that two people making the same amount of money pay the same in taxes. So that the doctor making $250,000 a year, the lawyer making $250,000 a year, and the investor making $250,000 a year all pay the same amount. Simple enough in theory.\n\nSo, looking at our system today, I think it's easy to say that it's not simple. It isn't particularly efficient either. And, it has some issues with vertical equity and MAJOR issues with horizontal equity. \n\nNow, with regards to your suggestions:\n1. The reason benefits are taxed is precisely because of equity. If two jobs both pay $100k, but Job 1 has a free company car, or a gym, or what-have-you, well then they really aren't equal. So we try and account for that. And, taking things to the extreme, a job that pays $15,000 but provides the employee with a 3000 sq ft house, company car, company gym, 3 meals a day, etc. isn't really a $15,000 job. \n2. I agree wholeheartedly with #2, and will admit I'm surprised to hear a conservative say it. I'm gonna expand on this below.\n3. My view is that since corporations are legal entities in this countries, with special privileges, then by all means they should be taxed. That said, I agree wholeheartedly that our corporate tax rate is too high. I would note, however, that there is a significant difference between nominal and effective tax rates, and that in reality many companies are by no means actually paying 35%. I am therefore in agreement with those (including the President) in favor of reducing rates while removing loopholes and deductions, etc. I'm pretty sure in principle that conservaties agree with this idea in principle, so hopefully there's a break in partisanship and something gets done. Whether the change is revenue-neutral or revenue positive is a different discussion, as is the final nominal rate, but still, this should be much easier to find common ground on than a lot of things. \n\n\nNow, as to my ideas:\n\nThis may not be popular, but one way to achieve the three goals of a tax system mentioned earlier is to replace our income tax system with a wealth tax. This does a few things:\n1. It solves the equity problem. A properly designed wealth tax system is both vertically and horizontally equitable. \n2. It's pretty damn simple. You have wealth, we tax it. It doesn't matter what form it's in (whether liquid assets, or property, or cars, whatever).\n3. It's efficient. It doesn't discourage consumption like a sales tax might, nor does it discourage investment like some argue raising the cap gains tax would. You could argue it discourages success, but I don't see how it would do so any more than the income tax. It doesn't result in the shifting of preferences (that can end up harming \"poor\" workers) that luxury taxes on specific goods do. \n\nIt does have a few problems. One is that it can be tricky to properly value wealth. One need only to look at the constant upward trend in property appraisals to know that the government and the market don't always agree. Not to mention trying to calculate the wealth of someone that has converted all of their money into 20,000 hairdryers. On this same subject there will be some method of tax avoidance, just as there is for virtually every tax system. Another is that even after retiring you would still be taxed, you would have actively negative income. There would also have to be considerations for the poor. They still have assets, but arguably should not be taxed (but welfare/means testing/etc. is a whole different discussion that I will not get into for now). \n\nOf course, there is little chance that such a tax would ever be enacted, so it's just random musing on my part. I think that changing our cap gains and corporate tax laws are a good start, and in general agree that we should simplify our tax code. I would likely sign on to the simpson-bowles proposal for taxes, provided I could be convinced that such a tax system would be suitably progressive enough and that those at the top wouldn't weasel a way out of paying the \"fair share.\"", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18bl3q", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8dpmvy", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1360648753", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t3_18bl3q", "score": 13, "retrieved_on": 1431262671, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "lawyer", "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18bl3q", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8dfb4c", "author_flair_text": "[Lawyer][Conservative]", "created_utc": "1360615528", "ups": 13, "distinguished": null}

It is often not that they \"can't\" hire as many owrkers at that price, it is that they \"won't\". And sometimes the \"won't\" is \"won't because the CEO needs a new parachute worth another million.\" \n\nThis idea that workers should sacrifice their level of pay until the employer is happy is what causes the race to the bottom we are presently experiencing in America. In fact there is an article up in r/politics about who the new norm for Americans is low wage and temporary jobs with no benefits and no future. Unions are a bulwark against that kind of thing. Notice the increase of these kids of jobs throughout the American economy at the same time as union rolls have been on a gradual decline.\n\nLastly, the situation you imagine only applies to certain jobs. There are many jobs for which the number of employees needed is static. Within a narrow range you either have enough people to do the job or you don't and once you do you need no more. So if building a car requires 10 people (as a made up example) then no matter how cheaply those people offer to work you're not going to hire guy 11. He would have nothing to do.

And higher wages for the middle class spur more production as those workers take their higher wages and go out and spend the money, thereby increasing the pay or number of jobs for other workers in the economy. Whereas the CEO often spends a lower percentage of his income than the middle or lower class employees and occasionally takes his pay out of the economy completely by taking it off-shore. Therefore, given a fixed amount of money, you're better off having lower CEO pay and higher worker pay if you want to spur production in the economy.

It is often not that they \"can't\" hire as many owrkers at that price, it is that they \"won't\". And sometimes the \"won't\" is \"won't because the CEO needs a new parachute worth another million.\" \n\nThis idea that workers should sacrifice their level of pay until the employer is happy is what causes the race to the bottom we are presently experiencing in America. In fact there is an article up in r/politics about who the new norm for Americans is low wage and temporary jobs with no benefits and no future. Unions are a bulwark against that kind of thing. Notice the increase of these kids of jobs throughout the American economy at the same time as union rolls have been on a gradual decline.\n\nLastly, the situation you imagine only applies to certain jobs. There are many jobs for which the number of employees needed is static. Within a narrow range you either have enough people to do the job or you don't and once you do you need no more. So if building a car requires 10 people (as a made up example) then no matter how cheaply those people offer to work you're not going to hire guy 11. He would have nothing to do. So in cases like those, lowering wages only increases CEO/shareholder pay.

When demand for your services is high you will hire more people even if the cost of workers has risen slightly. It is almost always better to pay more for workers than it is to leave an order unfulfilled. \n\n&gt;Higher wages aren't an inherent good. Higher production is, and higher wages flow from higher production. \n\nRight. And higher wages for the middle class spur more production as those workers take their higher wages and go out and spend the money, thereby increasing the pay or number of jobs for other workers in the economy. Whereas the CEO often spends a lower percentage of his income than the middle or lower class employees and occasionally takes his pay out of the economy completely by taking it off-shore. Therefore, given a fixed amount of money, you're better off having lower CEO pay and higher worker pay if you want to spur production in the economy. Workers will go out and spend it, CEOs will put it in the bank or in China. \n\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_17gu1c", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c85qnok", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1359484227", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c85nnb1", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431119955, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "lawyer", "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c85qgmg", "author_flair_text": "[Lawyer][Conservative]", "created_utc": "1359483667", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c85nezt", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431118607, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;The same analysis to the labor market--there are some folks who would be happy to hire folks at a lower wage, but now that the UAW dictates a higher wage, they can't hire as many folks.\n\nA few things. \n\nLet us be precise. It is often not that they \"can't\" hire as many owrkers at that price, it is that they \"won't\". And sometimes the \"won't\" is \"won't because the CEO needs a new parachute worth another million.\" \n\nThis idea that workers should sacrifice their level of pay until the employer is happy is what causes the race to the bottom we are presently experiencing in America. In fact there is an article up in r/politics about who the new norm for Americans is low wage and temporary jobs with no benefits and no future. Unions are a bulwark against that kind of thing. Notice the increase of these kids of jobs throughout the American economy at the same time as union rolls have been on a gradual decline.\n\nLastly, the situation you imagine only applies to certain jobs. There are many jobs for which the number of employees needed is static. Within a narrow range you either have enough people to do the job or you don't and once you do you need no more. So if building a car requires 10 people (as a made up example) then no matter how cheaply those people offer to work you're not going to hire guy 11. He would have nothing to do. So in cases like those, lowering wages only increases CEO/shareholder pay.

Instead of an hourly wage, this system directly exposed miners to the price of coal, and they realized that by threatening the coal supply (by not mining it) they could raise the market price and the price the mine operator would pay for it.

It is often not that they \"can't\" hire as many owrkers at that price, it is that they \"won't\". And sometimes the \"won't\" is \"won't because the CEO needs a new parachute worth another million.\" \n\nThis idea that workers should sacrifice their level of pay until the employer is happy is what causes the race to the bottom we are presently experiencing in America. In fact there is an article up in r/politics about who the new norm for Americans is low wage and temporary jobs with no benefits and no future. Unions are a bulwark against that kind of thing. Notice the increase of these kids of jobs throughout the American economy at the same time as union rolls have been on a gradual decline.\n\nLastly, the situation you imagine only applies to certain jobs. There are many jobs for which the number of employees needed is static. Within a narrow range you either have enough people to do the job or you don't and once you do you need no more. So if building a car requires 10 people (as a made up example) then no matter how cheaply those people offer to work you're not going to hire guy 11. He would have nothing to do.

HUMAN!\", but that doesn't mean I am not capable of distinguishing the difference between a third trimester fetus and a zygote.  What upsets me is when conservative Christians claim to know when human rights begin.  It seems to me to be a claim of knowing something that can't possibly be known at this time.\n\nI'm settled in favor of abortion rights though, because I'm convinced that even if a fetus is a person from day 1, it is not the government's place to instruct one person to forcefully provide life support for another person.  So, to me, figuring out whether or not a fetus is a person or not is irrelevant to the question.  Once the fetus is viable to live outside of the womb, then I think it would be an infringement on that unborn baby's rights to terminate it's life when it could simply be removed from it's mother's life support.

The FEC**. *Citizens* didn't change anything about the FEC (Federal Election Commission), which is the agency responsible for regulating campaign finance. If you're worried about \"corrupting influence\" or people not knowing where the speech is coming from, good news! This entire agency has broad rulemaking powers that requires campaign speech to have things like \"Obama for America is responsible for the content of this ad\" and disclosures about who funds Obama for America.\n\n**2. The decision itself.** *Citizens* did not touch the prohibition on corporate spending on campaigns (i.e. business still can't do that). They can't donate to political parties. All they *can* do is talk about the issues, really. For example, Exxon Mobil can't endorse Mitt Romney or use corporate funds to donate to him or his campaign. What they *can* do is use corporate funds to talk about what oil is cheaper and better than really expensive clean energy.\n\n**3. The very structure of corporations makes it almost impossible to invest in political speech.** Corporations are controlled by shareholders, and shareholders only care about one thing: profit. Spending money on political speech is an incredibly stupid thing for almost every corporation to do, because it's very hard to make a profit through political speech.

As the ultimate goal is profits for owners of what makes up the economy, anything that may hinder this is considered negative, even at the expense of what may seem like rational and moral ( feeding babies, paying someone enough to live) . Think of the bootstrap statements you and I have heard from our entire lives. Yes some people get great ideas and become rich. But more often you stay in the same class you were born in and though you worked your ass off your entire life you don't have much of anything to call your own that would be considered economically valuable.  Unions thus, are negative to a capitalist society because they collectively bargain to reduce one man's ( and his company's share holders) rate of profit by requiring him to ensure safety equipment, pay for accidents caused by working conditions, pay a living wage, give time off for silly things like babies etc.  Unions in our country stem from over 100 years ago when children were working in factories for entire days for little pay and often high chances of serious injury. The goal was to curb the level of exploitation ( BIG NO NO to a perfect capitalist economy) . More recently there has been an increase in the negative stereotypes surounding unions due to some of that capitalistic culture being practiced within admin groups for unions ( embezzlement of union funds, backdoor deals with the company they should be \"fighting\" for better conditions/pay etc) this has worked in business's favor the last few decades as union participation is at all time lows in the US where in other European countries they have 3-5 times the rate of participation.  This is a very simple explanation.

First, whether the Grutter test is still valid. The Texas model was designed explicitly to mirror what the Supreme Court said was acceptable there. If they rule that that isn't ok, then they're going to force a whole lot of universities to redesign their policy.\n\nSecond, whether this is the least burdensome means of increasing diversity. The Texas case is unique because they don't just have the race-conscious affirmative action program, but also the 10% rule: if you're in the top 10% of your high school class, you get in automatically. This program has gone a long way toward increasing diversity, so Fisher is obviously arguing that this is a facially neutral law that works *better* than the race-based one that they also have now.\n\nThe third issue is the \"sunset clause\" and whether Texas has achieved \"enough\" diversity, which is hard to put a finger on. I think Michigan's goal was 15% minority enrollment; Texas is already above that. But, I find that to be a disingenuous argument because Texas as a state is way more diverse than Michigan. So the question is whether 15% would apply for all states, or if it should be based off of that state's demographics. In the Grutter decision, they say that the day would come when affirmative action is no longer needed, but they don't specify when that would be. So Fisher will argue that Texas has reached that point. \n\nIn my opinion, the court will rule against Texas but only on the grounds that they have another better means of increasing diversity while not explicitly choosing based on race.
