The fact that ocean heat content studies have supported and continue to support the AGW theory mostly just goes to show how many different lines of evidence are involved. Studies of ocean heat content have been ongoing for decades, so it's not like there was some mad scramble to find the \"missing\" heat. Scientists knew where it was going all along. What they can't do (so far) is predict ENSO cycles 10, 20, or 30 years in advance.

If a company wants to enjoy all the benefits of being based in America then our labor laws should apply to wherever they employ people. It is morally irresponsible to say that slave labor is illegal for our own citizens but just fine for everyone else. This would bring manufacturing jobs and all other oft outsourced work back to America OR it could possibly cause a lot of businesses to flee America and make their base of operations elsewhere. If the latter were the case I think they would find that success is not as easy without the generous support of the American government and the huge market of the American people and ultimately they would choose to return or fail (of course some would still succeed, possibly a fair number, but that would cause similar labor revolutions in those countries as America in the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries).\n\nTo preserve the market of America we would also have to begin taxing imported goods a sufficient rate to discourage the kind of flight of business that I just mentioned. Why would we want them to prosper enormously on the backs of slaves and then charge a huge mark-up in the states for those products? We need to generate our own economy to a certain degree and if we are the ones buying the stuff we should try and make us the ones that are making those things or have a sort of equitable trade of exports with other countries that is mutually beneficial. Again, if we believe that C and Y has to be the law in America then we should not be allowing trade with business that ignores these rules, it is a pretty clear-cut moral imperative. \n\nNest, in a similar vein, we have to begin fining companies for their misconduct at a sufficient rate so that it is not financially possible for them to break the rules, pay the fine, still make a shitload of profit, and pass on all the costs of their blunder to the taxpayers. This would be for things like pollution and whatnot. As it stands the fines for massive toxic dumpings and other similar egregious errors of judgement are a pittance in compared to what it would actually cost to dispose of this waste responsibly and effectively, this cost is then passed on to the taxpayers when the government has to clean it up or onto the people as China is seeing with their unbreathable air and undrinkable water.\n\nThis same policy also would have prevented the current banking scandal in which we simply bailed out the banks rather than, as a an option in the bailout bill allowed for and what the US has forced other countries to do when we have intervened in their banking scandals, to have the government take over the banks and run them until they are profitable again at which point the shares would be sold off back to private investors and the taxpayers would get a small and reasonable return on their investment that would act as interest on the bailout loan. \n\nThis also means simply no more of these bullshit tax loopholes. I can't understand how anyone is not outraged by this. In tons of cases the government and taxpayers are literally paying huge corporations for the privilege of being fucked by them. If you run a business, if you earn money, and use public services then you pay taxes to support that system. It is literally that simple. Some of these loopholes are simply legalese bullshit and others are there for a reason and we know why they are there and how they are supposed to be used. If a giant corporations bookkeepers can find and exploit these loopholes the government should also be able to find them and close them up or deny the flagrant use of them for other than their intended design.\n\nFinally (not necessarily the last thing but I don't know how much more I can actually type with becoming exhausted or aggravated right now) we actually need to begin investing in the people of this country again. This means putting a focus on free, equitable, and quality education all the way through college. The more educated and skilled our populace the healthier the economy on the whole is. This would also mean better public services, chiefly of which would be universal healthcare [(I just went on a tear about this in another thread)](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/18uua0/americans_of_reddit_if_sacrificing_your_defense/c8i6t5t?context=3) which would serve to lessen personal debt among our citizens, encourage a healthier population, and overall cost the government a great deal less.\n\nOther 'entitlement' programs (the quotes are derisive, these are programs meant to help those who need help. Of course they will be abused but it is our duty to help those who need it and that means a few bad eggs are going to bilk the system - though that money would be a pittance in comparison to what giant corporations bilk from us currently) need to be re-imagined, retooled, made more effective and comprehensive, and all around better. Though that is a whole other discussion about how to make that happen.\n\nI probably just came off as a blow-hard, narcissist, know-it-all but I ruminate on these issues quite often and will take any opportunity I have to try and explicate them and tout the good that could come of actually realizing the real American Dream where everyone actually does have the ability to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and make a better life for themselves and their families. Every man, woman, and child should be ashamed at the state of moral repugnance this country has gotten to thanks to the fake design of 'capitalism' and 'free-market' that conservatives have created over the past 100 years. Yes, what I am talking about is not an absolutely free market, it is a controlled free market and this is the only way to actually create an equitable system and more importantly the only way to scrupulously run a country. A truly free market is every third-world country in the world where drug kingpins, warlords, and tyrants rule at the cost of the health, happiness, and lives of the people they are exploiting. That is free-market and I will not stand for the kind of freedom that allows children to starve and women to be raped for the greed of despicable human beings.      \n\nSorry about the rant, I am sure I said way more than you wish to read.

Granted, if they were ignored, then any data pertaining to detaining and arresting illegal aliens would be wrong, right?\n\neither of our anecdotal experiences are meaningless in this conversation. if you have other data sets for me to look at, i will be happy to do so, but all available data shows the overwhelming majority of illegal infiltrators into this country are coming from central and south america and are primarily mestizo/amerindian ethnicity. the exact entry method is meaningful only inasmuch as discussing ways to stop it, which we are not.\n\n&gt;why would black people be arrested more than other groups [for drug violations]? \n\nthey tend to do drugs in more public places and be around other activity/people that attract police attention, such as areas with high rates of violent crime. there also exist cultural differences where a white is more likely to immediately comply with police while black culture contains a heavy dose of anti-authoritariansm which leads to behavior when interacting with police that attract even further attention.\n\nthese are **GROSS** generalizations, but they explain much of the gap on victimless drug arrests.\n\nwhat's more useful is to correlate victimization data (for things like assault, robbery, violent rape) with arrest and conviction rates, which show less proportional arrests and convictions for blacks than their proportion of victims would suggest. i would attribute this more towards the 'don't snitch' culture and overwhelmed urban police forces, but i don't have any way to back that up with hard data.\n\n&gt;such margins could not be racism, right?\n\nthey could be if they didn't match victimization data. if say, asians were getting arrested and convicted at higher rates than whites, despite having lower rates of criminality by all measures, then racism would be an acceptable hypothesis to dig into. **there is no logical, fact based argument that higher rates of black incarceration are primarily due to racism specifically against them as opposed to higher rates of criminality.** simply pointing out differences in per capita imprisonment do not constitute an argument for this as i outlined above.\n\n&gt;if a racist legal system targets black people, then they were right because they detain more black people.\n\na logical, fair, and just system will target people who are committing crimes more heavily than those who are not. any argument that there is racism inherent with our justice system or republicans' stance on illegal colonization/immigration needs to first establish that these groups do not commit more crimes or illegally enter first.\n\nsimple disparities are not evidence of any kind of racism or discrimination. is there racism keeping asians from competing in the NFL in proportion to their share of the population? what about racism keeping jews out of the NBA in proportion to their share of the population? \n\nquick aside: there does seem to be a disparity based on the facts i have seen between sentence length when comparing whites and asians to blacks when controlling for crime committed, prior record, etc. my best guess is that this is due to the other groups being more likely to be able to afford decent lawyers than having to rely more on public defendants. 'racism' could be a possible explanation, but doesn't really have any evidence specifically supporting it that i am aware of.\n\n&gt;I was wrong on Rome and Greece, I'm sorry, I was tired and not thinking when I wrote that.\n\nit happens, no sweat. i respect anyone who can own up to an honest mistake versus pointlessly arguing the issue.\n\n&gt;You have no faith and are looking at early election results.

Granted, if they were ignored, then any data pertaining to detaining and arresting illegal aliens would be wrong, right?\n\neither of our anecdotal experiences are meaningless in this conversation. if you have other data sets for me to look at, i will be happy to do so, but all available data shows the overwhelming majority of illegal infiltrators into this country are coming from central and south america and are primarily mestizo/amerindian ethnicity. the exact entry method is meaningful only inasmuch as discussing ways to stop it, which we are not.\n\n&gt;why would black people be arrested more than other groups [for drug violations]? \n\nthey tend to do drugs in more public places and be around other activity/people that attract police attention, such as areas with high rates of violent crime. there also exist cultural differences where a white is more likely to immediately comply with police while black culture contains a heavy dose of anti-authoritariansm which leads to behavior when interacting with police that attract even further attention.\n\nthese are **GROSS** generalizations, but they explain much of the gap on victimless drug arrests.\n\nwhat's more useful is to correlate victimization data (for things like assault, robbery, violent rape) with arrest and conviction rates, which show less proportional arrests and convictions for blacks than their proportion of victims would suggest. i would attribute this more towards the 'don't snitch' culture and overwhelmed urban police forces, but i don't have any way to back that up with hard data.\n\n&gt;such margins could not be racism, right?\n\nthey could be if they didn't match victimization data. if say, asians were getting arrested and convicted at higher rates than whites, despite having lower rates of criminality by all measures, then racism would be an acceptable hypothesis to dig into. **there is no logical, fact based argument that higher rates of black incarceration are primarily due to racism specifically against them as opposed to higher rates of criminality.** simply pointing out differences in per capita imprisonment do not constitute an argument for this as i outlined above.\n\n&gt;if a racist legal system targets black people, then they were right because they detain more black people.\n\na logical, fair, and just system will target people who are committing crimes more heavily than those who are not. any argument that there is racism inherent with our justice system or republicans' stance on illegal colonization/immigration needs to first establish that these groups do not commit more crimes or illegally enter first.\n\nsimple disparities are not evidence of any kind of racism or discrimination. is there racism keeping asians from competing in the NFL in proportion to their share of the population? what about racism keeping jews out of the NBA in proportion to their share of the population? \n\nquick aside: there does seem to be a disparity based on the facts i have seen between sentence length when comparing whites and asians to blacks when controlling for crime committed, prior record, etc. my best guess is that this is due to the other groups being more likely to be able to afford decent lawyers than having to rely more on public defendants.

I should define Valid vs. Invalid. A Valid argument is one that has some grounding in fact or science. Saying that the Republicans left a mess and seem unwilling to allow Democrats like Joe Biden clean up the mess is actually a valid sentiment, and would require proof to dismiss.

Granted, if they were ignored, then any data pertaining to detaining and arresting illegal aliens would be wrong, right?\n\neither of our anecdotal experiences are meaningless in this conversation. if you have other data sets for me to look at, i will be happy to do so, but all available data shows the overwhelming majority of illegal infiltrators into this country are coming from central and south america and are primarily mestizo/amerindian ethnicity. the exact entry method is meaningful only inasmuch as discussing ways to stop it, which we are not.\n\n&gt;why would black people be arrested more than other groups [for drug violations]? \n\nthey tend to do drugs in more public places and be around other activity/people that attract police attention, such as areas with high rates of violent crime. there also exist cultural differences where a white is more likely to immediately comply with police while black culture contains a heavy dose of anti-authoritariansm which leads to behavior when interacting with police that attract even further attention.\n\nthese are **GROSS** generalizations, but they explain much of the gap on victimless drug arrests.\n\nwhat's more useful is to correlate victimization data (for things like assault, robbery, violent rape) with arrest and conviction rates, which show less proportional arrests and convictions for blacks than their proportion of victims would suggest. i would attribute this more towards the 'don't snitch' culture and overwhelmed urban police forces, but i don't have any way to back that up with hard data.\n\n&gt;such margins could not be racism, right?\n\nthey could be if they didn't match victimization data. if say, asians were getting arrested and convicted at higher rates than whites, despite having lower rates of criminality by all measures, then racism would be an acceptable hypothesis to dig into. **there is no logical, fact based argument that higher rates of black incarceration are primarily due to racism specifically against them as opposed to higher rates of criminality.** simply pointing out differences in per capita imprisonment do not constitute an argument for this as i outlined above.\n\n&gt;if a racist legal system targets black people, then they were right because they detain more black people.\n\na logical, fair, and just system will target people who are committing crimes more heavily than those who are not. any argument that there is racism inherent with our justice system or republicans' stance on illegal colonization/immigration needs to first establish that these groups do not commit more crimes or illegally enter first.\n\nsimple disparities are not evidence of any kind of racism or discrimination. is there racism keeping asians from competing in the NFL in proportion to their share of the population? what about racism keeping jews out of the NBA in proportion to their share of the population? \n\nquick aside: there does seem to be a disparity based on the facts i have seen between sentence length when comparing whites and asians to blacks when controlling for crime committed, prior record, etc. my best guess is that this is due to the other groups being more likely to be able to afford decent lawyers than having to rely more on public defendants.

In situations where no party can get away with voter intimidation, the power will fluctuate between two vaguely moderate positions, occasionally rocked by some world event or another. WWII tipped us left, so in the 50s, we rocked right, so the sixties we rocked left, and kinda stabilized in the 70's until Regan nudged us right, then in the 90's we went left, and stabilized in 2000 until we were pushed hard right by an attack, and only swayed left 5 years later. I really don't think we're actually nearly as extreme as a few of those periods, and I think we'll try another right approach, (maybe in 2020?) before the political stagnation, and we'll need something to rock the boat again.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_18jgsg", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8gy92r", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361151457", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c8gp7rd", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431320624, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8gqr9t", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1361124442", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "reginaidiotarum", "id": "t1_c8gp7rd", "parent_id": "t1_c8gewl3", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1435583161, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hey, I'm saying that I'm on the complete opposite side of the country from the Mexican Boarder, and we still have a lot of illegal immigrants. They are coming by boat, but are completely ignored because the Mexican border is the place where illegal immigrants are coming from, right? Granted, if they were ignored, then any data pertaining to detaining and arresting illegal aliens would be wrong, right?\n\nLike, if we had drug laws in place, and pretty much any ethnicity would be into these drugs, then why would black people be arrested more than other groups? Are you saying white people don't do illegal drugs? How does 13.6% of the population account for 39.4% of the prison population? But such margins could not be racism, right?\n\nSo, to recap, I presented that the GOP's obsession with one border is seen as racist because, through their focus, the have become blind to all other threats, showing that they don't actually care about illegal aliens at all, and your response is to assert that they were right because more illegal aliens were found where they were looking. I presented the fallacy in this argument by presenting another scenario of a clearly focused and deliberate attack, and you say they are right, because look at the results; if a racist legal system targets black people, then they were right because they detain more black people.\n\nI was wrong on Rome and Greece, I'm sorry, I was tired and not thinking when I wrote that.\n\nYou have no faith and are looking at early election results.

The biggest carry-over from Clinton era to Bush era is that Clinton did not capture Bin Laden when he claims he wanted to. The ecomony only started to go to shit at the end of his second term, and by that point it was easy to point to his wars as being a problem. Did Bush deserve the hatred he got? I think that the GOP's abandonment of him at least acknowledges that people hate him.\n\nAs far as the last point you make, you say historically things devolve from the inside of a democracy?

Illegal Immigration is a problem, but Mexican are hardly the only group coming over illegally. It comes off as a directed attack, and nothing loses an ethnic group like directly attacking them. On top of that, because Mexico is held as the big source of illegal immigrants, it's that much harder for legal Mexican immigrants to be taken seriously or given the same respect as, let's say a Russian immigrant.\n\nAnd it's sad, but with a few changes in words, and playing the game properly, they could have their cake and eat it too. If the GOP were to come up with better Immigration Law that had a more broad stroke, they could totally bank off the largely Christian immigrants.\n\nOkay, maybe I was a bit unfair with my second point, but I'm really giving my opinion as to why I think that more attention is given to Republican gaffs over Democrat ones. I should define Valid vs. Invalid. A Valid argument is one that has some grounding in fact or science. Saying that the Republicans left a mess and seem unwilling to allow Democrats like Joe Biden clean up the mess is actually a valid sentiment, and would require proof to dismiss. Tipping the island of Guam is not founded in any sort of reality, there is already proof that Islands are physically incapable of tipping over, so we do not require proof to dismiss it.\n\nNow, Republicans have been getting have been catching flak recently because of birth control and abortion legislature that, from the start puts women on edge. Naval position doesn't get that much respect or awareness, sadly. The unfortunate thing about drawing attention to yourself in a controversial issue is that there are people out there looking for the slightest mess-up to tear you down.\n\nSo, when you say stuff like, \"Rape babies are god's gift,\" and \"If it's a illegitimate rape the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down\" You will be called out as incompetent.\n\nOh, both sides play the game. It's politics. I love watching it in action, but it's better on reality TV shows rather than on who controls what we we do. I understand that the mentality is currently to \"win\" at politics, I also understand that it is probably impossible to get rid of that mentality. I just feel that it's extremely unhealthy for everyone involved.\n\nAnd, I agree with you on that last point, the Two party system will lead to an overall moderate stance on issues. C. G. P. Grey has excellent video about how that works, and there have been many debates about whether or not this is a good thing. I'm just saying that a unified America is better than 50 different countries, and that there are more solutions that Two Party and completely dissolving the union.\n\nThe biggest question is do we want a Government that caters to everyone's wants or needs? A Representative government will not give everyone everything they want, but, since some people want to kill and steal from me, I'm actually pretty okay with that.

Boarder control being brought up all the time makes even the legal aliens feel like they are unwelcome.\n\nWith the ignorance, again, there are a great many quotes from Republican politicians that just show how out of touch they are. When looking for dumb Republican quotes versus dumb democrat quotes, democrats seem to be using improper phrasing to convey a valid point, where the dumb Republican quotes are just plain wrong.

Rather than having a political, or even an adult mentality brought onto the floor, looking for what is best for everyone involved, they treat lawmaking like a game, that you must win.

You consider that statistically insignificant enough to warrant keeping them available in case of your doomsday scenario, where pistols, rifles and shotguns aren't enough? \n\nyes. eventually people will see the pattern that these attacks are done against only unarmed people, and they will take responsibility for their own self defense instead of being deluded into thinking the police will be able to help you.\n\nyou have to demonstrate that the type of bans you are seeking would reduce the number and severity of these attacks before going down this line of reasoning anyways. the best data point we have is the previous AWB which did not alter the gradual decline in gun violence the country had been experiencing since the late 80's. there is no other country that i am aware of that has banned these weapons and seen a decrease in total crime or total homicide. the best data points for this are the UK and austrailia which banned almost ALL firearms and saw total crime and total homicide go up. \n\nthere are many other variables at work, but the weight of evidence is pretty solidly against you.\n\n&gt;It's not just the mass bloodshed these cause, but the terror they instill.\n\nfunny, that's the argument for letting the people have them to instill 'terror' into the gov. glad you are starting to agree!\n\n&gt;First of all, I wasn't aware all AR-15 owners subscribe to the same political party, or that it necessarily differed from my own.\n\nthey do not (i for one wish the GOP a swift demise). i am pointing out that your opposition is either emotional or born of a desire to disarm those you percieve as political opponents, not that they necessarily subscribe to a singular party. so are you just wanting to close your eyes and make the scary guns go away or are you seeking to remove the ability of people who think differently to defend themselves?\n\n&gt; Second, the Heller decision states that outlawing handguns is unconstitutional, so going after them is not possible without amending the constitution/an overturning of Heller.\n\nso you admit that given free reign you would seek to totally disarm the US public? that you are fine removing the best tool for self defense for women from larger, stronger males? why do you hate women being able to fight off rapists?\n\n&gt;the argument can be made, however, that rifles made with the specific purpose of killing as many as fast as possible &amp; magazines that help facilitate that could fall under the \"dangerous and unusual weapon\" category.\n\nall firearms are dangerous. the most common man portable weapons on earth cannot be reasonable defined as \"unusual\" no matter how much cognitive dissonance and rationalization you try to employ.

Totalitarian regimes function much more like cults than like democracy, however, its common for a society to maintain the trappings of democracy but make them impotent, and actually be ruled from within by a cult. \n\nThat is one of the most common patterns of totalitarianism, and Arendt goes into discussing it at length..giving examples.. For example, Germany maintained an entire show government that had no real power.... So did the Soviets (with their soviets)  This is a very unique and insightfult section of her book.. the middle chapters are especially valuable..\n\nI have had many friends who lived under communism and they describe a system where certain people were in reality the bosses of organizations, however they were not the official bosses.. But basically everything had to be approved by these \"political appointees\". \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_Reform_and_the_Psychology_of_Totalism\n\nBy Robert J Lifton. Lifton described criteria which define cult-like behaviors..The book was about the \"thought reform\" techniques of the PRC, but many Communist nations have variations on the theme.. But the characteristics show up again and again in cults of all kinds..\n\nIn the book, Lifton outlines the **\"Eight Criteria for Thought Reform\":** (what Americans called \"brainwashing\")\n\n**Milieu Control**. This involves the control of information and communication both within the environment and, ultimately, within the individual, resulting in a significant degree of isolation from society at large.\n\n**Mystical Manipulation**. The manipulation of experiences that appears spontaneous but is, in fact, planned and orchestrated by the group or its leaders in order to demonstrate divine authority, spiritual advancement, or some exceptional talent or insight that sets the leader and/or group apart from humanity, and that allows reinterpretation of historical events, scripture, and other experiences. Coincidences and happenstance oddities are interpreted as omens or prophecies.\n\n**Demand for Purity**. The world is viewed as black and white and the members are constantly exhorted to conform to the ideology of the group and strive for perfection. The induction of guilt and/or shame is a powerful control device used here.\n\n**Confession**. Sins, as defined by the group, are to be confessed either to a personal monitor or publicly to the group. There is no confidentiality; members' \"sins,\" \"attitudes,\" and \"faults\" are discussed and exploited by the leaders.\n\n**Sacred Science**. The group's doctrine or ideology is considered to be the ultimate Truth, beyond all questioning or dispute. Truth is not to be found outside the group. The leader, as the spokesperson for God or for all humanity, is likewise above criticism.\n\n**Loading the Language**. The group interprets or uses words and phrases in new ways so that often the outside world does not understand. This jargon consists of thought-terminating clich\u00e9s, which serve to alter members' thought processes to conform to the group's way of thinking.\n\n**Doctrine over person**. Members' personal experiences are subordinated to the sacred science and any contrary experiences must be denied or reinterpreted to fit the ideology of the group.\n\n**Dispensing of existence**. The group has the prerogative to decide who has the right to exist and who does not. This is usually not literal but means that those in the outside world are not saved, unenlightened, unconscious and they must be converted to the group's ideology. If they do not join the group or are critical of the group, then they must be rejected by the members. Thus, the outside world loses all credibility. In conjunction, should any member leave the group, he or she must be rejected also.[3]\n\n---\n\n**Thought-terminating clich\u00e9**\n\nThought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism popularized the term \"thought-terminating clich\u00e9\", which refers to a clich\u00e9 that is a commonly used phrase, sometimes passing as folk wisdom, used to quell cognitive dissonance. Though the clich\u00e9d phrase in and of itself may be valid in certain contexts, its application as a means of dismissing dissent or justifying fallacious logic is what makes it thought-terminating.\n\nLifton said:[4][5]\n\n*The language of the totalist environment is characterized by the thought-terminating clich\u00e9. The most far-reaching and complex of human problems are compressed into brief, highly reductive, definitive-sounding phrases, easily memorized and easily expressed. These become the start and finish of any ideological analysis.*\n\nIn George Orwell\u2019s novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, the fictional constructed language Newspeak is designed to reduce language entirely to a set of thought-terminating clich\u00e9s. \n\nAldous Huxley\u2019s Brave New World society uses thought-terminating clich\u00e9s in a more conventional manner, most notably in regard to the drug soma as well as modified versions of real-life platitudes, such as, \"A doctor a day keeps the jim-jams away\". \n\nHannah Arendt, in her 1963 book Eichmann in Jerusalem, describes Adolf Eichmann as an intelligent man using many of these thought-terminating clich\u00e9s to justify his actions and the role he played in the Holocaust. For her, these phrases are symptomatic of an absence of thought.\n\n---\n\nAnother characteristic of totalitarian regimes is a conscious effort to **dehumanize** or **scapegoat** groups for the failings of society..\n\nThis becomes a practice of sequential dehumanization and often, extermination directed against these perceived enemies of the state. (who often are illusory) These campaigns are used as thought terminating cliches..\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought-terminating_clich\u00e9\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehumanization\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoat\n\n", "id": "t1_c82ad1e", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_170027", "selftext": "&gt;None of the examples you gave were democracies or sprung out of democracies.. all were preceded by disorder and dysfunction.\n\nthis is just a well constructed \"No True Scotsman\" argument with interesting links (thanks!).\n\nI would argue that modern western democracies have similar, but more skillfully engineered, aspects as to what you outline above in every single point you raise.\n\ni.e. the \"show government\" consists of the parties deemed acceptable by those controlling mass media. even if the elected officials (anyone ever audit any of these major elections to ensure accuracy?) give the decisions, their vetting by a de facto oligarchy is a massive limit on choice of the citizens. \n\nthought-terminating cliches and shifting of language use abound in the modern west as well. overall i'd say you make a pretty good argument for the modern west being totalitarian than being qualitatively different than these previous regimes. if anything this should be more concerning given the greater skill in managing the show.", "id": "t1_c82almy", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "C-LAR", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c82ad1e", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431056659, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c82almy", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1358973306", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c8132z9", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431056547, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1358987018, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c82ad1e", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1358972652", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t3_170027", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431035678, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c8132z9", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1358808001", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}

There are complete schools of thought in International Relations that debate this very point. Realism for example sees the inherent structure of the anarchic international system as the source of conflict among nation-states. The states themselves are treated as \"black boxes\" and their inner workings are disregarded. While this may seem simplistic, realism points to various dynamics in the modern-day international system that could drive nations into warmaking. Such are, for example, disputes over existential issues for a certain state that have proven to be impossible to solve via diplomacy or other means, or states being threatened or afraid by other states and their military capabilities.\n\nEdit: Incidentally and interestingly, believing in the democratic peace theory could one actually lead...to more war.

I'll go off of memory, and then provide a couple of other similar studies to look at.\n\nIn general, the presence of nuclear weapons tend to *destabilize* global relations. The graph looks something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/6XGmA.png). With only one nuclear state, there is almost a guarantee of a nuclear war; nuclear hegemony allows the sole nuclear state to act unilaterally without the possibility of symmetric retaliation. For historical proof, one need only to look at WWII. The US was able to use nuclear weapons in the final throes of its Japanese assault because it had no fear of repercussion. Japan couldn't nuke them back, nor could any other actor retaliate.\n\nIn a two-nuclear state world, we see the possibility of nuclear war decrease significantly. While it's still a present threat, both states are unlikely to engage in nuclear war against each other, or non-nuclear states for fear of reprisal from the other nuclear state. \n\nIn a 1981 [paper](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/waltz1.htm) on the spread of nuclear weapons, Kenneth Waltz discusses the progression of warfare throughout the centuries. In the past, large conglomerations of kingdoms and nation-states would band together with largely homogenous forces (think: knights, archers, catapults, etc). It was possible to miscalculate your opponents, or even your own, military presence because you are forced to depend on the fealty of other kingdoms and nation-states. \n\nHowever, with the advent of nuclear weapons, and at the height of the cold war, Waltz notes that 90% of the Warsaw Pact's military spending was made by the USSR; 60% of NATO's military spending was by the US. No longer did the US or the USSR need to rely on allies to execute a war: they had a larger force than their respective allies *combined*. Waltz: \n&gt;\"In a bipolar world, uncertainty lessens and calculations are easier to make. The military might of both great powers makes quick and easy conquest impossible for either, and this is clearly seen. To respond rapidly to fine changes in the mili\u00adtary balance is at once less important and more easily done.\" Waltz goes on to describe military actions on a global scale in a bipolar world: \"In the great-power politics of a bipolar world, who is a danger to whom is never in doubt. **Moreover, with only two powers capa\u00adble of acting on a world scale, anything that happens anywhere is potentially of concern to both of them.**\" (emphasis added) \n\nHad the USSR possessed nuclear weapons contemporaneously with the US, would Truman have been as likely to bomb Hiroshima and Nagaski? What if Emperor Hirohito had access to nuclear weapons and the capability to retaliate against the US mainland?\n\nAs the number of nuclear states increase, the relative strengths of the newly nuclear states becomes more symmetrical to those that led the bipolar world. \n\n&gt;\"With three or more powers, flexibility of alliances keeps relations of friendship and enmity fluid and makes everyone's estimate of the present and future relation of forces uncertain. ... Because who is a danger to whom is often unclear, the incentive to regard all dis\u00adequilibrating changes with concern and res\u00adpond to them with whatever effort may be required is weakened. To respond rapidly to fine changes is at once more difficult, because of blurred responsibilities, and more impor\u00adtant, because states live on narrow margins. Interdependence of parties, diffusion of dan\u00adgers, confusion of responses: These are the characteristics of great-power politics in a multi polar world.\"\n\nWaltz argues in 1981 that the spread of nuclear weapons won't create a multipolar world because there isn't a third state that can compete globally with the USSR and the US. \"The bipolar sys\u00adtem has lasted more than three decades because no third state has developed capabilities comparable to those of the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States produces about a quarter of the world's goods, and the Soviet Union about half as much. **Unless Europe unites, the United States will remain economically well ahead of other states.**\" (emphasis added). \n\nWhile Waltz comes to different conclusions \u2013 in the end, he thinks that proliferation isn't a threat because no other nation-state can achieve the level of nuclear force held by the USSR or the US \u2013 I think his conclusions are too dependent on the long-term sustainability of his bipolar state. The USSR collapsed a decade after he published his article. The Council on Foreign Relations discusses the potential for \"[loose nukes](http://www.cfr.org/weapons-of-terrorism/loose-nukes/p9549)\" \u2013 in short: the USSR had 27,000 nuclear weapons at its collapse; while Russia assures the world that they weapons are stored in a \"safe and reliable\" place, \"the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has reported more than a hundred nuclear smuggling incidents since 1993, eighteen of which involved highly enriched uranium, the key ingredient in an atomic bomb and the most dangerous product on the nuclear black market.\"\n\nWaltz never had to consider the threat of \"non-state actors\" (ie terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda) because in the 80s, the majority of global entities were state actors (sure, we can talk about the IRA from the 20s to the 60s, but that's regional.)\n\nWhat you're mainly talking about though, is what's called \"deterrence theory\". \n\n&gt;Different conceptions of rational deterrence theory assume that nuclear\nweapons have a deterrent effect at most levels of conflict. According to\ngeneral deterrence theory, a state should normally be deterred from starting war against a nuclear adversary because there is a possibility for the defender to launch a nuclear attack if its vital interests are severely affected (Morgan 1983; Ruth and Russett 1993).\n\n[Here](http://people.reed.edu/~ahm/Courses/Reed-POL-422-2012-S1_NP/Syllabus/EReadings/06.2/06.2.Paul1995Nuclear.pdf) is an interesting article on the (lack of) relevance of deterrence theory in regional conflicts between nuclear and non-nuclear states. In short, it doesn't work that way. Between 1945 and 1995, \"a total of 10 significant wars have occurred between nuclearstates and nonnuclear adversaries, 5 of which had been initiated by non-nuclear states.\" The threat of nuclear reprisal doesn't work because of what's known as the \"nuclear taboo\". \n\n&gt;It centers on the prohibitionary norm of nuclear taboo that all nuclear states have thus far observed. The argument here is that one of the key calculations, albeit an important one, of the nonnuclear state springs from the taboo, which is an unwritten international prohibition since the Hiroshima and Nagasaki attacks that nuclear weapons should not be used, especially against nonnuclear states.\n\nMoving on to your other comment:\n\n&gt;[Fiscal and monetary union] will not be successful because the people of europe simply do not want it.\n\nI disagree. Germans want it. As a supranational identity, I think Europeans want it. After all, economically the EU is far better off than it was pre-Union. The problem is that national \u2013 or sometimes regional \u2013 identity has superseded supranational identity. \n\nTake for example your average Parisian. The running joke is that they consider themselves a Parisian first, then a Frenchmen, then kind of a European. That provincial attitude runs counter to the EU's goal of shared culture and continental unity. It's not solely a Parisian attitude though, Barcelona, the Basque country and \u2013 sorry to say \u2013 Great Britain all act the same way. Self over country over Union. \n\nThe founders of the EU took steps to overcome that regional attitude, but its dissolution has been slow. A similar situation happened in the United States after the revolutionary war. (US history isn't my forte, so this'll be brief) The newly independent colonies formed themselves into a [Confederation of States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation) without much supranational authority. The interstate conflict eventually became too great and the Articles were replaced with the Constitution that formed a more cohesive Federalism with a superseded authority in the federal government.\n\nDo I think the European Union is a precursor to the United States of Europe? Maybe, but probably not. My point is that the EU is forging into unknown territory as the first supranational authority; growing pains are inevitable, revisions *will* be made and not everyone will like it at first. But eventually, I think a good system could come from sacrificing autonomy to a supranational authority.\n\nThe collective gains created by Union are too good to give up. Greece won't/can't leave, neither can Italy or Spain. But the current system is untenable, as we can clearly see. *Something* has to change. The **best** answer, in my opinion, is fiscal and monetary union \u2013 but that's my global political economy and finance background talking.", "id": "t1_c7xe76g", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Mitch_Deadberg", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "excellent reply, thank you for the links. \n\nfrom the nuke paper: \n&gt;Indeed, the fear of nuclear weapons is more manifest among their possessors, indicating the operation of self-deterrence.\n\nvery, very interesting paper. i think the reluctance to initiate nuclear defense options needs to be explored more, but i am not sure we can totally discount it (as the data from the paper seems to indicate) because the overwhelming strength of the bipolar or unipolar dominated world political environment might not always be there forever. fear of backlash from the super powers probably plays a large part in having second and third tier nuclear powers holding their fire.\n\n&gt;I disagree.

I also expect both of those to fall in line and enthusiastically endorse Christie.\n\ni actually would predict exactly this.\n\ni disagree pretty strongly with your prediction that christie will be able to assume the mantle of fiscal responsibility. he has faced down people in his own state convincingly (mostly aided by a balanced budget amendment that allows him to cut funding at will), but he doesn't have the reputation as a strict small government guy that someone like ron paul had (a precondition to getting that faction's support) and has many social policy positions at odds with the socially conservative part of the base (though he could neutralize this by taking a states rights type approach).\n\n i think a big part of the reason people like christie so much is that all they see of him on the national stage is fighting the unions, and then they project their own views onto him for everything else.\n\ndemographics are going to continue to work their inevitable path out and doom the GOP. i don't see christie generating so much more enthusiasm given the handicaps he already has with factions within the GOP to overcome four more years of demographic replacement of the GOP base.", "id": "t1_c7ubl7e", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "C-LAR", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_c7ubbwg", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430913992, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_168xeb", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7ubl7e", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357801188", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c7uahm7", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1430913883, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_168xeb", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7ubbwg", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357799994", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c7u9mx7", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430913460, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_168xeb", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7uahm7", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357796660", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_c7tsuah", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430912971, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_168xeb", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7u9mx7", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357793663", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t3_168xeb", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1430904913, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7tsuah", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357740271", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

Any discussion about pulling out of major debates at the federal level is just taking time away from discussing actual solutions to the perceived dysfunction of the current congress (such as the virtual impossibility of a Democrat lead house in 2014 due to a disgusting amount of gerrymandering by the Republican party - or campaign finance reform as a serious discussion - or any number of other, far more relevant discussions).
