What problem are you trying to solve with this amendment?\n\nThe fact that the State governments are cut almost entirely out of the federal power-structure and that as a result, we have the twin hydras of too much centralization of power in Washington and of too little political expertise going into the selection of representatives in Congress. It's easy to bamboozle a lowly voter, more difficult to do so with a politician who knows your games and has better access to information and more time on his hands to pay attention to what you're doing.

In some states, the governor appoints replacements while in others there are interim elections. Also, it is necessary to stipulate that the federal government shall not interfere in this process, unless we want federal laws standardizing (and possibly meddling with) the replacement process. \n\n&gt;You don't spell out what happens if a mayor or lieutenant governor is appointed.\n\nBecause they can't be. Only legislature electees are eligible for nomination.\n\n&gt;Why would we want the federal constitution to dictate any state constitutional process anyway?\n\nA fair question. My intention is to have the People retain some measure of control over who represents their State in the Senate, by stipulating that nominees for the Senate must come from a body of people \"pre-approved\" in a sense, by the people. This is so that wealthy businessmen or lobbyists don't end up in the Senate by pulling strings.\n\n&gt;This provision essentially ensures that senators no longer have independent terms.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1s9r7w", "selftext": "It might, but I suspect not in the way you're thinking. \n\nThe fiscal hit to the federal government would be non-existent. This is for two reasons. First, taxes are mostly paid by your employer. At the end of the year you might net up a little after filling on April 15, but most of the money has already been taken out of your pay check before you even get it. So, there's really no way for most people to withhold taxes from the government. Second, the government doesn't really *need* your money. The government (a term I use in this context to describe collectively the Treasury and the Federal Reserve) *issues* the dollar (and thus can never truly run out unless a self-imposed constraint like the debt ceiling applies) and the dollar has value because the issuer agrees to accept it as payment in taxes. So, you can't really starve the government directly through a taxation strike.\n\nThe flip side of this is that the dollar's value comes from its ability to extinguish tax liabilities. If, enough people all refused to pay taxes together -- so many that the government couldn't arrest them all -- then you would effectively have a popular vote of no confidence in the government. If the government is truly unable to collect taxes, then it has really lost its ability to govern as a sovereign. This would almost certainly result in a dollar crash and a collapse of the United States Government as it would no longer be able to pay the army, police, etc. and the government's legitimacy has been popularly repudiated, that is, a revolution. \n\nHow many people would have to want to bring down the U.S. for the trick to work is hard to say. What we're talking about is where the rubber meets the road on consent of the governed, and this hypothetical is really a question of how many people need to no longer consent before the government falls.

With the 2014 elections, Obama simply doesn't have the political capability to act hawkish. The Democrat's ability to hold the senate is jeopordized if Obama offends the Democrat's hippie base and they lose voter turnout. There are five retiring Democratic encumbants, and more significantly, according to Nathan Silver's blog, there is one senatorial seat that will definitely be lost to the GOP (WV), three tossup races for the Dem's to lose (LA, NC, and SD), and three uncomfortable races that the Democrats could still lose (AL, AK, IO). If the Democrats lose five seats, they lose the senate. If Obama infuriates the base, they may lose the presidency in 2016 (at least Hillary jetisoned herself early). The house isn't looking great for the Democrats, either. So Obama's political situation does not lend itself to strong foreign policy right now.\n\n**Secondly** - Obama has dramatically lowered his rhetoric against Syrian chemical weapons ever since his first statment. Obama once claimed that the [mobilization of chemical weapons would call \"cross a red line,\"](http://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/20/world/meast/syria-unrest) which he then reduced to [any military use of chemical weapons](http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/obama-warns-syria-again-chemical-weapons/) after intelligence placed chemical weapons in the field under Asssad.
