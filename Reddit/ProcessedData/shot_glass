For the south, it was completely and totally about slavery.  Slavery was the most contentious issue in American politics in the years leading up to the war.  When a new political party dedicated to the abolition of slavery (The Republican Party) came to power, the southern states realized they had lost the argument and resorted to secession.  \n\nBut don't take my word for it.  A number of the southern states **explicitly** cited slavery as the reason for their seceding in their Articles of Secession.  Take Georgia, for example:\n\n\"The people of Georgia having dissolved their political connection with the Government of the United States of America, present to their confederates and the world the causes which have led to the separation. **For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slave-holding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery. They have** endeavored to weaken our security, to disturb our domestic peace and tranquility, and **persistently refused to comply with their express constitutional obligations to us in reference to that property**[.]\"[link](http://sunsite.utk.edu/civil-war/reasons.html)\n\nFor the north, the choice was then about preserving the union or not, so they went to war to preserve it.
