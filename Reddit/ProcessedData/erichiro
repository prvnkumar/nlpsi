So under this system, instead of voting for an individual, you vote for the party that most lines up with your ideals. Each party publishes a party roll, basically a list of people who will fill any seats they get. The seats are filled in the order the names are on the list, so if the Democratic Party wins 56 seats, then the first fifty six congressmen (or MPs I suppose) get seated, everyone else waits till next time. \n\nThere is also generally a minimum percentage of votes required to get seats. In Germany, the percentage is 5%, for example. That means that any party wishing to be seated in Congress must get at least 5% of the votes during each election. If they fail to do this, they lose all of their seats. This happened in the most recent German election, when the party that was the coalition partner for Angela Merkel's party was voted out of Congress for the first time ever.\n\nThe brilliant thing about this is that it leads to the creation of many more political parties than we currently have in the US. There are many parties that are very similar, but differ on one or two key issues, which allow them to caucus together on issues they agree upon, as opposed to the two big parties in the US, which differ on just about everything and generally have to get things done by sheer numbers. I'm sure you've heard of Sweden's [Pirate Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Party_\\(Sweden\\)), which fights for individual privacy rights as their main issue. Pretty much every parliamentary democracy has a communist party, a socialist party, some sort of environmental party, etc. The Brits even have something called the [Offical Monster Raving Loony Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Monster_Raving_Loony_Party), which started as a joke but actually has several local officials elected under their banner.\n\nAs for the executive branch, it can differ. Countries like France have both a Prime Minister and a President. The Prime Minister is elected internally by the legislature, (see [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister#Entry_into_Office) for more information, it can happen many different ways) and the President is elected in essentially the same way we do it in America. If we applied this system to America, it would be akin to John Boehner being Prime Minister, and Barack Obama being President. In systems with both a President and a Prime Minister, the Prime Minister is usually in charge of domestic matters, and the President is usually in charge of foreign relations. (The way the American constitution was originally laid out.)\n\nSome nations, like Britain, have just a Prime Minister, with the Queen as the \"head of state\". The Prime Minister acts with \"royal prerogative\" , effectively making him or her the de facto head of state.\n\ntl;dr It depends on what parliamentary system you adopt, there are several different kinds, each with their own quirks and differences.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd7pve7", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1383701836", "ups": 5, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t3_1pys2k", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1428775314, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cd7ondq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1383698798", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}

To qualify under the Third Geneva Convention, a combatant must have conducted military operations according to the laws and customs of war, be part of a chain of command, wear a \"fixed distinctive marking, visible from a distance\" and bear arms openly. (The Convention recognizes a few other groups as well, such as persons \"who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units\".)\n\n\n&gt;&gt;Thus, uniforms and/or badges are important in determining prisoner-of-war status; and francs-tireurs, terrorists, saboteurs, mercenaries and spies do not qualify. In practice, these criteria are rarely interpreted strictly. Guerrillas, for example, usually do not wear a uniform or carry arms openly, but captured guerrillas are often granted POW status.\n\n&gt;&gt;The criteria are applied primarily to international armed conflicts; in civil wars, insurgents are often treated as traitors or criminals by government forces, and are sometimes executed. However, in the American Civil War, both sides treated captured troops as POWs, presumably out of reciprocity, although the Union regarded Confederate personnel as separatist rebels.

Because all independent research would disagree but there is no profit in that.\n\n\n", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "reddititis", "id": "t1_c913j4b", "parent_id": "t1_c912lyq", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431680055, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1au4vh", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c913j4b", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364067077", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c912lyq", "parent_id": "t1_c912jum", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431679623, "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": 1364064184, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1au4vh", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c912lyq", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364063802", "distinguished": null, "ups": 1}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "reddititis", "id": "t1_c912jum", "parent_id": "t1_c911jdg", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431679595, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1364064499, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c912jum", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364063598", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c911jdg", "parent_id": "t1_c90yqud", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431679116, "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1au4vh", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c911jdg", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364059976", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "reddititis", "id": "t1_c90yqud", "parent_id": "t1_c90u5jb", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431677800, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1au4vh", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c90yqud", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364048598", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "[deleted]", "id": "t1_c911p4i", "parent_id": "t1_c90zix6", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1431679192, "controversiality": 0, "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1au4vh", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c911p4i", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1364060542", "distinguished": null, "ups": 0}], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "punarvasu", "id": "t1_c90zix6", "parent_id": "t1_c90u5jb", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1431678169, "controversiality": 0, "body": "you're making a really tough argument.  those countries spend much less than we do and get better health outcomes. we spend nearly 18% of gdp now... france is at 11 or 12% I think, Sweden is around 9%.  \n\nyou're assuming it's this expensive technology that makes for better care, but that's obviously not the case. their care is cheaper because they use less of these expensive modern things, and because their health systems on the whole have lower prices.

The health provider keeps this in check by gouging insurance companies of other patients to make up for that risk. And I get stuck with an outsized bill that's been bid up by those other insurance companies. Who loses? The insured, who pay higher premiums, and myself, stuck with a bill I can't pay.\n\nIf we can enlarge the pool of insured individuals and include not only the healthy but also those who need care, would widen the resource pool for everybody and reduce risk.

Capitalism came after and led to Ford/Farben etc bypassing their governments to make money off the war, and people like the Bush family making a mint by committing treason.... by overcharging  all the government like in the medical industry today, ironic.\n\nTesla was not a capitalist. You just picked a perfect example of what capitalism does with good ideas, ask edison and look at the price fixing etc and destruction of intellectual property (AC/DC) to maintain his hold on the markets. He didn't invent the x-ray, it was Rontgen (crediting tesla is a bit of a reach even if rontgen was an accident). \n\nThat would be the same reason why there is a brain drain to the US of ideas/personnel etc Greed and that is the same reason why your hospitals are overpriced. It has nothing to do with research and everything to do with massive profits. (I have a friend who runs some and explained how ridiculous your system is, where the money goes, he takes a very large paycheck for essentially overcharging for everything and negotiating lower prices with suppliers etc (his dad started a major pharma company which helps)).\n\nPenicillin - Ian Flemming Public Hospital London.\n\nFirst artificial heart - Dutch Guy public hospital Holland. (taken to next level (internal) and patented and released for profit by NY company, original idea while external was free technology.)\n\nTest -Tube babies - Oldham University Hospital - public.\n\nI could add a few more but the level of contribution from socialist style countries would probably require you to spend a small fortune on a hospital. The circlejerk is complete.\n\nNumber one cause of Bankruptcy in the US is medical expenses. That is not a good system.\n\nGet sick, die broke, your system is nearly feudal now: \nOnly way to get to college if poor... join the army, \nOnly way to get healthcare.. join the army, \ncause only the rich can have it for free. \n\n ", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "The french had a centralised scientific community which pooled resources in public hospitals and universities as do the UK.

It is the intellectual capital, not capitalism that makes these contributions.\nAmerica has a monopoly in modern times due to peace and stability and scale. Europe is only getting back on its feet as a scientific community recently and is essentially outside of cern and a few other enterprises, small countries competing against each other in a capitalist system.

I think that they will probably get vouchers that will pay for some kind of healthcare partially, but the cost of healthcare in those low value plans is huge, so they will need substantial subsidies to make the care affordable.. I suspect that Congress wont be able to agree on this issue and it will prove that we wasted six to eight years on something which anybody could have told us would happen.\n\nMedicaid is not insurance, medicaid is only available to the most indigent people, and its a loan, at least in theory, people have to pay it back, and I think potentially, the amount of money which ends up not going to their children, to the next generation, is substantial. The same problem occurs because of these unnecessary premiums, and out of pocket costs.\n\nWhat being in medicaid would do to people is make it so they could not get a better job without suddenly not being able to afford healthcare. So, its in a very real sense a worker nullification program. \n\nLook at all the money people will have to spend, as much as a new mortgage for many people.\n\nIn Canada, that money would go to the next generation. The difference will be very noticeable, I think as much as half a million dollars per person over the course of a lifetime.\n\nThe bizarre thing is that the US government currently pays more than 60% of all healthcare bills in the US, in other words, we are already paying in taxes what we could be spending to have a completely free, single payer system. if we simply eliminated the tiers which create a lot of the waste..
