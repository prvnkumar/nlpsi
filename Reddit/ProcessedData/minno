That unusual request was granted, and Debs spoke for two hours. He was found guilty on September 12. At his sentencing hearing on September 14, he again addressed the court, and his speech has become a classic.

If there were free trade, the car manufacturing industry would leave Georgia and move to Michigan, allowing Georgian consumers to enjoy lower costs thanks to free trade. \nGeorgia will now produce the products in which it has a comparative advantage. There will be job losses in the car industry, but job gains in other areas. \n\nThis is very simplistic but it should give you an idea of what the advantages of free trade are and why free trade is good for everyone involved (usually). \n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1r88r7", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdko4qf", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1385150272", "ups": 7, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t3_1r88r7", "score": 13, "retrieved_on": 1428550605, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cdknjnj", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1385148875", "ups": 13, "distinguished": null}

I don't think it's unreasonable to assume that the CIA or DOD or other similar organization would be capable of having a contingency plan for a scenario such as what happened.
