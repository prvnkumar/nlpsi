People love having an identifiable bad guy that they can accuse of being the puppetmaster, if you will.  Harry Potter has Voldemort, the right wingers have George Soros, and the left has the Koch Brothers.  In many circles, especially in echo chambers like /r/politics, they symbolize the entire far right wing.\n\nHowever, they are a somewhat unique force in modern politics due to their relationship with the Tea Party.  The Tea Party is very much a populist movement.  However, they are also inherently limited to a fairly small minority of the electorate.  Populist movements have to keep growing in popularity or die out.  Movements like Occupy that don't continue to gain popular support quickly fizzle out, while movements like Civil Rights eventually gain widespread enough appeal to affect change and survive.  \n\nBut the Tea Party is very much an exception to that rule.  And no, the Tea Party is far from dying.  The Tea Party wave has peaked in terms of general election politics, but it is still very much the grassroots side of the GOP and one of the most powerful factions of either party.  And the reason for that is money.  In addition to being the populist movement driven by heavily involved right wing voters, it is also a well funded special interest, and the Koch Brothers are at the center of all that money.  \n\nThe Tea Party as a grassroots organization would have long since fizzled out or at best become a very minor faction of the GOP (think hardcore environmentalists in the Democratic Party) if they didn't have massive financial backing.  The establishment/big business side of the GOP is essentially waging war against the Tea Party because the Tea Party pulls the GOP in a direction that doesn't serve their interests.

Similarly (but not to the same degree) \"birders\" very much care about birds, bird songs, and bird numbers.  It's a hobby that a lot of people take very seriously.\n\nNow, for some science (FYI, I have a degree in wildlife biology, and a minor in natural resources):\n\nThe idea of high-frequency, low-intensity burns only applies to some types of forests.  Areas like Yellowstone National Park historically are low-frequency, high intensity burns.  Pretty much, the entire forest used to burn to the ground every 200(ish) years.  Alternately, many forests (like redwood and oak) are high-frequency, low intensity burns naturally.  But even that aside, I wouldn't want even a non-crazy fire to threaten my house, health, or property - especially if it was human-caused.\n\nWildlife has a huge economic benefit as well.  Hawks and owls keep rodent populations in check, while some woodpeckers slow the spread of parasitic bugs.  Squirrels and birds are pretty much solely responsible for the spread of acorns, and therefore oak reproduction and propagation.

Why didn't they write the ACA so that it covers more than half of America.\n\nI appreciate your research that found that rather than 100% of his income it would only be 30%.

This creates a coverage gap because the law was written thinking that everyone under 138% of FPL (federal poverty level, which is $11,490 for an individual; $23,550 for a family of four) would have access to Medicaid, so private plan subsidies only go down to 100% of FPL.  That means that if you're under 100% of FPL, you can't get any subsidies through the exchanges.  Plus, refusal to expand Medicaid fucks hospitals because the ACA reduces DSH (disproportionate share hospital) payments that used to go to offset the cost of uncompensated care because most of those previously receiving uncompensated care were intended to now be eligible for Medicaid.  \n\nAlso, most red states didn't create their own exchanges so they couldn't be accused of \"facilitating\" the ACA.

Make sure you're not just reaffirming your preconceived notions that you're somehow better than the \"ignorant, racist Southerners.\" \n\n&gt; southern sociocultural fear of crime\n\nThat's a lot of buzzwords, but are you seriously saying that you wouldn't mind being mugged?  What about a home invasion that is likely to turn extremely violent?  I'd say that doing everything to avoid being the victim of a crime is simply common sense.  \n\n&gt; I don't own a handgun, because I don't traffic weapons (or drugs) \n\nI'm not really sure where you're going with that.  Nobody wants criminals to have guns.  But they do get them anyway.  Also, the South is not some \"Mexican Standoff\" like from a movie.  The notion that carry permit holders run around shooting each other is false.  Imo, if anyone is beholden to irrational fear, it's the people that are afraid of law abiding citizens having guns, which has been shown over and over not to be a problem, than the people that don't want to get armed robbed or raped. \n\n&gt; why can't the Republican Party attract anyone other than older white people\n\nThere's a ton of racial messaging in GOP politics, but that doesn't mean that every policy platform supported by the Republicans in inherently racist.  And if gun control was so popular, why are pretty much all the candidates preparing to run in competitive districts next year either pro-gun rights or silent on the issue?", "id": "t1_cd5w69p", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "gsfgf", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "these strawman arguments are annoying :(\n\n\n&gt;First off, we have far more poverty and crime here than in blue states. That's not a perception; it's a fact.\n\nwhen you look at the data, 7 of the top 10 [poorest states (per capita)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_income) in the nation are in the South, but only 4 of the top 10 states in [violent crime](http://blogs.findlaw.com/blotter/2013/09/10-states-with-the-highest-rates-of-violent-crime.html) were from the South. \n\nso poverty? yes. violent crime? no.  also, who said i was advocating the notion that \"Southerners want guns to shoot black people\"? the study doesn't say that at all, and i'm not saying that at all.  my point was this:\n\nif it's empirically true that the South isn't significantly more dangerous than the rest of the nation, then something else underpins the perception that crime is especially problematic and the answer is more guns and less restrictive public policy.  \n\nat first, your reply was that \"well the south IS more crime-ridden and poor\". Empirically, that's a mixed bag, but doubtful.  If the top 10 violent crime filled states in the nation, 4 are from the south, and 3 are from the northeast.  And while there's undoubtedly a relationship between poverty and violent crime, it'd be irresponsible to say that they're correlated, as i have no facts to back that up.  Only 4 states show up on both violent crime AND poverty top 10's. \n\n&gt;southern sociocultural fear of crime\n\nso as it's not empirically true that violent crime is more prevalent in the South, then what you're looking at that underpins the idea of \"more guns and less restrictive public policy\" must be a perception that violent crime is more prevalent in the South. (in fact, you even said so yourself in a couple of different places)  Here in the northeast, we don't have this perception as a whole, and it certainly doesn't underpin high levels of gun ownership and less restrictive public policy.\n\nso then back to the question of \"what does then?\"  The study suggests that latent racism correlates with gun ownership and less restrictive public policy.   \n\nHonestly, i thought this would have been picked apart by now.  there's no even plausible counter-explanation?

It's not really about what's in the ACA; it's about the mere existence of the law.  The Republicans have been fighting the ACA tooth an nail, essentially as a way to continually go after the president.\n\nSince most Congresspeople (on both sides) are in safe, gerrymandered districts, the important election is the party primary.

For a Republican concerned with a primary election, being willing to shut down the government and cause a default as \"no compromise\" opposition to the ACA is good primary politics.  The Republicans that ended up voting to reopen the government will have their vote used against them in the primary, though many of them are in moderate enough districts that they'll still win.  \n\nThe Dems didn't cave for two reasons.  First, they didn't have to.  Most voters realize that trying to repeal an existing law as a prerequisite to passing an appropriations bill is absurd.

That's part of the reason it's so popular: any idiot who can get his hands on some glassware can make it in his kitchen. Contrast that with production of LSD, which chem nerds at CalTech used to do for a fun challenge, and which essentially stopped in the US a few years ago when one production facility got busted (though I believe that situation has since corrected itself).\n\n&gt; That's why despite the marijuana \"infrastructure\" in Mexico, no one in California or Colorado or any other legal/semi-legal state imports from Mexico.\n\nThey don't import from Mexico because, as you say, it's illegal.

The majority of products consumed in this country are produced overseas. Why would this be any different?\n\n&gt;We could always fully legalize drugs in the US and prevent importation for 10 years, to have an even greater effect on destroying the cartels.\n\nThis might work, but it also might be impossible.

The production facilities. Of course, I suppose the actual manufacture probably takes place abroad.\n\nI guess I just see how quickly people move as close to legal means of production as possible with partial legalization in places like Washington or medical marijuana states. For instance, California does not import marijuana for use in California (it is possible or even likely marijuana may move through California from Mexico to other states). Legal consumption of marijuana universally comes from legal production of marijuana. Drug production would start to occur in the first world with full legalization. Poorer countries produce the majority of illegal drugs because they face less legal pressure than in richer countries (ie, it is dramatically cheaper for them to produce in Mexico and import to the US than to produce in the US). With legalization, it immediately becomes cheaper to produce in the US. That's why despite the marijuana \"infrastructure\" in Mexico, no one in California or Colorado or any other legal/semi-legal state imports from Mexico. Another example is Canada. Canada does not have as intense a focus on preventing marijuana production as the US has/had. As a result, marijuana was primarily grown  in the country. The cost of illegal production was lower, so there was no incentive to import from other countries.\n\nA lot of the details can change depending on how legalization might occur. For instance, is the United States the only first world country that is legalizing and do all the countries that manufacture the drugs currently also legalize? We could always fully legalize drugs in the US and prevent importation for 10 years, to have an even greater effect on destroying the cartels.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_1oes0r", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ccrpu9w", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1381788553", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t1_ccrjryb", "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1429133842, "controversiality": 0, "body": "It is much cheaper after you put in the investment involved in the production facilities. Some drugs require (pot, mushrooms) require very little investment because they're essentially ready to go as soon as they're grown and you're probably right about those, but that's not the case for many others (eg. meth, LSD, cocaine). The cartels have already done that, outside the US. The same groups which are currently funneling drugs illegally into the US will simply become the ones who bring them in legally. In the first world, large companies don't generally engage in violence towards each other or towards people who do things counter to their interests, but that's not always true in other parts of the world.\n\nAs far as what pharmaceutical companies would do, it's not at all clear to me that they would get involved. They could be legally producing purer forms of nicotine or caffeine for legal sale to consumers, but they don't because the margins suck compared to prescription drugs. If hard drugs were legalized, the bottom would drop out of the market and the price would plummet. That would just put them in the same position that currently legal drugs are currently in.\n\n&gt; I imagine that's pretty much the most difficult drug to produce as well\n\nIt's not.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I've had a feeling that a post like this was coming.  It's definitely a tough issue.  So here are my thoughts in a hopefully not too rambling fashion.  \n\nUnlike /r/AskScience or /r/AskHistorians, politics isn't an academic field.  (Sorry, poly sci students).  At the end of the day, politics comes down to elections, which turn on emotion not citable fact, which makes things harder.  /r/AskScience can delete a post for being wrong.  Obviously, we can't do that here.  /r/AskHistorians can delete a post for not being cited because history, by definition, is the study of things that were written down in the past.  We don't have nearly as clear a metric.  \n\nSo I'll put on my policy wonk hat for a while because it's the offseason and I'm bored:  \n\nThe first issue is what are the harms that are sought to be avoided:\n\n1. One concern is a constant deluge of the same old crap.  That's a more complicated issue here because stuff changes so fast.  /r/AskHistorians can have it's Frequently Asked Questions wiki because significant changes to the historical record, especially for popular topics, are relatively few and far between, so a post from last year on Rome is probably still accurate.  Clearly, a post on Syria from last year would be irrelevant.  It may be worth trying to consolidate current events threads into mega-threads that are replaced every few days or so.  Not only would that combat front page clutter, it would consolidate discussion into one larger thread instead of a bunch of small ones.  \n\n2. Garbage threads.  As you mention in your post, we have quite a lot of posts that are simply not very good.  Part of that definitely comes from the fact that we have limited readership, so everything, even if it has downvotes and few responses, stays on the front page for a while.  However, that is inevitable in a sub with few posts, and trying to delete them could lead to accidentally deleting posts that lead to a good discussion.  For example, there is a \"who's the smartest choice for Senate/Congress in 2014\" thread.  That clearly looks like garbage post, but it led to a pretty good discussion of the KY Senate race.   So, imo, downvote and move on is the best strategy, at least until we get bigger.  \n\n3. People who only want to validate their preconceived conceptions.  My biggest pet peeve on here is when someone is clearly not interested in a discussion.  Even worse, is that you'll often see a good post with downvotes and a garbage response.  While frustrating, it sort of reflects political realities.  If I knew how to have people keep an open mind instead of acting on preconceived notions, I'd be getting paid a lot more money.  \n\nSecond, and probably more important, is how to grow the subreddit.  The minimal activity has a lot to do with why garbage doesn't get \"downvoted to oblivion.\"  \n\nOne idea is to have weekly threads.  A lot of the better subs have weekly threads, such as /r/nfl's trash alk threads, /r/fitness' nutrition threads, /r/AskHistorians' trivia threads, etc.  Some ideas are a basic civics thread where people can ask questions about how gov't works, a controversial opinion thread where we disable downvotes, a state/local politics thread, etc.  It's a good discussion prompt and as we find popular ideas, it'll drive readership.  \n\nAs for tags, I assume you mean like [Campaign], [Legal], [World Politics], etc.?  Seems like a good enough idea to me.  I'd advise keeping things relatively broad to start and maybe adding more detailed tags as the sub grows.  Iirc, that's what /r/AskScience did.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1jafs8", "selftext": "One of my biggest problems with the libertarian thing is that I think the government is supposed to create an environment where it's hard to screw people, regardless of whether people are capable of protecting themselves with enough effort.  Some reasons are as follows:\n\nSometimes, people simply have a disparity in bargaining power.  For example, I think it's good for the gov't to institute a price floor for wages because people aren't in a position to really bargain hard for wages when they need jobs and got bills to pay.  Sure, it eliminates one's freedom to work for less (and I've argued that with a libertarian recently), but I'm ok with that.  \n\nSometimes, there's a disparity in information and expertise.  For example, to rebut /u/AuditorTux's example, people can get second opinions on a mortgage, but you're engaging in a massively complex transaction with minimal if any experience.  On the other hand the financial institution does this all day, every day, it has trained staff, and it has access to market data that an individual simply doesn't have.  Therefore, I think it's a good idea to place most of the burden of not signing a bad mortgage on the bank.  Especially, when *everyone* has to suffer the results of bad mortgages through decreased property values, vacancies, reduced local tax bases, etc.\n\nSometimes, it's worthwhile to not *have* to be an expert on everything.  I pay my damn taxes, the gov't can use it's resources to create a regulatory environment instead of requiring each person to become an expert on everything him or herself.  \n\nI hope that makes sense, or is at least good discussion fodder.

Why not simply suggest people live my the rule \"Unless you fully understand it, don't sign\".  A 30-year fixed note is rather simple - you are going to pay the same amount monthly, 360 times.  Nothing will change (sans escrow, which can be explained rather easily) and then the *only* variables are the interest rate, the purchase price and your downpayment.  That's it.  Even if you think that you might not be getting the best interest rate, you should darn well know whether your comfortable with the other two.  And if someone wants to go to something slightly more exotic, there are 15- and 12-year notes.  More monthly, but fewer overall payments.\n\nThe problem was when people get greedy and went into 5/1 ARMs thinking that in 5 years the market would be higher and they could refinance into 30-year fixed at a lower rate, as prices had been constantly increasing and rates had remained low for half-a-decade.

They know that when the Democrats come in, the districts will be re-gerrymandered in favor of the Democratic party. Having done this themselves for the past two decades, the GOP has no cause to complain if that happens.  \n\nHowever, proportional representation provides them with an option to \"hedge\" against that future by preserving that the proportion of votes will be equal to the proportion of people who support their policies, and that even in opposition, they will be able to get some measures passed if they can get the approval of coalition partners. \n\nAs for the Democrats, the Democrats will be able to re-energize the party by making every vote in every district count; a truly competitive Texas.  Additionally, by allowing elements of the Democratic party to break off and form third parties that are only viable under PR, they can start do something they never have in my lifetime: Provide a cohesive, fully articulated plan and vision for where the Democratic party wants to take the state of Texas.  (Currently, if you ask 10 democrats what they stand for, you'll get 11 answers.) \n\n&gt; If, as you state above, you're expecting a bloody primary fight, that makes running a worse idea. You'll just make enemies for no reason. \n\nI actually do *not* expect a bloody primary fight.  I may be running unopposed.  If I'm not running unopposed, I expect the primary fight to be amiable.  I will work to raise the profile of my issues while my opponent raises the profile of his/her name.  If two or more candidates wish to run, I will not.  \n\n&gt; The technical voting stuff doesn't play with the public at all. Bipartisan redistricting commissions, like in Iowa, do work. That may be a better focus.\n\nThe problem is that redistricting doesn't solve the problems inherent to single member district elections (like in TX and the U.S.)  Bipartisan redistricting committees may produce the most fair single member districts, but single member districts **in and of themselves produce none of the disincentive for corruption that the threat of the ballot box is supposed to induce;** furthermore, single member districts may actually encourage corruption.  I'm animating a presentation right now explaining exactly why and how that happens; and it's not a flaw in our national character.  It's mathematics.  \n\nYeah, it doesn't \"play with the public.\"  My chances of winning are damn-near nil; I'll only get the nomination if unopposed, I'll only win the election if my opponent blows up in a major sex scandal.  But dammit, it's never going to \"play with the public\" unless someone goes out there and starts talking about it.  Most state representatives haven't even *heard* of proportional representation.  \n\nAnyway, my last presentation got 90,000 views; the one before that got 470,000, so I'm pretty optimistic that I can get the ball rolling. \n\n&gt; Autism is \"trendy\" now. You can play that to your favor. Even Republicans are all about autistic kids these days.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that \"autistic kids\" eventually become \"autistic adults\" and that we're a viable part of society. Too often, people on the spectrum don't get work they're qualified for - or lose jobs they're qualified for - because their social quirks make people uncomfortable.  These are, in some cases, *brilliant* people who don't get listened to because there's a delay in processing a facial expression like a smile or a frown.  Something like 90% of people with Aspergers (the \"mild\" form of Autism that I have) are unemployed; that number is far, far too high. \n\nAutism isn't something that's just about kids, is what I'm saying.  Yes, kids have it the roughest, because childhood is far more about learning social interaction than anything else.  And it does get better as you grow older.  But there are still challenges out there, and it is important that we start looking for ways that we can take advantage of the brilliance of the misfits.  \n", "id": "t1_cay3zk5", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "BrianBoyko", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cay0lhm", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1430546276, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cay3zk5", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1373271642", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}], "parent_id": "t3_1htuxm", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1430548103, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "lawyer", "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cay0lhm", "author_flair_text": "[Attorney/Leg.

He should only be following to make sure the person isn't up to something.  There is *absolutely nothing wrong with that*.

Macho came out, one of them was itching to prove a point or \"be a man\" and things spiraled out of control.\n\nBut they both made decisions to lead up to that point.  Whether they were using or not using a right isn't the issue - what we need to know is what actually started the physical confrontation that, according to Zimmerman, made him fear for his life and justify using the gun.  Zimmerman following Martin was not that start - it could have ended peacefully if both followed the \"do no harm\" rule.  Martin cutting through the neighborhood did not start that.  It was an insult, an act, or *something* that started those final events into play.\n\nThat's what we need to know.  All this BS about \"he profiled\" or stuff is beyond the point.  It doesn't matter if he profiled or not.

A. . . **The first change is a clarification that FISA warrants are not needed for \u201csurveillance directed at a person reasonably believed to be located outside of the United States.\u201d** That is, if the government is monitoring someone outside the United States from a telecom switch in the U.S., it can listen in on the person\u2019s calls and read their e-mails without obtaining a FISA warrant first. The Fourth Amendment may still require reasonableness in this setting when one or more people on the call of e-mail are inside the U.S. or are United States citizens, but there is no statutory warrant requirement.\n\n&gt;**The second change is a requirement of a formal authorization of a program to do such monitoring. The Director of National Intelligence and the AG have to approve a program (for up to one year) reasonably designed to be limited to the monitoring of persons outside the United States. Those procedures have to be submitted to the FISA court, which then reviews whether the Executive\u2019s conclusion that the procedures are reasonably designed to only pick up the communications of people reasonably believed to be outside the U.S. is \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d** If the conclusion is clearly erroneous, the court sends them back and tells the Executive to try again. The government can also appeal that determination to the FISA Court of Review and if needed the Supreme Court. I\u2019m not exactly sure, but my sense is that this is a one-size-fits-all order; that is, the one authorization covers all the providers.", "edited": 1370917769, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cagbi9x", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1370917286", "ups": 3, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1g2311", "selftext": "Two things. \n\n&gt;The constitution does not apply to non-US citizens.
