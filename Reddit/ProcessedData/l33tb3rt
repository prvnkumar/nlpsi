{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1xu8nq", "selftext": "&gt;but why can't Obama create public hospitals to press the wages down.\n\nWell, there is a most likely a link between pay and performance.  If there isn't, you run into a problem of retaining skilled doctors.  As experience increases, so does the expectations of having payment in line with said experience.  Eventually you would experience a \"brain drain\" of doctors using the public hospital as a spring board to the more lucrative private hospital.\n\nAdditionally, you have a political climate where the government doing anything like that is political suicide.  Obama literally repackaged a GOP idea, and then was crucified for it.  Then, when the first misdiagnosis happens, the right will spiral out of control talking about death panels, incompetence, blah blah blah.  They freaked the fuck out over having people buy health insurance, again their idea, with claims of death panels, rationing of care, and other apocalyptic predictions. \n\nLastly, it's not the price of doctors that inflate costs.  It's not having an incentive to treat people correctly the first time that increases prices.  With health insurance, you can kick the can down the road with pensive diagnosing (take this and call me in two weeks).  Why would you not?  If you're getting paid for visits, might as well milk it for all that you can.  As a hospital, if you can charge $25 for a band aid and $100 for gauze, why would you not?  Along those same lines, we are a nation of hypochondriacs.  Watch any TV program and you get bombarded with commercials for the new wunder pill.  Feel tired when you wake up?  Talk to your doctor about WakeUpRight!  And the advent of junk websites like WebMD only increase the notion that we are always ill.  Hey Doc, I took a quiz on WebMD and I'm pretty certain I have stage 5 million cancer.  You disagree?!  What do *you* know?  I want a second opinion!\"\n\n&gt;I am sure that some Doctors would be willing to go down in wages to help other human beings.\n\nHa.  Yeah, no.  For the most part, people are self interested actors.  Only a very select few answer the call for public service.  Would you take a cut in wages for the warm fuzzies of helping someone else out?  Not likely.

Thus, a person who is born on the ocean is a subject of the prince to whom his parents then owe allegiance; for he is still deemed under the protection of his sovereign, and born in a place where he has dominion in common with all other sovereigns. So the children of an ambassador are held to be subjects of the prince whom he represents, although born under the actual protection and in the dominions of a foreign prince.\"\n\nSecond, [Elk v.

You have yet to establish how CC's presidential prospects are causing Bridgegate to receive more coverage, largely because you haven't demonstrated that it is getting more coverage. \n\nI stipulated that it may not be getting more coverage than the Sandford scandal to argue the more important point about salience. Bridgegate is more important than the Sandford infidelity scandal because it has moved his poll numbers in the POTUS race. And if you think that his poll numbers haven't moved on this scandal, I refer you back to my point about the 30s ad and also to the numerous polls that directly ask about Bridgegate (like [this](http://nypost.com/2014/01/11/nj-poll-christie-knew-about-bridgegate-should-quit/) one: \"Only 36 percent believe Christie\u2019s claim that he was unaware that a top aide orchestrated the politically motivated closing of George Washington Bridge access lanes, the Rasmussen Reports survey showed\" or [this](http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/01/christies_popularity_in_wake_of_bridge_scandal_plummets_poll_shows.html) one: \"More than two-thirds of voters think the controversy has damaged Christie's chances at the White House at least somewhat, but only 23 percent say the controversy would lower their chance of supporting him at least somewhat.\"). This scandal is going to give Christie trouble in his next race regardless of the coverage or the polls (but together they paint a dark picture for him.) By contrast, Sandford easily moved past his infidelity scandal in his next race, and his next race itself was less salient (than a Presidential bid, obviously.) So the point about correlation WOULD be valid if we didn't have polling numbers on the actual scandal.\n\nEdit: a word", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1w0ol5", "selftext": "&gt; And if you think that his poll numbers haven't moved on this scandal,\n\nAnd now you're just making stuff up, shifting goalposts, etc. I'm glad RES lets me ignore people.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Term limits are a proven failure at making systems become more effective.  First, it removes all incentive to govern.  Instead of having the fear of losing reelection, term limited legislators will have an incentive to only play for those who paid for their election.  You get less legislation that will benefit the public, and more that will benefit their donors.  Said a different way, the incentive to bargain is zero.  California's budget woes of the past two decades are a perfect example of \"well, I'm not going to be around for next year's budget mess, might as well get my slice of the pie without consequence!\"\n\nOn the idea of the five year limit for POTUS.  Taking this current administration, literally nothing would have been done.  The shutdowns, poor budget decisions, etc. would all be amplified because neither side would have any incentive to bargain.  POTUS wouldn't because he is five and done.  He has a set of goals he won't budge from.  Congress have any incentive to bargain because they know he is gone in five years, if they can resist changes they've \"won.\"\n\nSecond, and perhaps more importantly, you lose institutional memory.  I know people love to think that legislating is just being wined and dined by lobbyists, but it's much more than that.  The old guard has an intimate knowledge of policy, procedure, and other factors that relate to writing laws.  When this is removed, legislators have to relearn issue areas, or they will rely on outside actors for their information.  The outside actors have a unitary interest in a given outcome, so the quality of legislation decreases.  Imagine there is a secretary at work who has been there for 20 years.  They know what the organization is about, they know who does what, and they know all processes and procedures.  They are able to get things done by virtue of this knowledge.  What happens when they have a snap retirement?  That institutional memory is gone, and the organization flounders trying to find their way.  Consequently, performance suffers.\n\nYou are half right in your idea.  Terms should be longer.  It will remove the need for such a quick reelection.  (As my old boss, a Member of Congress said, \"Your first year, you learn where the bathroom is.  The second year you have to run for reelection.  You can't start legislating until your third year.\")  Creating a revolving door vis-a-vis term limits is just plain silly.\n\nAnother good idea is to increase the number of seats in Congress.  The average House district is something like 660,000 people.  Let's make that number smaller.  Not only would the chambers be more representative, but you could see why more moderate policy would be the result.  Likewise, it's pretty dumb that Wyoming has the same power in the Senate as California.  50 times the population, the 8th or 9th largest economy in the world, and Wyoming is equal in power.\n\nSabato talks about this in [A More Perfect Constitution](http://www.amoreperfectconstitution.com/).

The larger the group, the harder it is to organize. \n\nAn interesting theory I've heard was to change Congressional districts so that they were independent of state boundaries; each Representative is in charge of an even 660,000, regardless of state boundaries, so instead of being say, the Wyoming First Congressional district which has ~570,000 constituents, it'd be, say, the Three-Hundred and Fourth Congressional District, which would include most of Wyoming and parts of Montana that has roughly 660,000 constituents.

The exchange offers subsidies toward lowering premium costs, but some people may not qualify for the subsidies.\"* http://knoxblogs.com/humphreyhill/2013/09/30/coverkids-covertn-accesstn-coverrx-either-ending-limiting-enrollment-aca/\n\n*\"The state of Tennessee this month notified thousands of residents that they will lose coverage under a TennCare-sponsored program that helps small businesses and the self-employed buy health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act. The letter states that as a limited-benefit plan, CoverTN does not cover all the services required by the federal law and will no longer exist as of Jan. 1. CoverTN had a $25,000 annual limit on benefits. The federal health law does not allow yearly expenditure caps.*\" http://www.wbir.com/story/news/health/2013/09/09/covertn-health-plan-ending/2791105/", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1ubzdv", "selftext": "So your point is that TN is violating the law.

For the purposes of this discussion, I'm limiting it to state-wide and higher elections as local elections often work somewhat differently.\n\nAs /u/urnbabyurn pointed out, it would be nearly impossible for a single person or even small group of people to push enough fake votes to actually sway an election. The actual amount of work required would be enormous and likely beyond the scale of a single person or small group. It would also require knowledge of the voter rolls themselves; who is eligible to vote but hasn't voted already and who won't vote. You can cast a provisional ballot under any name you want but those ballots have to be evaluated by the registrar's office before they're officially counted to be considered \"valid votes.\" You can fill out provisional ballots until your fingers fall off, if they're found to be fraudulent they won't ever make it into the final tally.\n\nAgain they could go in and fill out ballots under legitimate voter's names but again they'd have to know these names in advance and if that person had already voted or wasn't planing on showing up to vote. Which, barring omnipotence, would be impossible information to get.\n\nYou could have insiders rigging polls with a huge ring of people but this runs into the problem again that you'd need to fudge so many votes across such huge areas that you just couldn't do it unless you had massive cooperation among thousands of different people. It would depend on each one of those people remaining totally silent in a monumental conspiracy for ultimately no real gain (more on that later).\n\nIronically, the system being as fucked up as it is in a way saves it from this kind of fraud. The Presidential election is a prime example with the Electoral College. In elections where there are states or districts that are \"winner take all\" (if you get 51% of the vote, you win the vote(s) for that area) they're often heavily gerrymandered such that a particular party wins by a landslide pretty much regardless of who they put on the ticket. This means if you want to rig the election through voter fraud as the party not in power, you'd have to do exponentially more work just to catch up to the incumbent party. And a massive un-expected win in a normally other-party stronghold with wonky turnout numbers is virtually guaranteed to be investigated.\n\nThink of it like counterfeiting pennies. Yes, pennies are legal tender and counterfeiting them is illegal. However nobody does it because the benefit from doing so is exponentially less than the work you'll put into it and the risk you have to take to accomplish it that it isn't worth it.\n\nContinuing from above, election rigging isn't really a thing because there's no *need* to.\n\nFor starters, the parties can already legally do this. Gerrymandering is, essentially, legalized election rigging and it's rampant. CGP Grey made a great [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mky11UJb9AY) that explains this in greater detail.\n\nIt's also not needed because most political figures are going to vote the same way regardless of who they are. They'll fight over hot-button social issues that don't really mean much of anything but the vast majority will obey the wishes of the private interests that fund their campaigns and effectively put them into power. A company donating money to a super PAC doesn't care if the politician who gets elected is wearing a red tie or a blue one, so long as they repay that donation with favorable legislative decisions. This is why most companies that donate to [both](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/list.php) parties so they can curry favor with whoever wins the election.\n\nVoter fraud is not a problem and there is absolutely no evidence to indicate that it is.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "No, not really.  The White House is aware of the wealth inequality.  Protesting in front of the WH would be window dressing.  In fact, protesting in general is a largely ineffective method of creating change.  Will it matter if you go protest in the Capitol?  Nope.  MOC's are bombarded with gimmicky shit all day.  If you were serious about wanting to change the situation you would throw those impeding wealth equality out.\n\nTwo quick case studies in doing it wrong, and doing it right.\n\nOccupy Wall Street was a pointless activity from the start.  First, they had no coordinated message.  Having every social justice cause under one roof will lead you to disappointing results.  You need a single sentence as to what the problem is, and then a single sentence to what your solution is.  Likewise, not having a press person detracts from you message.  If you are electing your spokesman via snaps, no one will listen.  Second, they targeted the wrong people.  Did anyone honestly think that Wall Street was going to see the protests and say \"You know, they are right.  We are greedy and killing the middle class.  We are going to voluntarily raise our taxes!  Thanks for opening our eyes to us being jerkoffs OWS.\"  The end result?  Nothing changed.\n\nThe Tea Party was masterful at creating change.  Their protests were focused at the people who mattered: Their House Representatives.  They were at town halls making people listen to them.  They had a simple message of the problem, and the solution.  You had two steering organizations who could offer press releases.  More importantly, they went out and voted.  They talked the talk (support this or we will throw you out), then walked the walk.  Getting a primary challenger made a lot of politicians take notice.  They made massive GOTV efforts.\n\nLearn from the Tea Party.  Quit playing fuck fuck games with e-petitions, and pointless symbolism.  Go to the town halls, and question your representatives.  Get involved in GOTV efforts.  Help people get registered.  Drive people to the polls.

Oddly enough, some people view the cost of postage (sometimes more than a dollar) as an unnecessary barrier to actually voting.  This should be a free service of USPS, along the same lines of franking by MOC's.\n\n * Open more polling locations.

They write laws.  The executive branch are the implementers.\n\n&gt;Is there more to the process that I am unaware of?\n\nAbsolutely there is.  First you have to identify a current problem that exists within your political world.  Then you have to go read through current law to see where a change can be made.  Then you have to write a careful wording of what changes you want.  (Laws are written in legalese for a reason.)  You get counsel from your staff about the potential impacts of said legislation on your district and constituents.  Then you go to committee to hammer out changes, and hear from other experts about the subject matter.  When it comes to budgets, you literally have to take account of thousands of federal programs.  And outstanding debts.  And revenue shortfalls.  And emergency funding.\n\n\n&gt;In other words, at least at the federal level, wouldn't it be possible to make the full text of a proposed bill available online at the same moment it is available to congress members and then let the population go to a voting booth within the month to vote on it?\n\nFirst, the proposed text of a bill is available [on-line](thomas.loc.gov).

When will you find the time to read 10 bills a day, then make an informed vote on each one of those?  Better yet, at what part of the process do you want to have people vote?  Is it after the experts on committee have marked it up, or just as soon as it is introduced?  If it's the latter, are you prepared for this system to be gamed by people introducing the legislation that would have negative consequences by under a clever name?\n\nLikewise, how do you deal with budgets?  Will the CBO say \"Okay, we have tax receipts of $3.8 trillion this year.  Knock yourselves out.\"  The consequence of that is the most organized voter bloc will win out.

When citizens feel their opinions are underrepresented, what do we do? Form a lobby? Does it have a chance of competing with gigantic multimillion dollar lobbies? What about issues that are important to our country but that are not immediately important during any one election cycle? We have social scientists and politicians with data showing that our security can be more efficiently guaranteed without the kind of spending we are doing on expanding the TSA... yet we still do it. Is this because it is best for the country? The data does not seem to show that... Is it because the majority of Americans want that? Perhaps that can be inferred by the fact that politicians said they voted based on what they thought their constituents wanted... but that is only an inference. It is quite possible there are 3 options that have different ratings of efficiency and effectiveness. How does the congressman determine which path is best? I have to say that from the outside it seems influenced most by lobbyists, not public opinion or even what is best for the public. Just what is best for the most influential lobbyists.\n\nI just get tired of taxes going up and debt going up and programs we citizens see on the street level disappearing despite the miniscule portion of the budget they represent. What am I paying for with my taxes? The gigantic car some guy drives who I'll never meet so he can go on the news and talk about guns or abortions or gay marriage? So he can redistrict states to win the same elections promising the same things their P.R. department tells them to promise?\n\nBasically, is the system the way it is today too different from the worst-case scenario democracy? In our system a republican can basically do as he pleases and say \"what, are you going to vote for me or the baby killer?\" and then and go cut NASA not because people want it or it is best for the country but because he only has so much money and other interests have better lobbies. They then spin the cuts as an attempt to lower the budget because that is what their demographic wants to hear.

There is usually a baseline for a family (two adults + 1 child = X) with a bump for each additional child.  As you'll see below, the bump is roughly $90 per child.  That is, you ain't going to get rich spitting out babies.\n\nI suggest you look at the data from FY2010 for [AFDC/TANF](http://archive.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ofa/character/fy2010/fy2010_chap10_ys_final.html).  There are some surprising factoids for folks who believe in the existence of the baby-making welfare queen:\n\n * The average number of persons in TANF families was 2.4, including an average of 1.8 recipient children.  One in two recipient families had only one child.  Less than eight percent of families had more than three children.  The average number of children in closed-case families was 1.8.  Nearly one in two closed-case families had one child, and only seven percent had more than three children.\n\n * Eighty-two percent of TANF families received SNAP benefits in FY 2010, which is consistent with previous levels.  These families received average monthly SNAP benefits of $378.  (TANF families received approximately $57,254,416,380 in food assistance.  It's crucial to note that this money goes back into the economy.)\n\n * The average monthly amount of assistance for TANF recipient families was $392 in FY 2010.  Monthly cash payments to TANF families averaged $327 for one child, $412 for two children, $497 for three children, and $594 for four or more children.  Some TANF families who were not employed received other forms of assistance such as child care, transportation and other supportive services.\n\n * In FY 2010, about 17 percent of TANF families had non-TANF income.  The average monthly amount of non-TANF income for those with non-TANF income was $720 per family.  Twelve percent of the TANF families had earned income with an average monthly amount of $823, while 6.5 percent of the TANF families had unearned income with an average monthly amount of $435.  Of all closed-case families, 31.5 percent had non-TANF income with an average monthly amount of $1,009 in the month the case closed.\n\nTL;DR: Most of the Welfare Queen comments are due to plain ignorance.", "id": "t1_cbrz1jf", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "l33tb3rt", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_1kro1n", "id": "t1_cbs45wn", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "lemontest", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_cbrz1jf", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1429755084, "controversiality": 0, "body": "TANF (previously called welfare) is partially federally funded, but administered by the states, so the states write their own regulations for the program.

There are exceptions for children resulting from rape, incest, or domestic violence.\n\nSNAP (formerly food stamps) is a separate program that does not have a family cap rule.

White nationalism simply believes that Africans, Asians, and whites should be allowed to have their own lands and that they shouldn't become minorities in their own countries.

Any time a party gets 2/3 of the House, and the President is of the opposite party, they can impeach them.  Second, the Constitution is *very* specific about what constitutes grounds for impeachment.  To [Article II, Section 4!](http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii#section4)\n\n&gt;The President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\n\nSo, in all the dealings where is enough evidence to warrant an investigation of treason (which is also *very* [narrowly defined](http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_A3Sec3.html): \"Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.\"), bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanors?

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;why is the government not run like a business?\n\nI am so tired of this stupid question, and comparison.  Business and government are meant to achieve different ends.  The former is meant to make profit, above all else.  This means they do not care about anything but the bottom line.  The latter is mean to provide equitable and effective solutions.  This means they are issuing \"blind\" rulings provided a set of rules, and that these rulings will lead to effective outcomes.  What this also means, the government has to compromise to achieve equitable and effective solutions.  A business does not.  \n\nSecond, the customers are completely different.  Each Representative has, on average, 600,000 different customers to satisfy.  And no two districts are alike.  How are you supposed to write a business plan that would make everyone happy?  You cannot.\n\nA third clear difference between the two is the nature of decision making in the institutions.  A business is a top-down model, whereas the government is a bottom-up model.  In business, the CEO can have their ideas implemented with little pushback because, well, they are the boss.  In government, however, the first step in the decision chain starts with the voters.  Then it moves up to the House and Senate.  Then to the President.  Then the Supreme Court gets to chime in.  (Yes this is an overly simple version of the process.)  Can you name a business where there are 545 decision makers, and of these 545, 275 must agree for *any* product to be put to market?  No, you cannot.\n\nFinally, what in the hell do you think a platform/issue statement is?  It's a candidates business plan.

The key here is their formula for the decision to vote:\n\n**R = (B*P) - C+D**\n\nIn this equation, the most important pieces are **C** and **D**, or respectively, the costs associated with voting and sense of civic duty in voting.  **P** is presently at [1/221,925,820](http://elections.gmu.edu/Turnout_2012G.html), making it a moot factor in the decision to vote.  That is, you will not be the deciding factor in a vote.  Likewise, the **B**enefit of your candidate winning is difficult to quantify in any meaningful way.   Any benefit would have to have to be substantially large, as the small level of value associated with **P**.  Unless, of course, you value your candidate winning at greater than or equal to 221,925,821 utils.\n\nAs far as we can tell about **D**, and thus your original question, **D** has consistently been less than **C**.  From this, the condition needed for some sort of financial incentive to matter.  \n\n**D** must be greater than **C**.  Why?  Because any **C** value greater than or equal to (BxP), if  **D** is less than **C**, will result in a negative **R**.  Now, if we introduced an incentive to the civic duty, **D^I**, this could help ensure that **D** is greater than or equal to **C**.  Unfortunately, **I** is entirely relative to the individual voter.  For example, **C** for a working poor individual who lives X miles from a polling place would be higher than the retired professor who has done absentee voting their whole life.  Let's also not forget that **C** includes non-financial costs as well, such as learning the issues on the ballot.\n\n&gt;If increasing voter activity better benefits the general public,\n\nA highly dubious claim.  Forcing people to vote does not equal better results, especially in a system where you only have two choices, in largely noncompetitive races.  But this does allow us to reevaluate where efforts should be focused.  Take **P** for example.  (And I'm going to make up a mythical district where 600,000 people are voting.)  If we were to *increase* the number of available candidates, via a larger House, what happens to **P**?  It decreases.  Let's say a larger House now makes the average district size 100,000 voters.  Thus, **P** is smaller, making **C** a bit easier to negate. \n\n", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1bmwlk", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "thejesusfinger", "id": "t1_c98ad7n", "parent_id": "t1_c986hrm", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431677111, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Wow, thank you. I appreciate you putting such thought and effort into your response. I definitely  shorthanded my point by saying that it would ensure more beneficial. What I was trying to say is that in places where voter turnout does not accurately define the makeup of the general population, we would potentially be more likely to see legislation that caters to the specific needs of the people in that district/county/state. I live in NC, a state whose policy makers seem primarily concerned with catering to older white Christians. We are seeing legislation being discussed or worse yet, passed in our state that includes a permanent ban on same-sex marriage, a state religion, blocking Obamacare and making voting harder for college students.  I don't believe that these laws and bills accurately depict the interests of the people I've met in this state. If we saw a more a accurate representation of the diversity present in our state at the polls, one could have reason to believe that this kind of legislation would be less prevalent as it could be more damaging to a legislator's hopes of re-election. \n\nA prime example would be recent marijuana laws passed in Colorado and Washington; why did they pass these laws? Because the elected officials in those states didn't think they'd lose their jobs for passing them. Same goes for the gay marriage ban passed in my state last year.

First and foremost, approximately [119 million people have access to the internet](http://www.census.gov/hhes/computer/publications/2010.html) (looking at Table 1A).  Second, you have a natural barrier because technology is still *very* foreign to many users.  Especially underserved and elderly populations.  Yes, I know your grandma is a level 13 Internetter.  Third, you have to think about the sheer size of running the government.  It isn't some nice and clean process of \"Well, we need to make a budget.  Do you support a 3.2 trillion dollar budget this year?\"  You literally thousands of items within a single budget.  How would you amend bills?  How would you even know what bills to introduce?  Piggybacking on this, you have to think about how much time it would take to make the population informed.  Congress is a full time gig for a reason--there is a lot of information to take in.  If we were to follow California's lead, and send voters texts of the proposed bills, well, [tell me if you understand the impacts of these propositions](http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/text-proposed-laws/text-of-proposed-laws.pdf)\n\n&gt;would it be a good idea?\n\nAbsolutely not.  Voters are fickle creatures, who don't think things through.  And they are very susceptible to misinformation.  Let's take Prop 8.  [The text of the proposition is as follows](http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/text-proposed-laws/text-of-proposed-laws.pdf):\n\n&gt;This initiative measure is submitted to the people in accordance with the provisions of Article II, Section 8, of the California Constitution.\nThis initiative measure expressly amends the California Constitution by \nadding a section thereto; therefore, new provisions proposed to be added are printed in italic type to indicate that they are new.\n\n&gt;SECTION 1. Title\nThis measure shall be known and may be cited as the \u201cCalifornia Marriage \nProtection Act.\u201d\n\n&gt;SECTION 2. Section 7.5 is added to Article I of the California Constitution, \nto read:\nSEC. 7.5. *Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.*\n\nThat's it.  However, people were certain Prop 8 would require students to be taught how to have gay sex, in their sex ed classes.  And public school books would have to give special sections to gay people in each period of history.  Schools would have to fly the Gay Flag above the California flag.  They were *certain* this was in the law.  Why is this important?  People are not smart enough to know what the laws mean.  They are going to fall back on their \"trusted\" sources to distill the information, and vote accordingly.  Likewise, where are people going to find the time to be active participants?  Hell, we cannot even get 50% of voters to go perform their duty once every other year, how in the hell do you expect them to pay attention and participate on a daily basis?\n\nThen you have the problems of appointments: Who gets to question them?

They are years behind the curve on technology, especially advanced technology like ICBMs.  To be blunt, [this is what you're dealing with](http://i.imgur.com/3m9QKA2.jpg).\n\n&gt;A preemptive strike might be a possibility, but would require incredible response time - \n\nThe ROK is training for this, and being trained by the best.

We don't have any concrete ideas about what he might or might not do.\n\nMeh, he's not that bad.  On the one hand, KJU is continuing policy.  The ICBM launch and nuke test are all carryovers from Dad's rule.  On the other hand, to some degree you have to establish yourself to your generals.

Originally, scholarship on the Court saw justices decisions as purely based off of legal precedent (following *stare decisis*).

This model sees justice behavior as taking into account personal attitudes in order to reach policy goals (and reaffirm the Court's legitimacy/legacy). Early work determined that these models should be viewed entirely separate of each other. Later work showed that looking at the Court through only the legal model would skew toward more 'liberal' decisions while looking only through the attitudinal model would skew toward more 'conservative' decisions. Because of this, most work today studies the Court through a dual model that brings these two models together.

That, of course, does not rule out all discrimination; after all, we discriminate against certain young people by not permitting them to drive.  \n\nTherefore the Court has established a three-tiered test to determine constitutionality of any given discrimination.  \n\n* Tier 1: Strict scrutiny\n* Tier 2: Intermediate scrutiny\n* Tier 3: Rational basis scrutiny\n\nThe different tests have different standards which apply.  For example, under tier 1, the state has the burden to demonstrate that the discriminatory law is passed pursuant to a compelling state interest and that the law is narrowly tailored to that interest.  \n\nEssentially, if the law receives such high scrutiny - it is almost always going to be struck down as unconstitutional.  There are two ways which anti-homosexual-marriage laws could fall under strict scrutiny: 1) By a violation of a fundamental right (right to marry) or 2) the court classifying homosexuals as a protected class.  \n\nThe latter is unlikely, but the former is actually pretty likely.  At the very least, the court MUST apply rational basis test.  This means that the law must be rationally related to a legitimate purpose and the challenger must demonstrate that the law has no legitimate purpose or if one exists, the law is not rationally related to it.  \n\n* This is, at the very least, where homosexual marriage wins the day, in my opinion.  It is very clear that all state laws or constitutional amendments which are against homosexual marriage are based upon irrational traditions or beliefs; since *Lawrence*, it is a highly probable outcome that laws against homosexual marriage will be found unconstitutional.  \n\n----\n\nTo get back to OP's post: \n\n&gt; The states rights argument wouldn't hold up seeing as the 14th amendment would trump it\n\nThis is not accurate at all for several reasons.  First off, the 14th Amendment doesn't trump the 10th Amendment; they must coexist.  \n\nSecond, you're essentially making an flawed supremacy clause argument [stating that federal legislation trumps state legislation].  It is flawed because it is not applicable, that is, there is no conflict of law.  It is not the case that the federal government has said that homosexual marriage is legal and the state has made a law stating a contrary position.  \n\nFinally, if the court determines that it is a legitimate purpose of individual states to regulate the morality of their citizens and banning homosexual marriage is rational under that police power, then states have plenary power to ban homosexual marriage and the 14th Amendment wont \"trump\" it.  \n\n___For reasons I stated earlier, this is extremely unlikely (because I don't see a line up on the Court to overturn *Lawrence*.)___  ",

are two cases before the Supreme Court right now.\n\nFirst is about DOMA, in which the question is: can the federal government define marriage as between a man and a woman for the purpose of federal marriage benefits and in doing so refuse to extend marriage benefits to gay couples who *states* consider to be legally married?\n\nSecond is about Prop 8, in which California's voters changed the California Constitution to define marriage as between a man and a woman, without changing any of the legal and financial benefits offered by California to gay couples through civil unions. So here, the question is, may a state vote to remove the definition/designation of \"marriage\" if doing so would not change the benefits offered to gay couples?\n\nI could imagine a world in which both cases get decided in favor of gay marriage (striking down both DOMA and Prop 8) without actually declaring that gay marriage is the law of the land in the United States. The DOMA ruling would be that the federal government cannot overrule the state's definition of marriage in an area of law that is traditionally left to the states; the Prop 8 ruling would be that, once the designation of \"marriage\" has been extended to gay couples, states may not constitutionally remove it (relying on an older case called *Romer v. Evans*).\n\nAlternatively, a heavily \"states rights\" ruling would likely strike down DOMA (federal government can't overrule states) but uphold Prop 8 (if state voters decide to term some relationships \"marriages\" and some things \"civil unions\" they may do so).\n\nI personally think that one of those two options are the most likely. There is a possibility that the Court strikes down Prop 8 in a way that is broad enough to say \"gay marriage is the law of the land,\" which some view as possible if Justice Kennedy believes that writing such an opinion would help bolster his legacy on the Court, but I would be surprised if Kennedy really swung for the fences on this one. However, I think that is a more likely outcome than the alternative, in which Kennedy votes to uphold both DOMA and Prop 8 (because doing so would put Kennedy very much on the wrong side of history).\n\nAnd to directly engage your Prop 8 question about how to square the states-rights argument with the Fourteenth Amendment... If the law is subjected to rational basis scrutiny, as described elsewhere in this thread by visavismeyou, the Court would be imposing very light scrutiny on Prop 8. They would be deciding whether there was a rational relationship between the law and a legitimate state interest. Laws are very, very rarely stricken down if subjected to rational basis review, because courts are supposed to stretch to uphold the law - they really mean only a **rational** relationship (even if it's bad policy) and **any** legitimate state interest.\n\nIn this case, the argument made by Prop 8 defenders is:\n\n1) There is a legitimate state interest in promoting stable households for childrens' upbringing. (This legitimate state interest is not controversial at all - it may even pass the \"compelling state interest\" test in strict scrutiny)\n\n2) By limiting the word \"marriage\" to relationships between a man and a woman, we preserve a link in society's consciousness between marriage and procreation. By extending the designation of \"marriage\" to gay couples, the definition would be more focused on a union between two people than on the creation of a stable environment for procreation. The best spin I can put on this argument is that if we as a society believe that the primary purpose of marriage is to engage in a union with someone we love, rather than provide a stable household for our offspring, we are more likely to, e.g., get divorced when that union isn't working out than we otherwise would be, thus contributing to more instability in child-rearing.
