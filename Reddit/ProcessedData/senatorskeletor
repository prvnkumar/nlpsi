One side says \"what happened fits within this law,\" and the court says yes or no, and that decides the dispute. \n\nMore rarely, courts have to interpret the law.  A classic law-school example is a town ordinance that says \"No vehicles in the park.\"  OK, no cars.  What about bikes?  What about skateboards?  What about wheelchairs?  So courts interpret the law to make decisions.  (Usually, courts can look to previous opinions which have interpreted the same law as applied to similar cases.)\n\nFinally, on rare occasions, laws themselves are struck down because they violate a higher law, usually the state or federal constitution.  If my state passes a law that says \"no criticism of the governor,\" and I get arrested for criticizing the governor, I can say in my defense that it's an unconstitutional law.  I gather this is what the NJ Supreme Court did.  I don't know the particulars of the case, but let's say that there's a provision in the NJ constitution (like the federal constitution) that says everyone gets equal protection under the law.  A gay couple may have sued the state, arguing that they're not getting equal protection of the state's laws because they can't get married while straight couples can.  (There are cases where states can differentiate between different classes of people, but they need a good reason.)\n\nThe latter two paragraphs both affect policy, and no one reasonably denies it.

The fair way to asses the program is to compare cost of tax compliance with and without Medicare; this includes FICA taxes, as they are part of Medicare.  This difference is the only thing that can be assigned to administrative costs for Medicare.  The fact is that the tax code would be just as complicated whether or not Medicare exists, and would cost the same to comply with.

We're talking about how efficient Medicare is and their administrative costs.  You somehow want to include in their administrative overhead 20% of the cost of complying with the entire tax code, almost all of which has nothing to do with Medicare and FICA taxes (certainly not 20%).  With or without Medicare, those tax compliance costs would exist.  You're applying a political argument to an accounting one.  It's about as intellectually dishonest as it gets.\n\n&gt; so when you leave out lots of the cost, costs are really low? amazing!\n\nWhen you leave out the administrative costs and inefficiencies generated by the private plans in Medicare, and just analyze the public plans, yes, costs get low.  It's almost as this is because the private plans are less efficient.  Gasp!\n\n&gt; um, what? 110 billion out of 800 is about 14%.\n\n1.5-2% overhead is $12-16 billion, plus $60 billion in fraud is $72-76 billion is 9.0-9.5%.  This is the overhead of the public plan (I believe Medicare Part A and maybe B).\n\n&gt; it is as likely that the 60 billion is an underestimate as an overestimate. the senate finance committee[1] says between 20 and 100 billion.\n\nIs that the range that one report found, or the range over a bunch of different reports?  It sounds like the latter, in which cause you cannot assume that represents some confidence interval where $60 billion is the median.  The fact is, from what I've seen, there is little rigor in the analysis behind these numbers, mostly based on assumptions.\n\n*Edit: To point, you claim the range of fraud in Medicare is 20 to 100 billion, while the FBI reported there is only 80 billion in total medical fraud a year.  There's barely any accuracy to these numbers, making any cross report comparisons meaningless (i.e. 60 billion vs 80 billion total).*\n\n&gt; no it isn't. the private companies in medicare advantage still have the burden of collections.\n\nWe've been over this, collections from the IRS are included in Medicare's administrative costs, so it'd still be an accurate comparison.\n\n&gt; Medicare advantage has all the disadvantages of traditional medicare PLUS those of private insurers. no wonder it is inefficient.\n\nIt actually operates fairly identically to the public part of Medicare.  If you'd actually read this [paper](http://institute.ourfuture.org/files/Jacob_Hacker_Public_Plan_Choice.pdf) I keep citing:\n\n&gt; However, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has \nfound that administrative costs under the public Medicare plan are less than 2 percent of \nexpenditures, compared with approximately 11 percent of spending by private plans under \nMedicare Advantage.16 This is a near perfect \u201capples to apples\u201d comparison of \nadministrative costs, because the public Medicare plan and Medicare Advantage plans are \noperating under similar rules and treating the same population.\n \n&gt; (And even these numbers may unduly favor private plans: A recent General \nAccounting Office report found that in 2006 Medicare Advantage plans spent 83.3 percent \nof their revenue on medical expenses, with 10.1 percent going to non-medical expenses and \n6.6 percent to profits\u2014a 16.7 percent administrative share.)17\n\nThey're as close as a comparisons as you're going to get, and the public plans have around 2% overhead compared to 11-16.7% that private plans have.  \n\n&gt; i made a small mistake in my math. that is all. You, by contrast, continue to deny legal reality because it suits your ideology to do so.\n\nYou have consistently gotten even the most basic of facts wrong, and even when faced with the data to prove you wrong, you just bury your head in the sand.  And the fact that you think a semantic political definition somehow alters reality is mind boggling.\n\nI challenge you this: on actual logical merits, argue for me why tax code compliance costs that are *completely* unrelated to how Medicare operates, should somehow be included in their administrative costs?

Just laughable.  Somehow the fact that the US tax code is riddled with exemptions and loopholes requiring higher compliance costs is somehow supposed to be counted towards Medicare overhead?  Please.  If you were being intellectually honest at all you'd see how pathetic this argument is.  Until you can show how much cost tax compliance with FICA is, you don't have an argument.\n\n&gt; medicare/caid's administrative costs are usually cited at 6%. \n\nThose figures that cite 6% either include the private plans in Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D, or were unaware that cost collection from the IRS and other services are included in the original figures, and thus double count when \"recalculating\".  When looking at just the public plans, as reported in the trustees report, you get [closer to around 1.5-2.0%](http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Mcare-admin.jpg).\n\n&gt; then we should count that as part of administrative expenses, not care. so instead of spending 750 billion on healthcare and 50 on admin, they spend 110 billion on admin and spend 690 on healthcare. that's an admin ratio of 16% right there.\n\nAfter all this discussion and you don't even know how administrative costs are calculated? They're done as a percent of total expenditure, as can be seen in almost any graph, article or paper that discusses this issue.  It was even directly laid out in the heritage article you posted, do you not read your own sources?\n\nFixing these two glaringly inaccurate parts, you get to around 9.0-9.5% overhead, still less than the 12-17% reported for private insurance.  And this is making the most generous assumptions one can, i.e. that the $60 billion figure is accurate and not an overestimate and that private insurance has $0 fraud.\n\n&gt; then you have to add the cost of tax compliance on top of that. \n\nWhich you've yet to show is a large burden at all, or how it compares with the burden compliance with private insurance costs.  Until you can produce reliable figures citing this, this argument is bunk.\n\n&gt; Of course, then there is the further issue of patient pools. medicare beneficiaries consume much more healthcare than everyone else, because they are old. if you look at admin costs per patient, instead of per healthcare dollar, medicare is worse than private companies.\n\nIf this were true than you'd expect to see the private plans in Medicare have about the same administrative costs, but they don't.  As shown above and repeated often, [Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D have around 11% overhead verses the 2% that the public Medicare plan has](http://institute.ourfuture.org/files/Jacob_Hacker_Public_Plan_Choice.pdf).

Just laughable.  Somehow the fact that the US tax code is riddled with exemptions and loopholes requiring higher compliance costs is somehow supposed to be counted towards Medicare overhead?  Please.  If you were being intellectually honest at all you'd see how pathetic this argument is.  Until you can show how much cost tax compliance with FICA is, you don't have an argument.\n\n&gt; medicare/caid's administrative costs are usually cited at 6%. \n\nThose figures that cite 6% either include the private plans in Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D, or were unaware that cost collection from the IRS and other services are included in the original figures, and thus double count when \"recalculating\".  When looking at just the public plans, as reported in the trustees report, you get [closer to around 1.5-2.0%](http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Mcare-admin.jpg).\n\n&gt; then we should count that as part of administrative expenses, not care. so instead of spending 750 billion on healthcare and 50 on admin, they spend 110 billion on admin and spend 690 on healthcare. that's an admin ratio of 16% right there.\n\nAfter all this discussion and you don't even know how administrative costs are calculated? They're done as a percent of total expenditure, as can be seen in almost any graph, article or paper that discusses this issue.

And this is making the most generous assumptions one can, i.e. that the $60 billion figure is accurate and not an overestimate and that private insurance has $0 fraud.\n\n&gt; then you have to add the cost of tax compliance on top of that. \n\nWhich you've yet to show is a large burden at all, or how it compares with the burden compliance with private insurance costs.  Until you can produce reliable figures citing this, this argument is bunk.\n\n&gt; Of course, then there is the further issue of patient pools. medicare beneficiaries consume much more healthcare than everyone else, because they are old. if you look at admin costs per patient, instead of per healthcare dollar, medicare is worse than private companies.\n\nIf this were true than you'd expect to see the private plans in Medicare have about the same administrative costs, but they don't.

FICA currently *does* provide funds for Medicare, and the tax compliance for FICA is very very low.\n\n&gt; but since the government needs to raise money somehow, and that creates real costs, any analysis of medicare's costs need to include the cost of taxation. Since none of the taxes are legally linked to medicare, the only fair way to assess the program is looking at its share of total costs of tax collection.\n\nNo, that's almost the most unfair way to assess the program.  The fair way to asses the program is to compare cost of tax compliance with and without Medicare; this includes FICA taxes, as they are part of Medicare.  This difference is the only thing that can be assigned to administrative costs for Medicare.

We're talking about how efficient Medicare is and their administrative costs.  You somehow want to include in their administrative overhead 20% of the cost of complying with the entire tax code, almost all of which has nothing to do with Medicare and FICA taxes (certainly not 20%).  With or without Medicare, those tax compliance costs would exist.  You're applying a political argument to an accounting one.  It's about as intellectually dishonest as it gets.\n\n&gt; so when you leave out lots of the cost, costs are really low? amazing!\n\nWhen you leave out the administrative costs and inefficiencies generated by the private plans in Medicare, and just analyze the public plans, yes, costs get low.  It's almost as this is because the private plans are less efficient.  Gasp!\n\n&gt; um, what? 110 billion out of 800 is about 14%.\n\n1.5-2% overhead is $12-16 billion, plus $60 billion in fraud is $72-76 billion is 9.0-9.5%.  This is the overhead of the public plan (I believe Medicare Part A and maybe B).\n\n&gt; it is as likely that the 60 billion is an underestimate as an overestimate. the senate finance committee[1] says between 20 and 100 billion.\n\nIs that the range that one report found, or the range over a bunch of different reports?  It sounds like the latter, in which cause you cannot assume that represents some confidence interval where $60 billion is the median.  The fact is, from what I've seen, there is little rigor in the analysis behind these numbers, mostly based on assumptions.\n\n*Edit: To point, you claim the range of fraud in Medicare is 20 to 100 billion, while the FBI reported there is only 80 billion in total medical fraud a year.  There's barely any accuracy to these numbers, making any cross report comparisons meaningless (i.e. 60 billion vs 80 billion total).*\n\n&gt; no it isn't. the private companies in medicare advantage still have the burden of collections.\n\nWe've been over this, collections from the IRS are included in Medicare's administrative costs, so it'd still be an accurate comparison.\n\n&gt; Medicare advantage has all the disadvantages of traditional medicare PLUS those of private insurers. no wonder it is inefficient.\n\nIt actually operates fairly identically to the public part of Medicare.  If you'd actually read this [paper](http://institute.ourfuture.org/files/Jacob_Hacker_Public_Plan_Choice.pdf) I keep citing:\n\n&gt; However, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has \nfound that administrative costs under the public Medicare plan are less than 2 percent of \nexpenditures, compared with approximately 11 percent of spending by private plans under \nMedicare Advantage.16 This is a near perfect \u201capples to apples\u201d comparison of \nadministrative costs, because the public Medicare plan and Medicare Advantage plans are \noperating under similar rules and treating the same population.\n \n&gt; (And even these numbers may unduly favor private plans: A recent General \nAccounting Office report found that in 2006 Medicare Advantage plans spent 83.3 percent \nof their revenue on medical expenses, with 10.1 percent going to non-medical expenses and \n6.6 percent to profits\u2014a 16.7 percent administrative share.)17\n\nThey're as close as a comparisons as you're going to get, and the public plans have around 2% overhead compared to 11-16.7% that private plans have.  \n\n&gt; i made a small mistake in my math. that is all. You, by contrast, continue to deny legal reality because it suits your ideology to do so.\n\nYou have consistently gotten even the most basic of facts wrong, and even when faced with the data to prove you wrong, you just bury your head in the sand.  And the fact that you think a semantic political definition somehow alters reality is mind boggling.\n\nI challenge you this: on actual logical merits, argue for me why tax code compliance costs that are *completely* unrelated to how Medicare operates, should somehow be included in their administrative costs?

Just laughable.  Somehow the fact that the US tax code is riddled with exemptions and loopholes requiring higher compliance costs is somehow supposed to be counted towards Medicare overhead?  Please.  If you were being intellectually honest at all you'd see how pathetic this argument is.  Until you can show how much cost tax compliance with FICA is, you don't have an argument.\n\n&gt; medicare/caid's administrative costs are usually cited at 6%. \n\nThose figures that cite 6% either include the private plans in Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D, or were unaware that cost collection from the IRS and other services are included in the original figures, and thus double count when \"recalculating\".  When looking at just the public plans, as reported in the trustees report, you get [closer to around 1.5-2.0%](http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Mcare-admin.jpg).\n\n&gt; then we should count that as part of administrative expenses, not care. so instead of spending 750 billion on healthcare and 50 on admin, they spend 110 billion on admin and spend 690 on healthcare. that's an admin ratio of 16% right there.\n\nAfter all this discussion and you don't even know how administrative costs are calculated? They're done as a percent of total expenditure, as can be seen in almost any graph, article or paper that discusses this issue.  It was even directly laid out in the heritage article you posted, do you not read your own sources?\n\nFixing these two glaringly inaccurate parts, you get to around 9.0-9.5% overhead, still less than the 12-17% reported for private insurance.  And this is making the most generous assumptions one can, i.e. that the $60 billion figure is accurate and not an overestimate and that private insurance has $0 fraud.\n\n&gt; then you have to add the cost of tax compliance on top of that. \n\nWhich you've yet to show is a large burden at all, or how it compares with the burden compliance with private insurance costs.  Until you can produce reliable figures citing this, this argument is bunk.\n\n&gt; Of course, then there is the further issue of patient pools. medicare beneficiaries consume much more healthcare than everyone else, because they are old. if you look at admin costs per patient, instead of per healthcare dollar, medicare is worse than private companies.\n\nIf this were true than you'd expect to see the private plans in Medicare have about the same administrative costs, but they don't.  As shown above and repeated often, [Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D have around 11% overhead verses the 2% that the public Medicare plan has](http://institute.ourfuture.org/files/Jacob_Hacker_Public_Plan_Choice.pdf).

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Force of habit, really.\n\n***New Hampshire*** has had very early primaries for a long time, because during spring primaries the roads would be so muddy that farmers couldn't make it into town to vote.  So New Hampshire decided to hold them before the spring thaw.  I forget when they started (I recall 1912 offhand) but I know there's a set of plaques in Concord that list the recent winners, starting with Estes Kefauver, a senator from Tennessee, in 1952.\n\nIn truth, though, the New Hampshire primary, and primaries in general, had limited impact before 1968.  I know Kennedy dueled Humphrey in a few primaries in 1960, but that was more to show strength than to win delegates.  Most delegates were assigned by party bosses, leading to nominations being decided in the proverbial smoke-filled rooms.  I believe Henry Cabot Lodge won the New Hampshire primary one year without even campaigning, while he was ambassador to Vietnam.\n\nThings started changing in 1968 when LBJ, the sitting president, barely beat anti-war candidate Eugene McCarthy in the New Hampshire primary.  McCarthy's surprising show of strength prompted Bobby Kennedy to join the race about a week later, and LBJ to drop out soon after.  After the 1968 Democratic National Convention was fraught with ugly conflict between party regulars and protesters, a commission headed by Senator George McGovern revised the nomination process to shift power away from party bosses and towards primary voters.\n\nSo it was not a coincidence that the 1972 nomination went to the candidate who best knew the new system, George McGovern.  Along with his campaign manager, Gary Hart (who would almost win the nomination himself twelve years later), McGovern found innovative ways of picking up delegates during the primaries.  One idea was to focus on the ***Iowa*** caucuses, which had been around before but never received any attention.  McGovern correctly realized that if he, as a lesser-known candidate, won the Iowa caucuses, he would receive more attention and hopefully a better share of the vote in later primaries.  The plan worked, and he won the nomination.  Iowa's status as a major step in the nomination process was confirmed four years later, when a governor of Georgia no one had heard of camped out in Iowa, won the caucuses, and became history's greatest monster,^1 Jimmy Carter.\n\nEver since, other states have tried getting in on some of that early-contest action.  Delaware made a strong push in 1996 I think, and Michigan and Florida both tried jumping the line in 2008, but DNC rules punish the delegations of states that go before Iowa or New Hampshire.  New Hampshire even has a state law that the primary has to go seven days before any other primary.  So although other states attempting to cut in front was a quadrennial tradition for decades, Iowa and New Hampshire have remained the first.\n\nSo the trick other states have ended up using is not competing with Iowa or New Hampshire, but coming up with a gimmick of their own.  I honestly don't recall when ***South Carolina*** started using the \"First in the South\" slogan, but I know it was the third contest in 2000, when George W. Bush and John McCain had quite the street fight in South Carolina when it looked like McCain might knock Bush out of the nomination.  (He didn't.)  South Carolina was a major factor in the 2004 Democratic contest as well, and its hold as First in the South seems to have solidified.  (It looks like the Nevada caucuses are solidifying up as \"First in the West\" as well.)\n\nI'm doing this all offhand, so if anyone wants any sources or thinks I may be off on any of the details, please let me know and I'll look into it.\n\n1.

This post will cover your first point.  \n\nOne of the things that really irritated liberals after the fact was that OWS recieved a lot more law enforcement scrutiny than the Tea Party and similar right-wing movements.  We now know that OWS was treated by law enforcement as a potential terrorist organization, and they used spies and infiltrators to try to dismantle the movement from the inside.  I remember at the protests themselves, there was open and very serious talk about \"agent provocateurs\".  \n\n90% of the movement was adamantly non-violent, and any talk about violence was quickly shushed.  It is important to note that non-violent does not mean that we were organized, peaceful, and law abiding.  OWS believed in civil disobediance and therefore causing disruption and breaking the law was a key strategy.  This gave the police an excuse to corral us, and therefore we did not see ourselves aligned with the police.  There were a few people who said that the police should be treated as part of the 99%, in practice we saw police confrontation and an opportunity to win public support and outrage, so we encouraged it.  \n\nDid the strategy succeed?  It is hard to say.  Public support of OWS was significant, over 70%.  Both OWS and the Tea Party were anti-establishment, which is a message that almost all Americans align with; that is why both movements had high approval ratings.  And there was genuine outrage at police actions against OWS.\n\nHowever, it caused two major issues.  Firstly, it gave the opponents of OWS a clear line of attack: OWS is nothing but naive teenage hippies and they just want to cause commotion.  While this talk is annoying to OWS supporters, I don't think it hurt the movement all that much.  The real problem is that the police were successful in practice.  By the winter of 2011, the bulk of protests outside of New York had been ended by police actions, and everyone went home.

This post will cover your second point.\n\nWould the movement have been better served to adopt specific policy goals and a strategy for implementing them? This is a fantastic question.  In short, I think the answer is yes, but we should acknowledge why OWS did not have clear policies.\n\nOWS was an anarchist movement.  While there were many left-wing and anti-establishment groups represented, at its core were anarchist ideologies about how popular movements should be run.  The core of the protest was a consensus based decision circle associated with the infamous (and in my opinion delightful) \"mic check\".\n\nThe way a mic check works was clever and igneous.  The idea is that one person chooses to talk, and the crowd repeats them, like a chant.  In a large, disorganized crowd, it is impossible to have your voice heard without bullhorn.  In a mic check, the crowd acts as a \"human microphone\" and amplifies what the speaker says.  However, once a crowd loses interest in what the speaker has to say, they will stop repeating them, and another person can step in and become the speaker.  This allows a diversity of opinion to be heard without radical voices dominating the discussion.  \n\nUltimately, decisions are made by consensus within this circle.  OWS had founders (such as NoLogo) but no leaders.  This means that in order to make a statement, it must be based on consensus.  Ultimately OWS (the New York protest) did release a statement of principles that emerged from the decision circle, but it was very delayed.  Such is the nature of consensus democracy-- it is slow.  \n\nI do think that OWS would have been more successful if NoLogo et al had *started* with clear principles, and then revised them within the decision circles at protests.  With a clear statement of what OWS was trying to do and what it stood for, it would have been hard to brand them as either naive hippies or as radical communists.  In practice, 90% of OWS were progressive Democrats or Green party, not communists or true anarchist.  The statement of principles would have made it clear that, in terms of clear policy goals, OWS agrees with what 70% of the American public agrees with.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7pu2up", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357153803", "ups": 7, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I was the PR Director for Occupy Portland.\n\n1. Yes, it would have, but doing so was nearly impossible. The Police in the United States are very well trained, in many senses of the word. Fundamentally, people that largely agreed with us within the police had a \"mode\" their minds went into when in action that was not conducive to considering the merits of a Constitutional argument, or an ethical/moral argument, or even if the protest would benefit them. Secondarily, as has become known now and we knew at the time, the Federal government was greatly involved in pushing Police action and oversight of the process, and not many officers are going to think for themselves when the Feds are poking around.\n\n2. Yes, it would have greatly benefited from this. However, the people involved were enormously disenfranchised. This meant that the group was very, very conscious about both being co-opted by hidden forces (of which several attempts were actually made), and of further disenfranchising the people that actually showed up. These were the most frustrated people, and so many, more than affecting real change, just wanted to be *heard*. There were those such as myself within Occupy that were greatly interested in affecting real change of some kind, but most simply needed to be psychologically comforted that they mattered. They felt that there was literally no point to their existence politically, and that was scary.\n\nSo... the biggest thing that OWS could have done different is had a national infrastructure. We tried to organize inter-occupy communication, but it was nearly impossible. National organization of some kind that could be plugged into would have been both understandable on a practical level, and would have forced down some much needed structure into the local Occupys.\n\nEarly on OWS (in New York) tried to do this, but they did it in a very \"our way or the highway\" approach that actually further fractured national organization. They basically took the position that they did it first, so it belonged to them nationally. People might have gone along with that, but their inter-occupy organization was ad-hoc, and not prepared in advance, so any claim that it could only be organized through them felt a bit contrived. In addition, they received many times the donations most other Occupys did, but didn't reinvest that back into infrastructure for national organization, which would have been the only way to: 1. generate further financial contributions and 2. consolidate the power of all the individual Occupy groups into something that could have been effectively wielded.", "id": "t1_c7px97v", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "JordanLeDoux", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_15tzmv", "id": "t1_c7pxkog", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "level1", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Federal agencies don't usually police politics, they police power.

We had moved into this park that day and the park closed at 9PM. We had presented the city with a plan our group had agreed upon for how we would prevent property destruction, how we would deal with those who engaged in it (in cooperation with the city and the police), how we would fund any repairs necessary as a result of our activities, how we would work with the city and the police to provide a safe environment, and a whole host of other issues.\n\nThe police moved in at 8PM, announcing that the park was closed early by emergency order of the city. I attempted to move forward near the line of riot police so that I could talk to the people in charge (who I knew on a first name basis at that point) so that I could learn why the emergency order had been issued and who had issued it.\n\nThey ignored me however and after 15 minutes I gave up and turned to leave. The entire time the police had been directing people over a speaker system to leave the park in a peaceful and orderly fashion. As I turned to comply with this order, which I personally felt was both immoral and illegal I might add, I was hit in the back with a baton. It nearly knocked the wind out of me.\n\nI got back up, livid, and nearly tackled the officer that hit me. But then I saw his nametag and realized that he was hoping I hit him. He wanted to beat me. You see, in our very first altercation with the police, the department had conducted itself admirably. They had made their arrests and executed their orders in a fashion which used no more force than necessary and diffused potential problems... all except one officer. Being the PR director, when I was interviewed by local media after that first incident, I praised the police department for their professionalism, but noted the one officer who had been using force enthusiastically by name.\n\nHe was the one that had hit me, and I could see it in his eyes that he wanted to \"even the score\" with me.\n\nI grew up in a fairly conservative house and always had a fairly favorable opinion of the police.

If they split with their party to support the Democrats, that would be the end of their career for almost any member of the Republican caucus.  It's not just that the Republican House leadership would punish them (fewer appropriations to their district, making sure they move up the ranks as slowly as possible), although they would, but any Republicans who split ranks on so prominent an issue would face a primary challenge from another Republican.  And in the next Republican primary, who are the Republicans going to vote for: the Republican who sold out their values, or the challenger calling them out on it?\n\n1. Even if party loyalty weren't an issue, there aren't enough Republicans who would even want to split with Republicans.  Party polarization has become so stark in recent years that the most liberal Republican is more conservative than the most conservative Democrat.  So there just aren't enough votes in the House for the Democratic version of how to resolve the fiscal cliff.  In other words, virtually all (maybe literally all) House Republicans think the Obama approach is objectively a terrible idea.\n\n2. Politics being a zero-sum game, there's always going to be a disincentive from helping the other party win a major victory.  This is one big reason why Republicans have hesitated to support Obama on traditionally Republican ideas like mandate-based universal health care or cap-and-trade to help slow global warming.  They don't want Obama to be popular enough that he'll pass more Democratic initiatives, so they deny him wins where they can.

In the 2003 State of the Union, President Bush referenced intelligence suggesting that associates of the Iraqi government had attempted to buy yellowcake uranium (for making bombs? I don't know the science) from someone in Nigeria.\n\nSo you or I would look at that and say, hmmmm, troubling, but we need more.  But you and I weren't in the administration, and many members of the George W. Bush administration had long thought that the first Bush administration (i.e. his father) made a terrible mistake in not deposing Saddam Hussein in the first Gulf War in 1991.\n\nSo look at it from their perspective: they honestly believed that Saddam was a Hitler-level bad guy, that we flat-out let him off the hook, and that for ten years he was just sitting there, building up strength, ready to strike the United States at any time.  He did, incidentally, try to assassinate the first President Bush after Bush left office, so it's not like this was all in their heads.\n\nSo then 9/11 hits, and there you have it: after all that time worrying about a terrorist attack from your Mideast enemies, there's a terrorist attack from your Mideast enemies.  These weren't Iraqis, sure, but these were peas in a pod, right?  And honestly, how did we know Saddam *wasn't* behind this?  He had been talking about the evils of America for years.\n\nSo look back at the evidence in that context.  Intelligence hears about this attempt to buy yellowcake uranium, and a few other things too (I recall something about centrifuges).  You've been scared witless of what Saddam could do for years, and it looks like he's done it, and will keep doing it.  You may have made a mistake in 1991, but you're not going to make it again.

They want to be on the right side of history, so they won't uphold both laws.

I don't see any solidly left-wing results coming out of this Court, so they won't strike down both laws.  A good example is the ACA ruling from earlier this year, which as other comments have pointed out upheld Obamacare but at great cost to an expansive reading of the commerce clause.\n\n3. They will err on the side of states' rights, and uphold Prop 8.  If they're going to uphold one law, I'd guess it'd be the one addressing California's rights to set marriage laws, and not the one addressing the federal government's rights to determine marriage benefits.\n\nI hope I'm wrong, and the actual result is a wide-ranging decision that strikes down all anti-marriage laws and constitutional provisions.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_14mg1m", "selftext": "I believe it's largely because the parties have become more polarized.  It used to be the case that there were plenty of liberal (mostly northern) Republicans, and plenty of conservative (mostly southern) Democrats.  So, depending on the makeup of a given Congress, either a liberal or a conservative bill could pass with plenty of bipartisan support.\n\nAlthough the parties have trended towards ideological consistency for decades now, it was only in the past few years that, for the first time, the most liberal Republican was more conservative than the most conservative Democrat.  So what you've seen is a decreasing capacity to find bipartisan support for legislation.\n\nI should add that there are plenty of other potential culprits, and it's hard to say how much each affects bipartisanship.  Off the top of my head, I can think of two more:\n\n1. Members of Congress used to live in DC and only go back to the districts during a recess.  Now Congress will frequently work Tuesday through Thursday, and members spend weekends back home in the districts.  Some have speculated that it was easier to work together on bills and harder to demonize each other when members would see each other socially (at dinner, at kids' Little League games, etc.).\n\n2. The parties have discovered that they do better electorally when they adopt essentially a permanent campaign.  The old line about the Senate is that, in a six-year term, a senator spends two years as a statesman, two years as a politician, and two years as a candidate.  Now, it seems they're at least a politician the entire time.  It's harder for give-and-take negotiations when you're trying to demonize your opponent every single day.\n\nAlso, the Clinton administration wasn't exactly the high-water mark of bipartisanship either.  One of George W. Bush's stump speech lines in 2000 was that, having been Governor of Texas and not in Washington, he had no stake in all the bitter dischord of the Clinton years.  Regardless of who's right in all this, that kind of comment shows that it was taken for granted that Washington in 1999-2000 was coming off years of bitterness.  I think the Clinton era is when the phrase \"the politics of personal destruction\" arose as well.\n\nEDIT: I screwed up \"effects\" and \"affects\" and deserve public shaming.", "id": "t1_c7eh5kw", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "senatorskeletor", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_14mg1m", "score": 10, "retrieved_on": 1430636673, "controversiality": 0, "edited": 1355243535, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7eh5kw", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1355180050", "ups": 10, "distinguished": null}
