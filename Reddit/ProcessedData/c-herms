{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "You'd have to be more specific than simply \"parliamentary election\", as there are actually a wide variety of different parliamentary electoral systems for which the answer will vary. To answer your question in favor of voting for the party, let's take a look at a proportional representation (PR) electoral system. In a PR system, there exist a certain number of seats in parliament for which the various parties compete. The parties win how ever many seats as the proportion of the vote they received. For example, if there are 100 seats up for election, and Party A wins 30% of the vote, then Party A will receive 30 seats. \n\n\nThe candidates, therefore, are elected indirectly through either a closed-list or an open-list. In a closed-list election (i.e. Russia, South Africa), there is a predefined list of ranked candidates that are chosen by the party. When Party A wins its 30 seats, it works its way down the ranked list, assigning seats to the top 30 candidates.\n\nIn an open-list election (i.e. Sweden, Finland), voters are able to mark the ballot for whichever individual candidates they choose. However, the votes are collectively redistributed to the party, and the number of seats are still granted to the party based on the proportion of the vote they received. When Party A wins 30 seats, those seats are then assigned to whichever thirty candidates received the most votes. \n\nThere are then variations on this system such as semi-proportional representation which I can explain further if anyone is interested.", "id": "t1_cbrbhyl", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "c-herms", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_cbre06n", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "FugitiveDribbling", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "Indeed.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I would say that NATO members probably don't see much value in having Mexico as a NATO member.\n\nTo understand NATO, we need to first look at its origins as a treaty organization. Founded in 1949, it was very much a western response to the growing security dilemma presented by the expanding Communist Bloc. The United States was naturally the hedgemon of the agreement, being the western superpower in the bipolar international system of the time. The true beginning of NATO was the Treaty of Brussels (1948), which included the United States and several of its closest allies such as the UK and France, and later expanded to include other states that could enhance NATO force projection potential eastward, thus giving NATO a security advantage over the USSR. Mexico was likely never invited to join NATO, because an economically underdeveloped nation a world away from the USSR wouldn't have much of anything to contribute to increasing the security of Western Europe and the USA/Canada. \n\nNATO's mission has largely changed since the end of the Cold War, as it is now focused on protecting western interests and security in the Middle East and Africa. International treaties of this scale are subject to large collective goods problems, basically meaning that its easy for smaller states to free-ride on the benefits provided to the alliance by bigger states. Member states want to minimize collective goods problems, meaning that they will only invite states to join if they will either pull their weight in the operations of the organization or provide some sort of strategic advantage to the collective organization that makes any lack of contribution permissible. Mexico provides neither, as they would have to take far more military aid than they could contribute, and their geographic location would give NATO no strategic advantage to their current mission. Therefore, if the United States, which is the primary financier of NATO anyway, wanted to increase military aid to Mexico, it would do it on its own. Inviting them to join NATO would just be an unnecessary step that would be counterproductive to the mission of NATO as a whole.

That's not really the question though, because \"using up political credit\" does not mean displeasing two people on reddit, so let's analyze it more objectively.\n\nFirst of all, Obama is a lame duck president, which means his \"political credit\" matters much less now than it did four months ago. From a political standpoint, his only concern is ensuring that the democrats win again in future elections. So, is Obama's current stance on guns helping or hurting that endeavor?\n\nFor one, is the idea of stricter gun control really unpopular in the United States? [Several recent national polls](http://www.pollingreport.com/guns.htm) show that a majority of Americans actually do favor stricter gun control of some sort, including bans on assault weapons and high capacity magazines. Also, let's think about where, geographically, guns are popular and where they aren't. People who favor gun rights typically come from more rural areas, while people who favor gun control typically come from more urban areas. Democrats tend to be more popular in urban areas and less popular in rural areas, and because urban areas have far more electoral votes than rural areas, it makes a lot of sense for the democrats to try to please urban populaces. Likewise, passing strict gun control legislation will upset the rural populaces, but those are areas where democrats will more than likely lose in the polls anyway, so the cost there does not outweigh the gains in urban areas. \n\nIf the democrats are able to pass stricter gun control legislation, some people say that would be a huge mistake politically, but I predict otherwise. I imagine that gun control legislation, regardless of whether or not it's actually effective, may be one of the most intelligent political decisions the democrats can make right now.", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "&gt;First of all, Obama is a lame duck president, \n\nObama isn't a lame duck president, that term is usually reserved for an elected official who is approaching the end of his/her and isn't seeking re-election (be it by choice of by law).

Gun owners are living in a dream world if they think an event like Newtown can happen and for their to be no response. Yes I realize \"assault weapons\" is a nebulous term, that relatively few people are killed by the weapons used by Jeremy Holmes and Adam Lanza, and massacres in general are rare. Still at the end of the day you can't expect the political response to a school massacre to be indifference, the voting public, particularly on the democratic side, demands a response.\n\nFurther it is complicated to say rather Obama is \"using up his political capital.\" Among republicans and democrats in more conservative districts, yes definitely (though he seems to have very little political capital with republicans anyways), but among more liberal/urban democrats he is definitely gaining political capital. Passing some sort of major gun reform would help energize democrats and independents who favor gun control. \n\nIf Obama and the democrats are able to push through a significant gun control bill than over all they will have increased their political capital because most Americans want some sort gun control and it also shows competence/follow through on Obama's part.

They can make some parts of the work much easier, for example, filling in the tedious details while the architect directs the process.. \n\nBut, I would be lying if I did not admit that there is a very real process of devaluation of any static skill over time.. The bar is continually rising, very quickly and anybody who stats still for too long risks being put out of the game so to speak..\n\nHowever, all the architects that I know are really passionate about computers and computing..\n\nOf course all engineers are familiar with various kinds of CAD software some of it quite sophisticated.. Another huge area is computer visualization, an area I have always been interested in.\n\nTechnology's huge gift to creative folk is tempered by the fact that it democratizes the arts by making the cost of entry much lower.. \n\nEverybody isn't an architect, but software makes it much easier to be a amateur and a good one.\n\nAnyway, here I find myself with the opportunity to write something very - how can I put it, multifacteted about technology. But I'm sleepy and I'm just not up to it as I would like to be..\n\nWe should not fear technology - Technology could transform our society in very good ways..\n\nBut, then i think of my architect friend C. who cant get work doing architecture (which she loves) because there simply isn't much of a demand for it unless you're well known, however for years she was paying her rent doing Autocad for other architects.. But last i spoke with her she was getting disgusted with that because she says that the clients she has recently got dont care about quality and are nickel and diming her on her rates.. Lots of people know Autocad now, and she feels, not many clients really appreciate quality. I don't know how it is now, it might be better, that was a few years ago..\n\nPro photographers bitch about digital photography a lot (even as they use it all the time)\n\nBut, I guess architecture is a good example of an area where practitioners have to keep moving or their skills become worth less and less by staying in the same place... All technical skillsets are like that.\n\nThe gradual evolution of parametrically driven software that can take a set of design specifications and work with it to output a completed building plan and bill of materials as well as sequential instructions for its assembly could be a boon or a threat, it will effect the entire spread of a field from top to bottom... \n\nThis area a very very interesting one and of course it is and will be and will eternally be solved over and over in very interesting ways. One of the most interesting I think is generative art..\n\nMy first exposure to generative art was when I quite young  when I first heard brian eno's music for airports.. which is rules based generative music..  \n\nPeople rarely realize this but computers only with much coaxing can produce anything truly random..\n\nBut generative art requires a random seed.. entropy..\n\ntypically a \"seed\" is used that is used to make a series of art pieces that are generated randomly and the user selects the subset of the generated pieces that appeal to the user for any reason whatsoever, then the computer generates another set more like the ones picked, each successive iteration in theory the output will be closer to the unverbalized desires of the user. In a sense its a bit like a random toss of the dice but this technique can be quite well developed and ultimately it is a very productive space - the artist and the machine working together to create originality. Ive actually done works of \"architecture\" using generative art using programs that I have which produce 3D \"minimal surfaces\" and then mapping the 3D shapes produced into imaginary buildings. I would have to dig through my old stuff to find them but they were quite beautiful!\n\nActually, the world of mathematics has a great many shapes which can be translated into architectural structures that have enormous appeal for many reasons. One of my favorites is the [tensegrity mast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kenneth_Snelson_Needle_Tower.JPG) which is a very strong structure that can be erected vertically with very little in the way of equipment. (pipes and cable) \n\nI suspect that its not as difficult as it sounds to write a piece of software that lets you say- design software to generate plans for a building that say, always can withstand  wind of x, and support y kilos, contains a mens room and a ladies room, always contains electrical outlets at x number of feet apart, always includes some minimum of windows in a room, except for a closet, and so on.\n\nI use software to create PC boards that has similar kinds of processes going on. There isn't much of  difference in certain ways between an architecture program and a PCB design that creates a multitude of different kinds of files which can be sent to a PC board fab that tell them what to put on each side of the boards, where to drill the vias, auto routes traces, and so on.\n\nI'll answer the others a bit later when I have more time.", "id": "t1_c8fa3lv", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "But architecture is as much about aesthetics as it is about functionality, and that's where a computer program would fall short.

The real danger *as well as beauty* I think for humanity is the fact that in the final analysis these things are at their core, tools, but incredibly sophisticated ones. They can make some parts of the work much easier, for example, filling in the tedious details while the architect directs the process.. \n\nBut, I would be lying if I did not admit that there is a very real process of devaluation of any static skill over time.. The bar is continually rising, very quickly and anybody who stats still for too long risks being put out of the game so to speak..\n\nHowever, all the architects that I know are really passionate about computers and computing..\n\nOf course all engineers are familiar with various kinds of CAD software some of it quite sophisticated.. Another huge area is computer visualization, an area I have always been interested in.\n\nTechnology's huge gift to creative folk is tempered by the fact that it democratizes the arts by making the cost of entry much lower.. \n\nEverybody isn't an architect, but software makes it much easier to be a amateur and a good one.\n\nAnyway, here I find myself with the opportunity to write something very - how can I put it, multifacteted about technology. But I'm sleepy and I'm just not up to it as I would like to be..\n\nWe should not fear technology - Technology could transform our society in very good ways..\n\nBut, then i think of my architect friend C. who cant get work doing architecture (which she loves) because there simply isn't much of a demand for it unless you're well known, however for years she was paying her rent doing Autocad for other architects.. But last i spoke with her she was getting disgusted with that because she says that the clients she has recently got dont care about quality and are nickel and diming her on her rates.. Lots of people know Autocad now, and she feels, not many clients really appreciate quality. I don't know how it is now, it might be better, that was a few years ago..\n\nPro photographers bitch about digital photography a lot (even as they use it all the time)\n\nBut, I guess architecture is a good example of an area where practitioners have to keep moving or their skills become worth less and less by staying in the same place... All technical skillsets are like that.\n\nThe gradual evolution of parametrically driven software that can take a set of design specifications and work with it to output a completed building plan and bill of materials as well as sequential instructions for its assembly could be a boon or a threat, it will effect the entire spread of a field from top to bottom... \n\nThis area a very very interesting one and of course it is and will be and will eternally be solved over and over in very interesting ways. One of the most interesting I think is generative art..\n\nMy first exposure to generative art was when I quite young  when I first heard brian eno's music for airports.. which is rules based generative music..  \n\nPeople rarely realize this but computers only with much coaxing can produce anything truly random..\n\nBut generative art requires a random seed.. entropy..\n\ntypically a \"seed\" is used that is used to make a series of art pieces that are generated randomly and the user selects the subset of the generated pieces that appeal to the user for any reason whatsoever, then the computer generates another set more like the ones picked, each successive iteration in theory the output will be closer to the unverbalized desires of the user. In a sense its a bit like a random toss of the dice but this technique can be quite well developed and ultimately it is a very productive space - the artist and the machine working together to create originality. Ive actually done works of \"architecture\" using generative art using programs that I have which produce 3D \"minimal surfaces\" and then mapping the 3D shapes produced into imaginary buildings. I would have to dig through my old stuff to find them but they were quite beautiful!\n\nActually, the world of mathematics has a great many shapes which can be translated into architectural structures that have enormous appeal for many reasons. One of my favorites is the [tensegrity mast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kenneth_Snelson_Needle_Tower.JPG) which is a very strong structure that can be erected vertically with very little in the way of equipment. (pipes and cable) \n\nI suspect that its not as difficult as it sounds to write a piece of software that lets you say- design software to generate plans for a building that say, always can withstand  wind of x, and support y kilos, contains a mens room and a ladies room, always contains electrical outlets at x number of feet apart, always includes some minimum of windows in a room, except for a closet, and so on.\n\nI use software to create PC boards that has similar kinds of processes going on. There isn't much of  difference in certain ways between an architecture program and a PCB design that creates a multitude of different kinds of files which can be sent to a PC board fab that tell them what to put on each side of the boards, where to drill the vias, auto routes traces, and so on.\n\nI'll answer the others a bit later when I have more time.", "id": "t1_c8fa3lv", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "christ0ph", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "But architecture is as much about aesthetics as it is about functionality, and that's where a computer program would fall short.

North Korea is very small, and the location of its existing military installations are very well known by US military intelligence. It could destroy anything that poses a threat to Seoul in a matter of minutes after the commencement of a surprise air attack and could also quickly quell any attempts at setting up more artillery to attack Seoul (which I doubt would be the main priority of the North Korean army during a massive surprise attack by the US). The US would then, of course, have to occupy the country through a ground invasion to finish the job, which would take longer and be costlier.\n\nAlso, China would not fight the US in a war over North Korea. Fifty years ago, sure, but certainly not anymore. China doesn't really like North Korea, and its relevance as a \"buffer state\" has been quickly waning since the end of the cold war. In fact, nuclear armed North Korea might be a larger threat to China than it is the the US. If the US were to invade North Korea, China would most likely sit back, because it wouldn't be worth it to them to sacrifice trade with the largest consumer of Chinese goods in the world.\n\nSo, why doesn't the US do this then? A couple of reasons, the biggest being that the US learned its lesson about mounting an invasion against another country just because they make some hollow threats against after the Iraq war. North Korea isn't *really* a threat to the US, and they know very well exactly what would happen if they used a nuclear weapon against the US or anyone else.

Southern Strategy and bam one of the most popular presidents in history and father of the modern Republican party. That should be enough to google for a while.

Over time, the US would have elected officials from many different parties all serving in gov't at the same time.", "id": "t1_c7z9epe", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "c-herms", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_16slhp", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431003941, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7z9epe", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1358529759", "ups": 1, "distinguished": null}

The second is that the Netherlands is part of the EU, and the rest of the EU would likely have to take the side of one of its member states in an armed conflict. This is especially true in this instance, because the ICC is funded more by the EU than all other countries in the world combined.\n\nSo, it's clear that an incident like this would make a lot of nations around the world, particularly European nations, very upset, but what does this mean from a practical standpoint? It's tough to really say for sure, because international relations can be very unpredictable when faced with an event unique to anything seen before, but we can still speculate. For one, while it is likely limited armed exchange would occur during the initial invasion, I don't think you would see an escalation to full scale war. The EU simply wouldn't be powerful enough to face the US in a full war, and the US wouldn't find full war optimal either. It would, however, be the end of NATO and any other formal alliance between the US and EU states.

Having a strong military isn't necessarily a good defense against terrorism either, because terrorism is specifically an asymmetric warfare tactic designed to be used against a much more powerful enemy force.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money the US allocates to its military isn't entirely necessary to defend itself, and it could get away with a much smaller defense budget and not see any notable increase in its risk of being attacked or any notable decrease in its ability to handle such an attack.", "id": "t1_c7r3ywe", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "c-herms", "children": [], "parent_id": "t3_15yvj9", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1430857459, "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c7r3ywe", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1357335048", "ups": 2, "distinguished": null}

Or at least too much in the wrong direction and not enough in the right direction. Terrorism is an unusual breed of warfare, because it is invisible, asymmetric, and intangible. You can kill a terrorist, but doing so is counterproductive, because he will be hailed a martyr, hatred of the western world will grow, and more will join up to take his place. \n\nThe key purpose behind terrorism is not to kill. That is merely incidental. The purpose is to change policy, and it does so very effectively. US congress can't even agree on who to get to cater a meeting, but the moment 9/11 happened, a lot of new policies were passed very very quickly. These are policies that have forever negatively changed the way Americans functions in their daily lives. That is precisely what the terrorist wanted to happen, and it has done little to combat an ideology which continues to further its grasp on the Middle East.\n\nSo, what should the western world do if it wants to truly combat terrorism? Stop pouring gasoline on the fire. Stop letting it change policy. Stop invading countries in an effort to kill an idea. Stop running around with our hair on fire afraid of something that we cannot see and do not understand. If we no longer fear the terrorists, their method of warfare will become ineffective, and it will no longer be worth it for them to use such tactics.
