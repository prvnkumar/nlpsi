It turns out they can't, and some of the problems in the U.S. right now are caused by this bunch of morons doing what they think is right.\n\nPS: If you do study American politics for a living, how can you say no voters are racist?", "id": "t1_ccktlf2", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Aethec", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_ccktmqw", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "kgb_agent_zhivago", "children": [], "parent_id": "t1_ccktlf2", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1429249270, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Oh, of course some voters are racist.

The capitalist model doesn't allow for social welfare and many societal benefits that the business community supports have a profit margin or monetary advantage attached to it. \n\n&gt;Ever looked at the amount of funding that is spent on the poor? And how its grown in the last 70 years?\n\nIt's really a nominal amount compared to spending in other sectors of the economy, like the military, which is a profit driver for the economy anyway. That's a poor argument. Federal aid to the poor is a joke anyway because it's constantly under attack by some members of Congress. And the business community doesn't particularly concern itself with poverty because it's not a profit driver. Of course there are PR stunts to \"show they care\", but they're nothing amazing. The US government should be more helpful for people with less privilege, but since both parties heavily represent the interests of elite citizens and persons, that doesn't happen. \n\nYou don't think there is a moral problem with punishing customers and workers when corporations are mandated by federal law to do certain things for their employees? I understand the loss of profit perfectly well, but that still doesn't affect most people, only the ones who have an investment stake in the company. It affects the net gain of wealth for mostly already wealthy people. The money very rarely\u2014and at low levels\u2014ever goes back into communities and for the public good. It's all privatized, which historically disenfranchises more people than not. Just look at what happened to labor unions through the 70s and 80s. When corporations are no longer beholden to their labor force, they aren't obligated to do jack shit. So we have  stagnating wages and poor conditions. I think it's especially important for people who work for corporations and aren't office professionals to have maternity laws passed and enforced. Most women and men in this country cannot afford to have a child and continue to work, or take unpaid time off to raise the child through infancy. Think about the late-twenty something married couple that lives in poverty and has a child on the way.

And then we also complain when it doesn't lay eggs.  Be honest and simply say \"we're going to ask the young to offset the additional cost that the elderly are paying\" and be done with it.\n\nIn my mind, we really need to have three \"levels\" of health programs in the country.  The first needs to be your typical routine care that *should not* be paid by insurance.  Physicals, etc.  These are small dollar, very likely events.  By insurance's nature, these are not the type to cover.  We can debate whether preventative care should be in this group or not - and while we're add it, lets admit that much of the \"preventative\" care we talk about is not really preventative - its detective.  Having a mammogram is *not* going to stop you from developing breast cancer.  It will *detect* it.\n\nSecond we would have the insurance layer.  This is for otherwise healthy people who just need coverage for when they do something stupid or have bad luck.  You know, high-cost, low risk items that insurance works perfectly to cover.\n\nThird we would have the \"chronic\" layer.  High-cost, high-risk items that insurance cannot cover but we also do not want to allow to simply suffer (or push over a cliff).  This should be a government program, taken care of by taxes on everyone.  Medicare was *supposed* to be this, but its been horribly run and has exceeding cost estimates so badly its not funny.  Mostly because we're learning that when you make things virtually free, they consume a lot more of it.

Lower supply with a high demand means rising prices.  (And unfortunately it takes a better part of a decade to bring in new doctors.

The other major difference is that in the US, expensive techniques are more commonly used (knee replacement, CAT, MRI, etc).\n\nHealthcare is an entirely different set of solutions than \"health insurance\".  The only way to bring down the average cost for health insurance (while changing *nothing* with the quality, access, available of services) is to bring less-sickly people than the average into the pool, those who had not been participating because they felt invincible or had just made that decision.  But that's not insurance in this case, its just cost-sharing.\n\nYou could take a drastic turn and nationalize all the insurance companies, but that would only save something like $170 a year per US citizen (IIRC, I did the math in an old comment).

And then we also complain when it doesn't lay eggs.  Be honest and simply say \"we're going to ask the young to offset the additional cost that the elderly are paying\" and be done with it.\n\nIn my mind, we really need to have three \"levels\" of health programs in the country.  The first needs to be your typical routine care that *should not* be paid by insurance.  Physicals, etc.  These are small dollar, very likely events.  By insurance's nature, these are not the type to cover.  We can debate whether preventative care should be in this group or not - and while we're add it, lets admit that much of the \"preventative\" care we talk about is not really preventative - its detective.  Having a mammogram is *not* going to stop you from developing breast cancer.  It will *detect* it.\n\nSecond we would have the insurance layer.  This is for otherwise healthy people who just need coverage for when they do something stupid or have bad luck.  You know, high-cost, low risk items that insurance works perfectly to cover.\n\nThird we would have the \"chronic\" layer.  High-cost, high-risk items that insurance cannot cover but we also do not want to allow to simply suffer (or push over a cliff).  This should be a government program, taken care of by taxes on everyone.  Medicare was *supposed* to be this, but its been horribly run and has exceeding cost estimates so badly its not funny.

In a system that does not protect workers' rights, like the United States, incentive to work a menial job is small. You can get fired at any moment, your quality of life is pretty low, you can and will be treated like crap by many customers and by your boss(es). On the other hand, a system in which menial jobs are rewarded - not as much as other jobs, of course - means that even if your job is annoying and repetitive, you're treated like a normal member of society, your quality of life acceptable and you have a certain security - you know you're not going to get fired for no reason tomorrow.\n\nThen there are people who really don't want to work. You can't convince them to, and there'll always be people like that. But the minimal government handout for people who haven't worked in a long time is extremely tiny.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "selftext": "I don't want to speak for an entire group since \"liberal\" describes a lot of people, but I'll try answering your question from my point of view - somewhere left in the \"liberal\" field.\n\nThe only inalienable right is the right to *freedom* - not as in libertarian freedom, but free to do what you want as long as it doesn't physically or mentally harm others. Important consequence: hate speech is not a right, thus freedom of speech is not absolute.\n\nEveryone has a right to *happiness*. This is a very important and subjective concept, and many rights are consequences of this one. As long as you respect society's rules and do your part in helping the community, you have a right to live happily. Consenting adults have to be allowed to have sex any way they want, because otherwise they're not happy. Health care needs to be available to everyone because without it, people suffer or die, and that violates the right to happiness. Welfare needs to be available to people who need it for the same reason. However, this does not mean everyone can do whatever they want or get any benefits they want. If you being happy requires harming others, for instance, then you won't ever be happy because you can't violate rights in order to be happy. If you lose/quit your job and do nothing to get a new one, you do not have a right to government services because you'd be living off the community, not helping it.  \nAn important consequence of this right is that society must provide services aiming towards happiness - hospitals, health care, education (to get a job), and so on. It must also provide laws that prevent greedy (for money, power, you name it) people from exploiting others and depriving them of happiness - anti-crime laws, workers' rights, minimum wage, anti-monopoly laws, and so forth.\n\nHowever, the right to happiness is *not* inalienable. Society is allowed to \"balance\" happiness.  \nReal-world example: some people need to get really drunk to be happy. But getting completely drunk implies a higher risk of accidents, crimes, illnesses and so on. Since all of these consequences result in people (including the ones getting drunk) being harmed, they're harmful to society. Thus, society must deny a way towards happiness to some people in order to preserve others' right to happiness.  \nSociety is also allowed to protect people from themselves - that is, if someone wants to do something they think will be good but that may have disastrous consequences, even if only for themselves, they can be banned from doing so. This is because society as a whole is harmed if one of its member is. Another real-world example: bike helmets. If you don't wear a bike helmet on your bike, you risk only harming yourself. But if you get harmed, society has to help you, using resources that could be better used if you had worn a helmet. If you die in an accident, your friends and family will be mentally harmed, they'll get less resources to do what they want (especially if you had kids), society will lose a member that helped provide services to everyone (through work or taxes). Therefore, society can force you to wear a bike helmet.\n\nI think the most important part is that rights are not strictly defined. You can't objectively say what people are allowed to do and what isn't - some people will consider some trade-offs acceptable while others won't (note how I used \"can\" and \"is allowed to\" to describe some of the rights of society over its members, not \"must\"). The people have to decide. Which is, of course, a problem. But ideologies that involve absolute and objective rights also have to make compromises - they just don't allow any control over said compromises.\n\nAfter writing this, I checked what the Urban Dictionary had to say and (miraculously) found one nice definition you may be interested in: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=liberal&amp;defid=731439", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "josephcmiller2", "id": "t1_c8u8t5t", "parent_id": "t1_c8u8cez", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1431561187, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thank you.

For libertarians/many conservatives, at least in the U.S., an equal society is a society in which everyone has equal opportunity. Importantly, this does *not* mean that everyone actually ends up equal, just that everyone has an equal *chance* of becoming rich/famous/successful/etc. For liberals/progressives, an equal society is one in which everyone has equal *outcomes*, i.e. everyone in the society has the same amount of money/power.

I think this is my fault though as \"Why\" questions are unclear.\n\n&gt;Its definition is objective, which means a law against it cannot be abused.\n\nWhile being capable of an objective definition is *necessary*, that is not in-and-of itself a reason to outlaw something. Therefore, I'm not compelled to support outlawing something simply because it has an objective definition. \n\nLikewise, I'm not compelled to support every law that I find that I feel cannot be a abused.\n(I'm not entirely sure if I agree that it could not be abused but I'm not confident enough to hold my ground on that one.)\n\n&gt;It provides no benefits to others.\n\nAgain, I'm not compelled to outlaw things because I don't believe they benefit others. \n\n&gt;No human group, regardless of how you divide, should be the subject of constant threats, insults and victimization. Nobody should be told they're inferior.\n\nI agree with this. My assessment is that telling others they are inferior is immoral. But again, I'm not compelled to outlaw all things that are immoral. Adultery is immoral, but I don't want to fine or imprison people that commit it. Lying is immoral, but I'm not interested in passing a law that punishes people for lying.\n\nOutside of morality, I'm not sure how one can decide what people \"should\" be subject to. \n\nAlso, just in case it becomes important, I'd like to point out that I am differentiating between hate speech and harassment.\n\n&gt;It's likely that most of the right-wing terrorists in the U.S. (who cause most of the terrorism, see this graph) are influenced by the constant hate spewed by right-wing extremists.\n\nSetting aside the obvious bias, I think this is the most compelling reason to outlaw hate speech. Rhetoric motivates people to action. Hateful rhetoric may motivate people to violent action - regardless of what they're political affiliations are. This is certainly why hate speech needs to be addressed in some way. But how do we address it? Is outlawing hate speech really the best way to address it?\n\nThe government can charge people for hate speech, but they can't stop hate. The only way to do that is through social change - and that doesn't necessarily require the government.\n\nAlso, I'd like to point out that under libertarianism, iirc, we're free to pass laws against hate speech on the state or local level. This offers a certain amount of freedom since I can judge the laws of the state/county I live in and decide if I want to continue living there or not. If laws against hate speech are extremely important to me, I can support efforts to pass those laws in my own state/county, or move to a state/county that already has them. Others may feel uncomfortable with laws against hate speech, feeling that they can and will be abused. Those people have the same freedom I do.\n\nThe big disadvantage to passing laws on the federal level is the reduced freedom of choice.\n\nSo, it seems to me that the position that hate speech should be outlawed isn't really a reason to reject libertarianism, *unless* you feel hate speech *must* be outlawed on the federal level.\n\nSo, I'll rephrase my question: \nTaking into consideration that\n\n* 1.) under libertarianism, hate speech can still be outlawed on more local levels and \n* 2.) passing laws on the federal level reduces our freedom to choose what laws we live under and\n* 3.) hate speech can be addressed in other ways\n\ndo the advantages (whatever they may be) of outlawing hate speech on the federal level outweigh the disadvantages?

Hopefully that will change someday, but I'm definitely not qualified in any way to recommend any mechanisms for social change. Nevertheless, I feel social change is a real thing.\n\nYou pointed out that racism is still present in the U.S. This is true, though it is significantly less prevalent than it used to be - and we haven't outlawed racism. This is a very good example of social change.\n\nThere are laws that are tangentially related to racism like anti-discrimination laws and hate crime laws. Some of these laws are ineffective - job discrimination is still a problem - while others are effective but not enough so - hate crimes are punished but still occur.\n\nClearly, social change is both effective and necessary whether we pass these kinds of laws or not.\n\n&gt;Should the majority have the freedom to make life hell for minorities? Should the majority get to decide whether minorities can live a correct life?\n\nAbsolutely not, which is why people should have the freedom to live under a set of rules they choose. Far from facilitating a tyranny of the majority, Libertarianism gives people the opportunity to live in they way most desire whether they are (for instance) gay or homophobic.\n\nA tyranny of the majority can only be effective if it is enacted on the federal level.\n\n&gt;But there is no such thing as the freedom to harm others, mentally or physically.\n\nLibertarianism would agree that attacking another persons autonomy is not a part of the freedom it supports. I'm not too sure what \"mental\" harm is but I would point out that if it is a concept that is coherent and important to you, you're free to move to a state/county that has it on the books. This would allow you to live in a community you are comfortable with while not risking the same kind of tyranny that you want to prevent.\n\nEdit: I sound like a libertarian apologist.

I think this is my fault though as \"Why\" questions are unclear.\n\n&gt;Its definition is objective, which means a law against it cannot be abused.\n\nWhile being capable of an objective definition is *necessary*, that is not in-and-of itself a reason to outlaw something. Therefore, I'm not compelled to support outlawing something simply because it has an objective definition. \n\nLikewise, I'm not compelled to support every law that I find that I feel cannot be a abused.\n(I'm not entirely sure if I agree that it could not be abused but I'm not confident enough to hold my ground on that one.)\n\n&gt;It provides no benefits to others.\n\nAgain, I'm not compelled to outlaw things because I don't believe they benefit others. \n\n&gt;No human group, regardless of how you divide, should be the subject of constant threats, insults and victimization. Nobody should be told they're inferior.\n\nI agree with this. My assessment is that telling others they are inferior is immoral. But again, I'm not compelled to outlaw all things that are immoral. Adultery is immoral, but I don't want to fine or imprison people that commit it. Lying is immoral, but I'm not interested in passing a law that punishes people for lying.\n\nOutside of morality, I'm not sure how one can decide what people \"should\" be subject to. \n\nAlso, just in case it becomes important, I'd like to point out that I am differentiating between hate speech and harassment.\n\n&gt;It's likely that most of the right-wing terrorists in the U.S. (who cause most of the terrorism, see this graph) are influenced by the constant hate spewed by right-wing extremists.\n\nSetting aside the obvious bias, I think this is the most compelling reason to outlaw hate speech. Rhetoric motivates people to action. Hateful rhetoric may motivate people to violent action - regardless of what they're political affiliations are. This is certainly why hate speech needs to be addressed in some way. But how do we address it? Is outlawing hate speech really the best way to address it?\n\nThe government can charge people for hate speech, but they can't stop hate. The only way to do that is through social change - and that doesn't necessarily require the government.\n\nAlso, I'd like to point out that under libertarianism, iirc, we're free to pass laws against hate speech on the state or local level. This offers a certain amount of freedom since I can judge the laws of the state/county I live in and decide if I want to continue living there or not. If laws against hate speech are extremely important to me, I can support efforts to pass those laws in my own state/county, or move to a state/county that already has them. Others may feel uncomfortable with laws against hate speech, feeling that they can and will be abused. Those people have the same freedom I do.\n\nThe big disadvantage to passing laws on the federal level is the reduced freedom of choice.\n\nSo, it seems to me that the position that hate speech should be outlawed isn't really a reason to reject libertarianism, *unless* you feel hate speech *must* be outlawed on the federal level.\n\nSo, I'll rephrase my question: \nTaking into consideration that\n\n* 1.) under libertarianism, hate speech can still be outlawed on more local levels and \n* 2.) passing laws on the federal level reduces our freedom to choose what laws we live under and\n* 3.) hate speech can be addressed in other ways\n\ndo the advantages (whatever they may be) of outlawing hate speech on the federal level outweigh the disadvantages?

I'm not too sure what \"mental\" harm is but I would point out that if it is a concept that is coherent and important to you, you're free to move to a state/county that has it on the books. This would allow you to live in a community you are comfortable with while not risking the same kind of tyranny that you want to prevent.\n\nEdit: I sound like a libertarian apologist.

I think this is my fault though as \"Why\" questions are unclear.\n\n&gt;Its definition is objective, which means a law against it cannot be abused.\n\nWhile being capable of an objective definition is *necessary*, that is not in-and-of itself a reason to outlaw something. Therefore, I'm not compelled to support outlawing something simply because it has an objective definition. \n\nLikewise, I'm not compelled to support every law that I find that I feel cannot be a abused.\n(I'm not entirely sure if I agree that it could not be abused but I'm not confident enough to hold my ground on that one.)\n\n&gt;It provides no benefits to others.\n\nAgain, I'm not compelled to outlaw things because I don't believe they benefit others. \n\n&gt;No human group, regardless of how you divide, should be the subject of constant threats, insults and victimization. Nobody should be told they're inferior.\n\nI agree with this. My assessment is that telling others they are inferior is immoral. But again, I'm not compelled to outlaw all things that are immoral. Adultery is immoral, but I don't want to fine or imprison people that commit it. Lying is immoral, but I'm not interested in passing a law that punishes people for lying.\n\nOutside of morality, I'm not sure how one can decide what people \"should\" be subject to. \n\nAlso, just in case it becomes important, I'd like to point out that I am differentiating between hate speech and harassment.\n\n&gt;It's likely that most of the right-wing terrorists in the U.S. (who cause most of the terrorism, see this graph) are influenced by the constant hate spewed by right-wing extremists.\n\nSetting aside the obvious bias, I think this is the most compelling reason to outlaw hate speech. Rhetoric motivates people to action. Hateful rhetoric may motivate people to violent action - regardless of what they're political affiliations are. This is certainly why hate speech needs to be addressed in some way. But how do we address it? Is outlawing hate speech really the best way to address it?\n\nThe government can charge people for hate speech, but they can't stop hate. The only way to do that is through social change - and that doesn't necessarily require the government.\n\nAlso, I'd like to point out that under libertarianism, iirc, we're free to pass laws against hate speech on the state or local level. This offers a certain amount of freedom since I can judge the laws of the state/county I live in and decide if I want to continue living there or not. If laws against hate speech are extremely important to me, I can support efforts to pass those laws in my own state/county, or move to a state/county that already has them. Others may feel uncomfortable with laws against hate speech, feeling that they can and will be abused. Those people have the same freedom I do.\n\nThe big disadvantage to passing laws on the federal level is the reduced freedom of choice.\n\nSo, it seems to me that the position that hate speech should be outlawed isn't really a reason to reject libertarianism, *unless* you feel hate speech *must* be outlawed on the federal level.\n\nSo, I'll rephrase my question: \nTaking into consideration that\n\n* 1.) under libertarianism, hate speech can still be outlawed on more local levels and \n* 2.) passing laws on the federal level reduces our freedom to choose what laws we live under and\n* 3.) hate speech can be addressed in other ways\n\ndo the advantages (whatever they may be) of outlawing hate speech on the federal level outweigh the disadvantages? (reduced freedom for everybody) Why or why not?\n\nI apologize if this seems like an ambush.

I'll try anyway. \n\nLibertarianism's central principle is that it is wrong to force a rule on somebody without giving them the choice to leave. As you've pointed out though, people have the choice to leave the US. So technically we *do* have the freedom to chose. \n\nWe could also tell people they must follow our rules or commit suicide. That would *technically* give us the freedom of choice but it would also entail too much of a sacrifice to be considered true freedom. \n\nObviously, committing suicide and moving to another country are very different, but they share something in common: they both require too much of a sacrifice to be considered good alternatives in a free country.\n\n&gt;If the U.S. pass a law, you're free to move to Canada, Mexico or any other country on this planet if you don't like it.\n\nI've already addressed this point.\n\n&gt;Racism is still present in the American society (and in most others). Slavery was abolished over a century ago. What effective ways to quickly end hate do you suggest?\n\nTo be honest, I'm not too sure. I'm in my mid-twenties and I lift heavy objects for a living. Hopefully that will change someday, but I'm definitely not qualified in any way to recommend any mechanisms for social change. Nevertheless, I feel social change is a real thing.\n\nYou pointed out that racism is still present in the U.S. This is true, though it is significantly less prevalent than it used to be - and we haven't outlawed racism. This is a very good example of social change.\n\nThere are laws that are tangentially related to racism like anti-discrimination laws and hate crime laws. Some of these laws are ineffective - job discrimination is still a problem - while others are effective but not enough so - hate crimes are punished but still occur.\n\nClearly, social change is both effective and necessary whether we pass these kinds of laws or not.\n\n&gt;Should the majority have the freedom to make life hell for minorities? Should the majority get to decide whether minorities can live a correct life?\n\nAbsolutely not, which is why people should have the freedom to live under a set of rules they choose. Far from facilitating a tyranny of the majority, Libertarianism gives people the opportunity to live in they way most desire whether they are (for instance) gay or homophobic.\n\nA tyranny of the majority can only be effective if it is enacted on the federal level.\n\n&gt;But there is no such thing as the freedom to harm others, mentally or physically.\n\nLibertarianism would agree that attacking another persons autonomy is not a part of the freedom it supports. I'm not too sure what \"mental\" harm is but I would point out that if it is a concept that is coherent and important to you, you're free to move to a state/county that has it on the books. This would allow you to live in a community you are comfortable with while not risking the same kind of tyranny that you want to prevent.\n\nEdit: I sound like a libertarian apologist.

I think this is my fault though as \"Why\" questions are unclear.\n\n&gt;Its definition is objective, which means a law against it cannot be abused.\n\nWhile being capable of an objective definition is *necessary*, that is not in-and-of itself a reason to outlaw something. Therefore, I'm not compelled to support outlawing something simply because it has an objective definition. \n\nLikewise, I'm not compelled to support every law that I find that I feel cannot be a abused.\n(I'm not entirely sure if I agree that it could not be abused but I'm not confident enough to hold my ground on that one.)\n\n&gt;It provides no benefits to others.\n\nAgain, I'm not compelled to outlaw things because I don't believe they benefit others. \n\n&gt;No human group, regardless of how you divide, should be the subject of constant threats, insults and victimization. Nobody should be told they're inferior.\n\nI agree with this. My assessment is that telling others they are inferior is immoral. But again, I'm not compelled to outlaw all things that are immoral. Adultery is immoral, but I don't want to fine or imprison people that commit it. Lying is immoral, but I'm not interested in passing a law that punishes people for lying.\n\nOutside of morality, I'm not sure how one can decide what people \"should\" be subject to. \n\nAlso, just in case it becomes important, I'd like to point out that I am differentiating between hate speech and harassment.\n\n&gt;It's likely that most of the right-wing terrorists in the U.S. (who cause most of the terrorism, see this graph) are influenced by the constant hate spewed by right-wing extremists.\n\nSetting aside the obvious bias, I think this is the most compelling reason to outlaw hate speech. Rhetoric motivates people to action. Hateful rhetoric may motivate people to violent action - regardless of what they're political affiliations are. This is certainly why hate speech needs to be addressed in some way. But how do we address it? Is outlawing hate speech really the best way to address it?\n\nThe government can charge people for hate speech, but they can't stop hate. The only way to do that is through social change - and that doesn't necessarily require the government.\n\nAlso, I'd like to point out that under libertarianism, iirc, we're free to pass laws against hate speech on the state or local level. This offers a certain amount of freedom since I can judge the laws of the state/county I live in and decide if I want to continue living there or not. If laws against hate speech are extremely important to me, I can support efforts to pass those laws in my own state/county, or move to a state/county that already has them. Others may feel uncomfortable with laws against hate speech, feeling that they can and will be abused. Those people have the same freedom I do.\n\nThe big disadvantage to passing laws on the federal level is the reduced freedom of choice.\n\nSo, it seems to me that the position that hate speech should be outlawed isn't really a reason to reject libertarianism, *unless* you feel hate speech *must* be outlawed on the federal level.\n\nSo, I'll rephrase my question: \nTaking into consideration that\n\n* 1.) under libertarianism, hate speech can still be outlawed on more local levels and \n* 2.) passing laws on the federal level reduces our freedom to choose what laws we live under and\n* 3.) hate speech can be addressed in other ways\n\ndo the advantages (whatever they may be) of outlawing hate speech on the federal level outweigh the disadvantages? (reduced freedom for everybody) Why or why not?\n\nI apologize if this seems like an ambush.

Now, whether that equals access to healthcare is another issue entirely...\n\n&gt;Do U.S. employees have a right to a decent minimum wage? No.\n\nThis is an economic debate for the ages, but you can quickly find arguments on both sides whether a minimum wage is a good thing.  Many show that it doesn't [help reduce poverty and majority move to higher rates within the first year (Anti-Minimum Wage website)](http://www.minimumwage.com/).

Yes.\n\nYou're talking about [employment-at-will](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At-will_employment) laws.

Note that discrimination law still apply even in these states and that it does not restrict unions from forming.  The fact that the South is largely not unionized, especially the [auto industry](http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2011/10/uaw-not-welcome-in-the-south/), shows that this is not as much of an issue as people fret over.

{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "link_id": "t3_17cz5c", "selftext": "One of the consequences of the two-party system is that the parties have opposite views on pretty much everything - if party 1 thinks XYZ is right, party 2 will campaign against it. Franklin D. Roosevelt was a socialist, therefore the Republicans became a right-wing party.\n\nDuring the Cold War, communists were the enemy. Since communism is supposed to be the extreme left, it was natural that the right-wing party would react the strongest. A well-known example is Sen. McCarthy (R-WI), who took it one step further and opposed \"communistic atheism\" and Christianity (read McCarthy's infamous [Speech at Wheeling, West Virginia](http://wps.prenhall.com/wps/media/objects/108/110880/ch26_a5_d2.pdf) for more). He suggested that Democrats, the State Department and even the Army were infiltrated by communists (but didn't have any evidence, eventually leading McCarthy to be censured by the Senate). That kind of behavior opened the door for Christian fanatics to be accepted into the GOP. McCarthyism is also the reason the U.S. motto is now \"In God We Trust\" rather than the old \"E Pluribus Unum\" (\"Out of many, one\").\n\nThen there's the fact that religion opposes most changes to the \"traditional\" society because religion was modeled after the traditional society. There are no rational arguments against gay marriage, for example, which is why conservatives invoke religion. The same goes for abortion and other progressive goals.\n\nBringing religion into politics provides a huge advantage for the religious party. Religious fanatics usually lack proper education, making it easy to pretend their holy book says this or that while ignoring the parts you don't want. Nowadays, the GOP has a solid base of religious voters who will not, ever, vote for another party because they are convinced that Republicans do God's work and anyone who opposes them is a heretic or an evil atheist. \n\nThe main problem, though, is that you can't throw them out. The more you use religion, the more people become religious (to a certain extent), but these people will not go back to normality. The U.S. overall vote is almost perfectly split between the two major parties. If the GOP decided to get rid of their religious section or to try and calm it down, the ensuing three-party system would guarantee a Democratic win in virtually every national election. Therefore, Republican candidates and elected officials have to bend over backwards to make sure the \"Religious Right\" is satisfied with their job. That's why there are so many intrusive laws promoted by the GOP that go against their \"small government\" mindset, that's why some lawmakers have to pretend they'll try to arrest ATF officers and that's why Boehner has to pretend they'll try to repeal abortion rights.\n\nIt's a timebomb, though, and it looks like it'll blow up in the near future. Republicans would have regained the Senate if it wasn't for Sharron Angle, Christine O'Donnell, Todd Akin, Richard Mourdock and other ultra-conservatives deemed too stupid by the majority. Mitt Romney lost last November because he had been forced to move very far to the right to get the religious vote, angering normal people. It's worth noting that after Romney shifted to the left in the first debate, he was ahead in the polls for a while.", "id": "t1_c84dxc4", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "Aethec", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c84ngxn", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "super_mustard", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "id": "t1_c85c8bb", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "dirty3thirty", "children": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2t160", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "Ask_Politics", "children": [], "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "author": "aBrightIdea", "id": "t1_c85m1tz", "parent_id": "t1_c85c8bb", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1435636872, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Liberation Theology is a very interesting and fast growing Catholic doctrine.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_17cz5c", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c85m1tz", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": "1359469302", "distinguished": null, "ups": 2}], "parent_id": "t1_c84ngxn", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1431112980, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Very true I think that a lot of this is because the religious \"fanatics\" may be outnumbered 10-1 by \"normal\" religious but by their nature you hear and remember the 1 screaming fanatic over the ten normals in the room.

Had they not had guns, they'd have had to use knives, iron bars or other weapons which a) allow the potential victim to get away and b) force the attacked to realize he's about to kill someone instead of shooting first and thinking about it afterwards.\n\nPS: Switzerland's \"universal gun ownership\" is a myth.
